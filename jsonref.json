[{"url":null,"title":"The EU lagging UK preparing No Deal Brexit","story":"Share this article At least 50 trade associations and thousands of companies from all areas of the UK\u0027s economy were consulted to deliver 200 recommendations in the report by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).   Mr Hardie said: \u0027It cannot be beyond the wit of the continent\u0027s greatest negotiators to find a way through and agree a deal.\u0027But until this becomes a reality, all must prepare to leave without one. The EU must come to the table and commit - at the very least - to matching the UK\u0027s sensible mitigations. \u0027Failure to do so will hurt all our economies. While the UK\u0027s preparations to date are welcome, the unprecedented nature of Brexit means some aspects cannot be mitigated. We can reduce but not remove the damage of no deal.\u0027It\u0027s not just about queues at ports the invisible impact of severing services trade overnight would harm firms across the country. Preparing for no deal is devilishly difficult. But it is right to prepare.\u0027The group welcomed Britain\u0027s preparations for Brexit, but said that the \u0027unprecedented nature\u0027 of exiting the bloc meant \u0027some aspects cannot be mitigated\u0027.The CBI also said: \u0027The EU lags behind the UK in seeking to prevent the worst effects of a No Deal scenario.\u0027And although businesses have already spent billions on contingency planning for no-deal, they remain hampered by unclear advice, timelines, cost and complexity.\u0027The report - titled What Comes Next? The Business Analysis Of No Deal Preparations - added: \u0027Larger companies, particularly those in regulated areas such as financial services, have well-thought-through contingency plans in place, though smaller firms are less well prepared.\u0027In late May, the CBI warned against a no-deal Brexit, with its director-general Carolyn Fairbairn saying it should be an option \u0027that is not even considered\u0027.         In its latest report, the confederation advised the Government to undertake a review and to update all technical notices and Brexit preparation advice by the middle of August.The CBI also recommended business engagement meetings with the EU resume and additional parliamentary time be set aside to complete no-deal legislation by the end of August.A communications campaign with \u0027simple and clear advice\u0027 for UK firms would need to be launched by the beginning of September, while by the start of the next month the Government would need to publish its \u0027crucial preparedness measures\u0027, it said.The CBI said trials of Britain\u0027s crucial IT systems would need to be scaled up by the middle of October.The confederation also recommended that the EU begin drafting communications and devising temporary measures in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The CBI\u0027s head of EU negotiations Nicole Sykes said \u0027a lot needs to be done, by everyone\u0027.But she warned in a series of tweets that even with more preparations, there would still be adverse effects from a no deal Brexit. Would it make a difference? Yes. And we should do what we can\u0027.  Vauxhall owner threatens to AXE Ellesmere Port plant by moving Astra production abroad after No Deal BrexitThe Vauxhall plant at Ellesmere Port could be axed after No Deal, the head of the company warned today.   Carlos Tavares, chief executive of parent firm PSA, threatened to move construction of future Vauxhall Astras and Opel Astras to southern Europe if post-Brexit trading terms were not satisfactory.The move would almost certainly lead to the closure of the site in Cheshire, putting 1,000 jobs at risk.Mr Tavares told the Financial Times: \u0027Frankly I would prefer to put it (the Astra car) in Ellesmere Port but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable then I have to protect the rest of the company and I will not do it.\u0027We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port.\u0027           Shifting production of future Astra models from Ellesmere Port (file picture) would almost certainly lead to the closure of the site in Cheshire, putting 1,000 jobs at riskThe warning came after the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told Mr Johnson on Friday that a no-deal Brexit was an \u0027existential threat\u0027 to the industry.Over the weekend, Mr Johnson set up a new structure of Government committees to try to ensure Brexit by Halloween.The Daily Operations Committee, chaired by Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, will meet every weekday in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms and will be responsible for overseeing all of the Government\u0027s preparations for leaving the EU, and a possible no-deal exit.The committee will meet for the first time tomorrow and a Downing Street source said it was being structured in such a way so that the Treasury would be \u0027a motor for delivering Brexit, not the anchor\u0027.Downing Street has also announced an Exit, Economy and Trade Committee will be chaired by the Prime Minister and meet regularly.It will \u0027have a broad remit and will handle write rounds\u0027, particularly focused on Britain\u0027s future relationships around the world.The Exit Strategy committee, known as XS, will meet twice a week and be chaired by the PM.XS will meet for the first time on Monday, when it will be chaired by Mr Gove in the absence of the Prime Minister.Mr Johnson will chair the following meeting of the committee on Thursday, Downing Street said.The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, reported that Mr Johnson was set to launch the biggest advertising campaign since the Second World War to get Britain ready for a no-deal Brexit.A £100 million advertising campaign will be launched to prepare the country for no-deal, according to the newspaper.Newly appointed trade minister Conor Burns welcomed the Brexit ad blitz but criticised the previous Government\u0027s failure to adequately fund for no-deal.He told BBC Radio 4 Westminster Hour: \u0027It is really important that businesses that are not yet geared up, get geared up because this is hoving into reality.\u0027It is a very serious possibility and I just wish the previous government which was not led by Boris had got on with this a lot earlier.\u0027           Over the weekend, Boris Johnson (pictured giving a speech in Manchester on Saturday) set up a new structure of Government committees to try to ensure Brexit by HalloweenMr Burns added: \u0027Showing that we are aggressively preparing, showing that the Treasury Hammond gloom is behind us and the Treasury are financing the preparations for no-deal is the best way for us to approach our European partners and say, \u0027look we want a deal and let\u0027s get back round the table and let\u0027s sort this out\u0027.\u0027I just wish the previous government which was not led by Boris had got on with this a lot earlier.\u0027The Institute for Government (IfG) has advised Mr Johnson that a no-deal Brexit would dominate Government\u0027s agenda \u0027for years to come\u0027.The Prime Minister will need to kick-start the Government\u0027s no-deal preparations immediately by moving thousands of public servants into operational facilities, the IfG said in a paper released on Sunday.It added that Mr Johnson would also have to introduce legislation ensuring direct rule in Northern Ireland from October 31.Regardless of these measures, after a no-deal Brexit the resources of the Parliament and civil service would be drained and struggling businesses would need Government support, the IfG paper said."},{"url":null,"title":"ITV presenter Eamonn Holmes reveals school bus taken hostage IRA Northern Ireland","story":"Share this article He told the White Wine Question Time podcast: \u0027Our bus was hijacked on the Antrim Road. \u0027And this man wearing a balaclava came on and said \u0027We are commandeering this bus for the Irish Republican Army.\u0027He starts sprinkling petrol everywhere so we get off.

A judge at the High Court (pictured) found she was unlawfully detained and deportedInvestigators added the woman had not provided any evidence of a same-sex relationship in the UK or Uganda.In a judgement, published by Mr Justice Lewis this month, he ruled the woman was denied the chance to show she had been in a lesbian relationship in Uganda.He ruled the fast track appeals system - first introduced by Tony Blair\u0027s government in 2005 - did not give PN sufficient time to get evidence to support her claim. Mr Justice Lewis quashed the decision and ordered the Home Secretary to \u0027use his best endeavours to facilitate the return of PN to the UK.\u0027PN is entitled to claim financial damages from from the government because she was unlawfully detained and deported. Homosexuality is illegal in Uganda and the LGBT community can often face violence and discrimination. Movement for Justice, a human rights group helping to support the woman told The Guardian the Home Office would likely appeal the decision.         The woman says she was gang raped after she returned to Uganda, pictured in a file photoA Home Office spokesman was not able to confirm when PN would be returning to the UK, or the likely amount of damages. PN insisted after being caught in bed with a man that they had not had sex on that occasion, although she also admitted that she was seeing him because she \u0027wanted a child\u0027.In later interviews, PN explained that she realised she was a lesbian at about 13 after being raped five years earlier by her stepfather. PN then alleged that she\u0027d had a number of affairs with women.Her first relationship, she said, was with a woman called Grace, aged about 20, when she was 14. It lasted for three months. The same year, she said, she had an affair with a woman called Justine who was 22.This relationship was discovered by two youths who secretly watched the two women making love. Local vigilantes then threatened violence against her family, she said.Her last gay relationship in Uganda was, she claimed, with a 21-year-old woman called Rose, who arranged her escape by buying her a false passport to come to the UK.Once in Britain, PN says that she had a relationship with a woman called Ruth, although she produced no evidence. She also claimed she was in a relationship with a married woman called Mildred.That said, despite being held in detention at Yarl\u0027s Wood for several months, the mysterious Mildred did not visit her and PN could produce no proof that she existed.         Home Office officials said when they raided PN\u0027s flat they found her in bed with a man - PN says they never had sexOnly Rose could be found. She was living in Uganda and very belatedly produced an affidavit confirming her affair with PN.Despite this, the Home Office ruled: \u0027The only reliable evidence was that PN was found in bed with a man and . . . the only reasonable conclusion is that she is in a heterosexual relationship with this man and is not a lesbian.\u0027 As a result, PN was taken to an airport in December 2013 to be flown back to Uganda. But the pressure group intervened, confronting the UK immigration team at the airport and PN was subsequently returned to Yarl\u0027s Wood. \u0027The guards cancelled my ticket to go on Ethiopian Airways,\u0027 PN explains on the recording.On a second attempt to send her home, also with Ethiopian Airlines, she was escorted onto the plane. But it is understood that after a passenger outcry in sympathy for PN, the pilot refused to fly her back to Uganda.It was only on the third occasion that PN was finally removed from Britain — on Kenya Airways. She explained: \u0027When we reached the airport, I was in a van and they lifted me to the plane.\u0027There were three seats and I was in the middle. There were two female guards each side. They put me in handcuffs and pinned my arms down.

We need your learned opinions to winnow this down to a shortlist next weekThis year’s Booker longlist has been described as “an absolute gift for bookselling” and seems popular with critics and the book-buying public alike, which is excellent. I hope it’s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn’t as long as our longlist.This year, a mighty 170 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That’s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it’s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist.The first part of that process is to whittle down 163 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more – one selected by last year’s judges and one from each of our two nominated book champions for this year, Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh.And when I say “we”, I really mean “you”. This is part of the competition that you control, because it’s your vote that will help decide which three books go forward into the next round.Voting is easy – or it will be if you read the following instructions carefully:In order for your vote to be counted and comply with our all killer, no filler terms and conditions, you need to choose two books from the longlist below, from two different publishers, and accompany those choices with a short review of at least one of your chosen books.

Annual results published more than 10 hours late on Friday revealed that Sports Direct was struggling during tough trading conditions on the high street.The delay was caused by the sudden arrival of a €674m initial bill from the Belgian authorities, relating to VAT charges on goods moved within the EU. Sports Direct only has 35 stores in Belgium but has two warehouses in the country.Sports Direct defended its handling of the matter after the stock market closed on Monday. The company said it received notice of the tax bill at midday on Thursday and contacted its lawyers immediately. It did not receive further details of the demand until 11pm on Thursday, meaning its auditor Grant Thornton had to update its audit the next day.Logistics experts said the VAT bill could relate to either the movement of goods between Belgium and the retailer’s main distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, or online sales.“The home truths about the core Sports Direct business were pretty shocking and management seems to be out of ideas,” said analysts at the brokerage firm Peel Hunt. “Whilst Sports Direct may have done all the likes of Nike and Adidas asked them to do in the flagship stores, the premium product that maybe it was expecting as a consequence has not emerged. And it doesn’t sound like that is about to change.”“Sports Direct now seems to be strategically snookered, checkmated and clean bowled. The shares are hard to value, but are surely only for the very brave.”David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities and head of UK equities at Aviva Investors, told the BBC on Monday: “Sports Direct is almost a case study in failed corporate governance.” He said Ashley “has obviously got retail talent – or had retail talent”, but the firm had “lost its way”.In the annual results, Ashley said the state of House of Fraser, which his company bought out of administration, had created “significant uncertainty” as to the future profitability of the entire group. He warned of further store closures at the department store chain and said he regretted the acquisition. The results also revealed that a consultancy business owned by Michael Murray, the fiancé of Ashley’s daughter, Anna, will be paid £5.35m for “value created” for Sports Direct last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27be089055186ed1d08f1a62d944fd3e7b2b0dbb/0_152_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb95e5df7a936645e895aa33d191440","title":"jeremy corbyn labour party brexit","story":"Though I would win my appeal against expulsion, your losing mentality and lack of Brexit leadership mean I won’t returnBritain is in a moment of peril, the UK facing an existential crisis, a combination of Brexit and Boris Johnson reducing our country to a global laughing stock. I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it. Whatever the denials, Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election – setting up the EU, parliament and the civil service, in a grotesque perversion of the truth, as the reasons he has no option but to call one.He rightly fears that if the people were given a straight choice in a referendum, “no deal v no Brexit”, no Brexit would win comfortably. But Johnson is confident that in an election choice between him and you he would win, and so get the mandate for the hardest form of Brexit he would otherwise not legitimately be able to claim. It means we could be weeks from an election in which, on any current analysis, you are unlikely to be in a position to win a majority.The future of the country is a million times more important than my membership of the Labour party. But the above situation has developed at a time this has been the subject of some public debate, as well as intense personal reflection.Having spent several weeks trying without success to have explained to me the process under which I was expelled for voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections, I finally informed the party I felt I had no option but to start proceedings. I was recently told that my case had been discussed with senior members of your team and that they saw two ways it might be addressed: 1. By a suspension of my auto-exclusion under cover of the broader possible review of the whole auto-exclusion system in relation to antisemitism and other offences. 2. That I make some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election. On the first, I was not asking for a suspension of my exclusion, but a reversal. On the second, while with the one exception that led to my expulsion I have voted Labour in every election in my life and would prefer to do so for the rest of my days, I did not feel comfortable about making a blanket commitment when politics is in such flux, and my concern about your stance on Brexit still acute.With the distance provided by my being away from the UK in Australia, I have reflected deeply on all of the above. And, with some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, even if I should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.The culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain. I see no strategy in place that remotely meets the electoral or policy challenges ahead. On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose.I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. I do not blame you for Brexit and the mess the UK is in. David Cameron and Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, and the UK media, they are all ahead of you in the queue on that one. But I do believe your half-hearted approach to the referendum campaign three years ago had a role in leave winning. Your failure to provide consistent leadership on the issue since then has been a huge disappointment. I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election, and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends. It is not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision. What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril. To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause – though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters. I have in the past, in various troubled eras for our party, always argued that it is better to stay and fight from the inside. My fear right now is that without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power. With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election.If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you. I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.• Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair’s director of communications this is an edited version of an article written for The New European"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8afadbeeee868f6b2f9e8cf97dbba365f2740622/965_7_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8f9fa2667db0da63722bc5bf92f8737","title":"martin scorsese de niro pacino the irishman premiere new york film festival","story":"The gangster film, starring Robert De Niro as hitman Frank Sheeran and Al Pacino as union boss Jimmy Hoffa, will open the eventMartin Scorsese’s long anticipated gangster film The Irishman is to receive its world premiere as the opening film at the New York film festival.Described by the festival as “a richly textured epic of American crime, a dense, complex story told with astonishing fluidity”, The Irishman pairs Robert De Niro, as Irish-American hitman Frank Sheeran, with Al Pacino, who plays union boss Jimmy Hoffa. It is based on I Heard You Paint Houses, Charles Brandt’s book about Sheeran which claims he was responsible for Hoffa’s murder in 1975. Joe Pesci plays mafia boss Russell Bufalino.Festival director Kent Jones said The Irishman is “funny, troubling, entertaining and, like all great movies, absolutely singular”. He added: “It’s the work of masters, made with a command of the art of cinema that I’ve seen very rarely in my lifetime, and it plays out at a level of subtlety and human intimacy that truly stunned me.”The Irishman is Scorsese’s ninth collaboration with De Niro, and his fourth with Pesci, but is the first time that he has directed Pacino. De Niro and Pacino last acted together in 2008 crime thriller Righteous Kill.The project attracted some controversy after it was purchased by streaming giant Netflix in 2017 in the wake of the poor commercial performance of Scorsese’s previous film, the clerical drama Silence. However, Scorsese avoided a clash with the Cannes film festival earlier this year after it was reported the film was not finished in time. The French festival refuses to screen Netflix films due to regulations designed to ensure it champions cinema releases.The Irishman will be screened on 27 September at the New York film festival, and will be released in cinemas and on Netflix later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/376c5b344aaba8ca3c18ff6cc4e34e9036baa040/0_1141_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9d004ac784b8771bc0bdd6162c62848","title":"sicilian salted ricotta and tomato salad recipe","story":"Whey is teased by artful Sicilian hands into traditional salted ricotta, never better than when enjoyed in this simple tomato saladLorena is lifting ricotta from the 150-litre pan in the corner of the room into small, perforated tubs. It’s 10am. She has been at the caseificio (dairy) since just after 5am, along with her nephew, Aurelio. It is July and a combination of dog-day Sicilian heat and lambing means there’s less milk. Today there was just shy of 100 litres, from sheep kept by Lorena’s husband a few miles outside the city. Most of the work has already been done the milk has been heated with salt and rennet and, thanks to the alchemy of coagulation, separated into curds and whey. The curds have been cut and pressed into forms, at which point they are called tuma. The remaining whey in the huge pan will be used to cook the forms of tuma for a few hours, after which they will be called primo sale (first salt), until they are old enough to be pecorino Siciliano.I arrive to see what Lorena, once a hospital lab technician but now reborn as a cheesemaker, refers to as the guadagno pulito – her clean earnings, the something-for-nothing – the ricotta. If you’ve ever seen whey, you will probably agree that it is pretty unpromising, yellow and thin. However, it has more to give. Before the tuma is cooked, more milk and rennet are added to the whey, and it is recooked or reheated, and soft white clots, given the same name as the process, ricotta, come to the surface. From seemingly nothing, to something so wobbly and good, which seems a miraculous thing.As the clots of ricotta bob on the surface, floating like fat clouds, Lorena uses a slotted spoon with a scooping sweep to lift the ricotta into the perforated plastic pots. She also lifts some ricotta into a traditional cane cavagna, the containers my Sicilian partner remembers from childhood. A man on a motorbike with the cones hanging from the sides would putt-putt down the street, while the kids would wait on doorsteps with plates to receive the contents.Technically not a cheese but a latticino (milk product), ricotta seems all the more precious because it is made from something that would otherwise be thrown away. While ricotta is made all over southern Italy, varying by place, regional preferences and the season, Sicilian ricotta is notable for its tender, wobbly texture when freshly made – somewhere between junket and just-set scrambled egg. It has a clean, creamy, sweet-but-savoury, and just-a-bit sheepish flavour.While I am at the caseificio, customers arrive asking if the ricotta is ready, the steam from the pot misting their specs and sunglasses. Older customers bring pans to collect their portions, with some asking for extra siero (whey), of which there is plenty still in the pan. One man tells us that he will treat it like a soup and dip bread in while watching his favourite soap opera. Beyond eating it as soon as possible with bread, local recipes for ricotta include a filling for ravioli or gnocchi, as part of baked pasta or impanata (filled bread), for cakes, cannoli, or in the various fried pastries that fill the counters.With its ephemeral wobble, fresh ricotta is not an enduring food, especially in summer, so people have found ways of preserving it by salting. Traditionally done at home in dark corners with trays of salt, salted ricotta is now made on both a small and large scale. Lorena shows me how to rub a three-day old ricotta with salt until it is encrusted. After this, it will take a month, a second salting and careful draining for 500g of fresh ricotta to shrink into a round, ricotta salata a quarter of its original size.The texture, too, is transformed – from soft to firm, and compact enough to be grated, or pared into crumbly-edged slices. Salting transforms the flavour, too: creamy and shy wobbles are given sharp, salty edges, with that sheepishness becoming more pronounced.Ricotta salata is essential for pasta alla norma and makes a brilliant grating cheese. It is also a natural partner for tomatoes – especially small and sweet cherry ones – and today’s salad. Halve 500g cherry tomatoes, finely slice a medium-sized red onion, drizzle with eight tablespoons of olive oil and grate over (or finely slice) 75g salted ricotta. It’s a favourite summer salad served alongside sausages or fish.While Lorena wraps my cone, we decide that, unlike its fresh form, ricotta salata is also a good traveller. Which, for those of us who don’t live opposite a Sicilian caseificio, can only be a good thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b40d39818c2464886548d39303cabc18a1a0dd7/0_34_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=233e7ced8e464099c336cf73ea822786","title":"bury suspend efl league one match mk dons","story":"Bury’s opening League One match against MK Dons on Saturday has been suspended, the EFL has announced.“Following continued and comprehensive discussions with the ownership at Bury and other interested parties throughout Monday, the EFL Board is not satisfied it has received the necessary evidence in regard to the outstanding information it requires that demonstrates how the Club will be funded moving forwards.“As a result of not meeting Monday’s 5pm deadline, which had been extended on two previous occasions, the EFL Board feels it has been placed in an unenviable position and, regrettably, has opted to take the reluctant decision to suspend Saturday’s opening day fixture with MK Dons under the provision of EFL Regulation 28.2.“In addition, the EFL Board, if not in possession of the necessary evidence by 12pm on Friday 2 August 2019, will make a determination as to whether to suspend Bury’s away fixture at Accrington Stanley on Saturday 10 August 2019.”The EFL has been pressuring the club’s owner, Steve Dale, to provide evidence that he has the money to pay its substantial debts and ensure it is able to field a team.Earlier this month the EFL said Bury will start the season with a 12-point deduction after entering a company voluntary arrangement.The club, promoted last season, had a winding-up petition over unpaid debts adjourned at the high court in June and appeared to have secured their future with the CVA.The EFL insists it is continuing to support Bury but the club bought by Dale in December have to come up with the required paperwork.“As has been the case throughout this entire process, the EFL will continue to offer its full assistance to the ownership at Bury but remains clear that, while the league is here to support the club through some extremely complex and complicated issues, the outstanding matters can be resolved only with the cooperation from the club itself,” said the EFL statement.Bolton, who are awaiting completion of a takeover by the Football Ventures consortium, have escaped the ignominy of having their first fixture scrubbed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/106a53181aa7d086a7a1cc018a36cd14c3cd8f87/129_0_2305_1383/master/2305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9ddc14ff912fe9197ce6e162a174136","title":"indias strongman pm modi to appear on bear grylls man vs wild","story":"Narendra Modi claims the programme will showcase India’s ‘beautiful mountains and mighty rivers’, in the latest in a string of choreographed media appearancesIndia’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, will appear with Bear Grylls in a wilderness survival television programme, the latest in a series of Putin-style media appearances in which the 68-year-old leader projects himself as a man of action and a champion of the environment.A trailer for the programme, Man vs Wild, which will air in India on 12 August, shows the two men cutting through forests, sniffing animal dung and floating down a river on a makeshift raft.

He wants to have iconic status globally.”Promoting the trailer for the programme, Modi tweeted: “India – where you find lush green forests, erse wildlife, beautiful mountains and mighty rivers. Watching this programme will make you want to visit different parts of India and add to discourse of environmental conservation.”The programme previously caused controversy in India after the Indian Express reported that Modi was likely to have been filming with Bear Grylls on the day of a terror attack in the disputed region of Kashmir, when extremists from neighbouring Pakistan killed dozens of Indian armed security personnel and almost prompted military conflict.Some reports suggest Modi delayed taking action after the attack because he was in the wilderness filming with Grylls, but this has not been confirmed. “We know how important it was to him to feature in this show,” Mukhopadhyay said. The appearance with Bear Grylls will also bolster Modi’s image as a protector of India’s environment.Bhavreen Kandhari, an Extinction Rebellion activist in India, said Modi’s pro-business, pro-development government contributes to India’s environmental destruction. She ridiculed the UN’s decision to award Modi the title of Champion of the Earth in 2018. “I am standing in the most polluted city in the world,” she said, speaking over the phone from New Delhi.“My children’s lungs are black. There is no day when I don’t get calls about trees being cut down. There is absolute devastation.”Modi’s government has made international commitments to increasing India’s solar power production, but has also given the green light to controversial mining and infrastructure projects that will result in deforestation and environmental issues.In June, images from a giant landfill site went viral after it was reported that a mountain of garbage was set to climb higher than the Taj Mahal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa385bea765299e54eb4db88662c459596fc594/0_187_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d21773c3a9959dfb51516aab258fcaa1","title":"how we met she gave me what i call the electric hug i felt my hair stand up","story":"Kate Minchin, 44, a writer, and Sue Stark, 58, who works for a solar energy company, live in New York. They met on an all-women motorcycle trip‘We got to the front of the pack and sped off,” says Kate. She and Sue had reached the highest point on one of the highest motorable roads in the world, in the Ladakh region of northern India, and were alone for the first time. “It’s a tough bike ride to do – it’s not just a gravel path, they are like boulders,” says Kate. “So the adrenaline was flowing, but I was also chuffed because I was on my own with Sue. I was like a teenager.”They had met at a hotel in Delhi 10 days earlier, in July 2015, where nine of them had gathered for an all-women motorcycle trip. Neither made much of an impression on each other – they just got on with the trip, riding all day and meeting at hotels and camps in the evening. It was in Leh, northern India, where they had stopped for a couple of days before the final, highest leg of the journey, that Sue and Kate got talking. “We had more time to hang out, have a beer, get to know each other,” says Kate. “That was the point at which I started to think: ‘Oh bugger, I think I fancy her.’” She laughs. “Sue was adventurous, keen on biking, gorgeous. Also, she can be a bit of a tough cookie, initially, and I like a bit of a challenge. I found that mysterious and appealing. When we started chatting, she was great fun.”Sue hadn’t thought of Kate in that way, except to mention to a single friend on the trip that Kate was also single and attractive. “She is adventurous, travel-loving, smart, and she has that wonderful British wit,” says Sue, who is from the US. “And I thought she was cute.”Although it was romantic up there on that road alone – they slid down snowbanks and threw snowballs at each other – Kate didn’t make a move. “I knew Sue was single, but she hadn’t given any indicators that she was looking for anyone, or interested in me. We had started to get on really well, but I assumed that those feelings were one-sided – and if they weren’t going to be reciprocated, I didn’t want to risk spoiling the trip.”A few days later, everyone was hugging goodbye at the hotel in Delhi. Kate says: “I stood next to her thinking: ‘That can’t be the last hug – I need to do that again.’”Sue continues: “I was about to walk out the door and she comes back over and gives me what I call the electric hug. I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: ‘Did anyone see that?’ I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: ‘Oh my God, I think I’m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.’”Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling soon they were talking for several hours a day.In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. “We’d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,” says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling “was instant”, she says. Kate adds: “From that point on, it was perfect.” They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. “So we walked out to my car hand in hand,” Sue remembers. “And then I couldn’t wait any longer.”Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. “After two years, I needed to know what was happening,” says Sue. “We needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.”Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue’s adult daughter. They are planning lots more motorcycle adventures.Want to share your story?

If you’re laid-back by nature you tend to breeze through things. If you’re not, you should work at becoming more relaxed.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?How to ride a bike safely on the road. Conversely, drivers should know how to respect vulnerable road users.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’d spend more quality time with friends and family than working long hours.What do you wish children understood about adults?I wish they appreciated how hard it is to relate to them sometimes. It’s not their fault or ours, but you tend to lose touch with your childhood the older you get and it can become difficult to understand each other.What do you wish you’d known growing up?When you’re young you don’t have much confidence. I wish I’d realised that appearing to be confident often makes people take you more seriously. How you engage with people really makes a huge difference.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?If there’s something you want to do, don’t back out. People who are successful aren’t always the best at what they’re doing, they’re just the ones who push themselves. Don’t think about it, do it. It also helps to be optimistic and positive.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?I find anything to do with plumbing really complicated, but I recently learned how to bleed a radiator.

I treated education as a passive thing and assumed that other people who were clever were just naturally gifted – I didn’t appreciate the fact that you could educate and improve yourself.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?Smile, be helpful and think of others. Because, as they say, what goes around comes around.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?Everyone should be able to recite a poem or sing a song from memory.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’m contented to have got to where I am.

Here, she shares how she stays on top of money, the mortgage and managing billsRuth Young, 26, is a marketing manager in Newbury, Berkshire. She bought her first home, a two-bedroom apartment at Newbury racecourse, through the national shared ownership scheme just over a year ago.I have a relaxed, yet healthy, approach to money. I know when to treat myself and when to be more frivolous, but I also know what I can afford and when I should put the debit card away. It hasn’t always been this way. A few years ago I was scared to even look at my bank balance and would try to avoid it at all costs, until I decided to get on top of things. Just knowing what my bank balance was has made a big difference.Until I bought my own place, I was a commitment-phobe when it came to my living situation. I travelled for nearly two years, lived at home for a while, rented a room with an ex-boyfriend, then rented a lovely two-bedroom apartment with a friend for nine months – until she decided to move in with a partner. Rather than carry on renting, I finally plucked up the courage to try and get on the property ladder and discovered that there were some shared ownership apartments coming up on the development where we lived.Now, my main monthly outgoings are my mortgage (for half my home), rent (on the other half) and a service charge. Bills – such as electricity, heating and water – also take up a large proportion of my expenditure, which I manage and pay for myself. Properly managing bills was one of the many things I was nervous about when buying my property. I avoided it at first, but then I realised that the longer I left it, the more expensive they were getting. It’s best to set payment plans up as soon as you move in, to make sure that outgoings are manageable and even throughout the year.Because I live in a new-build house on a new development, I’m limited in the suppliers that I can choose for electricity and heating, but I always make sure I’m on the most cost-effective tariff available. After bills, my money goes towards things such as wifi, Netflix, Amazon Prime, petrol and my mobile phone. Eating out and Asos are my two biggest non-necessities.I use several apps to simplify my money. I used to work with clients in the fintech industry and would always try to keep on top of new finance apps. I set up a Monzo account as soon as I heard of it (who can resist a shiny new card where you can categorise spending with emojis?). But it was also great to track my spending by category, set up budgets in the app, track against these and to be able to change my pin and block my card instantly.I’ve also recently stopped doing a weekly food shop, to save money. I live alone and often spontaneously see friends, family, and my boyfriend throughout the week in the evenings, so I used to end up wasting food and money with a weekly shop. I now only buy food when I know I’m going to be eating at home, which actually saves me money. I can’t be trusted in the aisles of Tesco alone! However, years of living with my cost-conscious parents means I’m good at turning off the heating and lights whenever I leave the house. I also love my smart meter, which sits in my kitchen and not only tells me the time that I’m making a cuppa in the evening, but also how much I’ve spent that day on electricity. It’s usually a good sign that I need to get out of the house if it ever goes over £1 in a day! I also swear by Giffgaff to keep my phone costs down.Living on your own comes with pressures, and managing a house and the bills that are associated with it can feel daunting. But if you take them in manageable steps and keep on top of your bank balance with what’s available – or not! – it can actually be really enjoyable.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

Here, she shares their budgeting dos and dont’s …Full-time hospital catering assistant Rachael Howe, 31, and her boyfriend, Pete Walch, an industrial chemist, have been together for three years. They live in a terraced house in Bolton with Rachael’s rescue cat, Winston.Generally, I have a cautious approach to spending money. I’m fortunate that Pete earns more than the minimum wage, so on the occasions where we’re faced with an unexpected expense, he kindly helps out where he can. I wouldn’t say we have a particularly frugal lifestyle, but I definitely try to be careful.I attempt to simplify my money as much as possible. I have a mobile banking app, which I love because it means I know exactly what’s going on with my account at any time. I keep my statements paperless so I’m not sifting through papers to track down transactions and if I have any expenditure that I can’t set up a direct debit for, I’ll either schedule the payment through my banking app or set a reminder on my phone for 48 hours before the payment is due, to remind myself so that I can avoid any late fees.Our main outgoings are rent, utility bills and food. Pete also runs a car, so expenses such as fuel and car maintenance are a fairly regular outgoing for him. I also set myself a weekly budget.I keep track of the hours that I work, round my hourly wage down to the nearest pound to roughly compensate for national insurance and tax and take off the cost of my main outgoings – rent, utility bills, phone bill, etc – then ide my remaining total by the number of weeks between pay days to give myself a ballpark figure. I usually err on the side of caution and reduce the weekly amount by £10 to £20 to give myself some emergency funds in case I need them, and so that I can hopefully accumulate some savings.I find that taking the time to write outgoings down in a notebook gives me more of an incentive to stick to my budget. For some reason, just working them out on a calculator without writing it down just doesn’t stick with me as well.We have also had a smart meter fitted recently and we switched our gas and electricity supplier a few months back, having compared several companies to work out who provided the best value for money. Simple things, such as turning lights off and half-filling the kettle when you’re only making a couple of coffees, all add up to us having cheaper bills.I have a few other regular routines to help me save money. The first is that I always put any loose change – smaller than 50p – from my purse into a money box when I get home. We also check the reduced sections of the supermarket for items we can either put straight into the freezer or use towards making a large batch of something that we then split into portions and freeze for a later date. We always make a meal plan at the weekend for the following week, so we know exactly what food we need to buy. I think it’s important to make a list before you go food shopping as well, and try not to deviate from it. Local markets can be a great way of getting the right amount of fruit and vegetables for you, rather than buying pre-packaged foods from a supermarket which can cost more money or mean that you waste more food. Also, never go food shopping when you’re hungry!If I was to give any advice to young couples who are setting up home, it would be to always try to plan ahead. By planning your meals and other purchases, such as clothing and even entertainment, you can save a fortune. Try not to buy “bargains” on impulse if they aren’t something you’ll definitely use. Keep an eye on your favourite retailers’ websites to check for upcoming sales, and most cinemas, pub chains and other entertainment businesses have offers that can help save you cash, especially if you’re going out with friends.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose. I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister.”Campbell has been appealing against his expulsion since he was ejected under an automatic process designed to deal with those expressing support for another party. It caused mixed reactions at the time, with Charles Clarke, a former home secretary, revealing that he too had opted for the Lib Dems in the European elections because of their pro-remain policy, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, saying the move to kick out Campbell was “spiteful”.Others within Labour described the decision to expel Campbell as merely a matter of applying party rules consistently, while Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, celebrated his departure saying that “being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves” for his role in Blair’s government and the Iraq war.In his letter, Campbell said a member of Corbyn’s team had more recently suggested there could be two possible routes to him being let back into the party, one of which was a suspension of his auto-exclusion during a review of the party’s whole disciplinary system, and the other some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election.However, he said he felt unable to give a commitment to voting Labour while his concern about Corbyn’s stance on Brexit was “still acute”.“I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends,” he said, adding that this was not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision.“What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril,” he wrote. “To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause, though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters.”Corbyn said at the weekend he was “raring to go” and ready for an election against Johnson, which could come as early as this autumn if the EU is not open to changing the withdrawal agreement and parliament blocks a no-deal Brexit.Labour has changed its policy to call for a second referendum on any deal and to avoid no deal, but some Labour MPs are still pushing for a more unequivocally pro-remain position in all circumstances to head off the threat of the resurgent Lib Dems and win over anti-Brexit swing voters.Since Johnson came to power, his government has enjoyed a modest boost in the polls, with some putting the Conservatives neck-and-neck with Labour and others putting the Tories ahead.Campbell said he did not feel Corbyn’s shift towards supporting a second referendum went far enough, arguing: “Without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power.“With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election,. If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you.“I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.”Labour had no comment on Campbell’s letter. It comes after Peter Mandelson, another former Labour strategist under Blair, gave an interview over the weekend calling for a new party leader, although he said he would not leave the party.“We are now in a situation where many people will react with horror against what Johnson plans to do – defying parliament to take Britain out of the EU without a deal to safeguard our trade and jobs – but have no faith in Corbyn’s desire or ability to block this,” Mandelson told Alain Elkann for La Stampa and other European newspapers.“Corbyn is not the leader that Labour needs at this time. He cannot deliver. Even his supporters are realising this. We need an alternative who can stand up to Johnson and lead the country against the disaster which is in the making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18a3571b392c8e2922d781c0d970cf24488485e0/0_158_2732_1639/master/2732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4e99d0d999ebea490afc4ff10867434","title":"eu officials reject dominic raabs easier no deal brexit claim","story":"Brussels sources fear UK crashing out would trigger acrimonious blame gameEuropean Union officials have rejected Dominic Raab’s claim that negotiating a free-trade deal would be “much easier” after a no-deal Brexit.While the foreign secretary contends that leaving the EU without an agreement would ease the way to solving the disputed Irish border question, European sources fear a no-deal Brexit would trigger an acrimonious blame game.“It would mean the complete breakdown of political relations and I don’t think there would be much trust on the EU side with the Tories, or with the prime minister,” a senior diplomat said.“Eventually we would get around it because we are pragmatic, but this would be really, really bad, because of all the rhetoric around blaming.”A second diplomat, speaking before Raab’s intervention, argued that all contact would cease after a no-deal Brexit. “Our phones will not be connected at that time … I don’t think they will be connected to someone who has reneged on their obligations,” they said.European officials agree that a precondition of talks would be a British pledge to honour the three core parts of the withdrawal agreement – citizens’ rights, the Irish border and the financial settlement.At the weekend, the EU budget commissioner, Günther Oettinger, told Der Tagesspiegel the UK’s credit rating would be hit if Boris Johnson carried out his threat not to honour payments promised to the EU.Tanja Fajon, the Social Democrat member of the European parliament’s foreign affairs committee, said: “To negotiate a free trade agreement usually takes years and I believe the UK doesn’t have that time after a no-deal Brexit.”Fajon was citing an unofficial, outdated Brussels estimate of the Brexit bill, which is much higher than the €39bn the British government has calculated.In reality, both figures need to be adjusted because of the UK’s delayed departure. As an EU member state, the UK continues to make contributions to the EU budget, lowering the final “Brexit bill”, which is based on honouring commitments until 2021.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Raab said both sides needed to be flexible, while giving no hint of compromise from the government. He said it would be much easier to deal with the Irish backstop through a free-trade agreement once the UK was no longer subject to “the demands and unilateral dictates of the EU” as a member of the the bloc.The EU has ruled out reopening the deal agreed with Theresa May, including the British-designed backstop, which is seen in Brussels as a major concession to the UK.Brussels sources hope soft-Brexit Tories will prevent the UK leaving without a deal, but think the EU has no choice but to stick to its strategywhen faced with “impossible demands” from London.Johnson was “playing in the casino”, said the senior diplomat, who argued that the Brexit process, from David Cameron’s referendum to Johnson’s no-deal pledge, was an attempt for Conservative party unity. “How can you negotiate with a partner who has just proven that he is completely irrational and just willing to destroy things to keep his party completely united?” the diplomat said.After the weekend media blitz from Johnson’s ministers on no-deal planning, a European commission spokesman reiterated that the EU would defend its own interests.“The UK preparedness is not for us to deal with. Our no-deal preparedness protects the EU and our interests in the case of a no-deal Brexit. A no-deal scenario is not our preferred outcome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec9e6464b8f367655d0fa7cfcc75fd8e7b37053/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900d47fb96c9e2bca14984fea8791696","title":"lib dems quiet bollocks to brexit brecon and radnorshire byelection","story":"Party is hoping a byelection win in leave constituency can kickstart its Westminster revivalIt may seem odd to omit what has become the Lib Dems’ defining selling point from the literature of its candidate, Jane Dodds, though in between pledging investment in health and social care and delivering for farmers, she promises to “fix our broken and ided politics” – code for disillusion with the major parties and the failure of Westminster to break the Brexit impasse.Dodds is cautious in the way she talks to voters about Brexit, restricting herself to discussing the perils of no deal and its effect on the constituency’s sheep farming and automotive workers, though she says the party’s stance is hardly a secret.Unlike many MPs, and some of the activists who have come to the constituency to campaign, hoping to help stop Brexit, she says the 2016 referendum made her resolve to listen more.“The referendum result was a shock, it made me think more than anything though that we need to get out more and talk to more people,” says Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats.In Brecon and Radnorshire, she says she has found a deep disconnect between its inhabitants and Westminster politics, often a physical one because of a loss of local services and frustration with issues such as broadband infrastructure. No deal will “potentially decimate” sheep farming, the economic and cultural lifeblood of many communities, she says.“The first thing that I’m clear about is that a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table,” says Dodds, drinking coffee in the sunshine in Crickhowell before a day of canvassing. “But beyond that, people do know what the Lib Dem position is, though – we aren’t dishonest about that – and they know we are a remain party who will campaign for a ‘people’s vote’.”Though Dodds is keen to keep issues local, the vote on Thursday will have huge national significance. Chris Davies, the ousted Conservative MP convicted of expenses fraud, is fighting again for the seat after a byelection was triggered by a recall petition.Should Dodds win, the Conservative majority will dwindle to just one seat, just a week after Boris Johnson was installed as prime minister. Conservative campaigning has been low key, though Johnson is scheduled to visit on Tuesday. There are some nerves about a “Boris bounce”, but Lib Dems are outwardly confident of taking the seat, believing that Davies’ reselection as a candidate is a sign that CCHQ wants a convenient excuse for a loss. The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split.Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep. For him, a no-deal Brexit would be personal, though he is wary about stopping Brexit entirely. “I’ve always believed it was better to stay in and particularly for my business it would be catastrophic if we had no deal,” he tells Dodds. “The extra taxes make a huge difference to the margins of the business. But I do believe we need to respect democracy and people voted to come out. I don’t know if they ever realised the implications, that’s the thing.”Antonia Harrison, an activist who travelled from Portsmouth to campaign, has had to temper her pro-European enthusiasm when speaking to voters. “I’m a European first and foremost: it’s my identity, it made me determined to try and stop this,” she says. “But it is different here, I find a lot of people are saying they voted to leave. Some have said they would vote Lib Dem but because they voted leave, then they can’t this time.”One of the biggest challenges is getting around a constituency the size of Luxembourg mostly crossed by winding country lanes. Dodds says she is walking about 20km a day and driving between districts as much as three hours apart. On election day, activists will need to cover a huge area as turnout could make the difference.The Lib Dems have attracted campaigners from across the UK, as well as two who have flown over from Hong Kong and Toronto. Local organisers claim volunteers include former Tory members from London and current Labour members.On Crickhowell’s high street, opinion is ided. Robin Masefield, 33, the owner of Natural Weigh, which sells food and household products without packaging, is keen for a Dodds victory. “I hope she gets it, I just don’t support the Conservatives’ political views whatsoever,” he says. “Boris is a character, there’s no doubt about that but I do think he is likely to keep his promises. I think he’s for us: Britain will come first.”Many residents are amused, more than anything else, that the media circus is now making its way to Brecon. Marianne, a pensioner travelling down Crickhowell high street, said she had been surprised to find the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron ringing her doorbell. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Though it is local issues that will affect her vote, she says many people have found Davies to be personable and effective. “Local people are so fed up about Brexit I think they won’t want to think about it and will vote for whoever they would usually vote for. It is local things that matter more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6267b913b2b60563707fbb38990e6e5633c7c97c/0_288_5048_3028/master/5048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66c40d040dd651b596e3d2b3f4b0df3","title":"they could end up kingmakers again readers on future liberal democrats","story":"Readers share their hopes for a new movement in the UK, while others can’t forget the party’s part in austerity in the coalitionA week on from Jo Swinson’s election as leader of the Liberal Democrats, we asked readers to share their views on the future of the party.People from across the UK told of their hopes for the party under its new leader and the strength of the Lib Dems’ clear anti-Brexit line. While many readers were hopeful for an invigorated movement, others can’t forget the party’s involvement in the coalition and its support for austerity and other policies when in government. Below is a selection of your views.The Lib Dems are in the most promising position they have been in years, but they’ll have to resist the urge to rely on their anti-Brexit USP to win back disaffected ex-voters like myself. I would have to see a huge white flag in respect of their role in austerity, and a comprehensive set of ambitious policies to address inequality and environmental catastrophe. I switched my vote to Labour after the Lib Dems seemed to drink too much of the neoliberalausterity Kool-Aid in coalition with the Conservatives.Jo Swinson has energy, youthfulness and goodwill in her favour. She does not have a convincing record of progressive voting. I’d be willing to let sleeping dogs lie with regards to the coalition missteps if they come out strongly in favour of truly progressive economic and environmental policies. James, 27, LondonI was a paid-up member of the party from 2010-2017 but couldn’t vote for Tim Farron due to his equivocation over gay sex as a sin. Jo Swinson is a brilliant force for change. She’s intelligent, articulate and experienced for someone who’s yet to turn 40. She will challenge both Boris Johnson’s bluffing buffoonery and Jeremy Corbyn’s hard-left idealism. With her at the helm there is genuine hope for a new liberal movement to rise again in the UK. For a younger woman to strike out and offer a new path to follow will give great success to the party, as it did in New Zealand with Jacinda Ardern and in New York with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. These people are the caring future of our politics and I’ve no doubt Swinson will quickly develop a larger supporter base in the UK. Tom Williams, 41, LeicesterSwinson’s voting record is far too problematic for me ever to consider voting Lib Dem again. I regard the Lib Dems as Jekyll to the Tories’ Hyde. By becoming a single-issue “stop Brexit” party, they risk consigning themselves to irrelevance once again, since it’s highly unlikely that Johnson will call another referendum or unilaterally revoke article 50. A shift towards the Greens might be helpful, but I can’t see Swinson being too enthusiastic about that given her voting record. There’s a reason why she’s publicly courting disenchanted Tories they have very similar politics and ideology. Chris Hughes, 41, East AngliaI still have a lingering feeling of betrayal after their actions in the coalition government. As a regular undecided voter however, many of their policies meet my desires. Remain, support for education, higher taxes to pay for public services. I don’t feel I can vote Labour under Corbyn, so it’s Lib Dem or Green now. Fingers crossed Swinson can start to make me believe again. They need to remain a strong voice for a second referendum, but also ensure they have believable policies in other areas too. I suspect they will end up kingmakers again, let’s hope they act with more integrity next time. Andrea Hales, 44, WorcestershireIt’s about time we forgave them their errors in coalition. It’s not as if the Conservatives or Labour have not broken promises or made a total hash of stuff in the past. They are the only middle ground party and the only ones committed to electoral reform. I would personally vote Green but the only way to do that effectively is to edge towards PR. They need to hold the balance of power at the very least. Currently there is no effective opposition to anything. Steve, 61, KentI think the party has been unfairly punished for the worst decisions of the coalition. I hope that the party can be a beacon of hope in a world of increasingly extremist and uninformed views. I hope the party will be able to capitalise on the anti-Brexit feeling among large parts of the population and lead through the middle, growing its support base and number of MPs in any future election. I voted for Swinson because she is young, fresh, passionate, intelligent, articulate and speaks with authority on a range of topics. I think she can lead the party out of its recent difficult past. Fiona Sweetman, 53, CarlisleI think there is a huge chasm in politics at the moment and I feel there is great potential for the Liberal Democrats to fill that void. However, splitting the vote of remain-leaning or left-leaning parties is a problem. The Lib Dems need to manage their image and not be seen as a dumping ground for washed-up Tories and Blairites. I hope I am not alone in my belief that most who are anti-Brexit or centre-left see the benefit of the Lib Dems attracting votes that would otherwise go to the Conservatives. I feel the best hope for the party (and country) is to force a coalition government with Labour. Rob, 26, West MidlandsWhile I understand Brexit is the defining issue of our age, it cannot be a one-issue party. In the short term this may win it some success, but there needs to be longer-term policy planning and a seismic shift in how it projects itself and how it is perceived for it to remain a lasting political force.I was pleased by Jo Swinson’s election as leader in spite of her role in enabling Conservative austerity during the coalition government. But I was disconcerted by her statements in the press saying that she would rule out a Lib Dem pact with Labour under  Corbyn. Who is she appealing to by making this assertion? By denouncing Corbyn’s Labour, Swinson is effectively alienating millions of young voters who swung to Labour in 2017 because of Corbyn and because of his engaging social democratic brand of politics.

During an interview on BBC’s Today programme, he seemed to say the 2016 referendum result gave a mandate for a no-deal Brexit.In a testy exchange, he insisted it was made “clear” by “those on the campaign” that “we should strive for a good deal, but if that wasn’t available that we should go on and make a success of Brexit”.When repeatedly challenged on Monday about the claim and asked to provide proof, he added: “I was questioned on it by the BBC almost every time I appeared and so was Michael Gove.”Raab’s comments provoked the People’s Vote campaign to accuse him of trying to rewrite history. It said: “The reality is that neither the official Vote Leave campaign or any of its prominent spokespeople – including Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab – promised anything other than a deal with Europe and a continuation of free trade.”As the country heads towards the 31 October deadline, the  has analysed the previous stated positions of some of the key players in the Vote Leave camp.Most, including Boris Johnson, focused on the ease with which the UK would get a free trade deal.Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote, Raab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics: “We’re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we’d cut a very good deal and it’s certainly not in the European’s interests to erect trade barriers.”During an appearance on the BBC’s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: “The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.”In March 2017, Raab wrote in the : “If there’s no deal within two years, it won’t be for lack of an ambitious UK offer. It would represent the triumph of the EU’s rather inward-looking politics over the reality of the outside world. That would be a shame, but only serve to vindicate Britain’s decision to leave.”Invited to provide evidence for Raab’s comments to the BBC, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “This is not for the civil service to answer.”Johnson told the Treasury select committee in March 2016: “Our relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn’t seem to me to be very hard … to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.”Speaking at a Vote Leave event in March 2016, Johnson said: “I put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.”He sought to reassure remain voters that the UK would still have access to the single market: “EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected, and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU. British people will still be able to go and work in the EU to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down,” he said. “The only change – and it will not come in any great rush – is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation.”Johnson, then foreign secretary, told the House of Commons in July 2017: “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”In April 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. “Outside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,” he said. “But we wouldn’t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy £600m every week.”Responding to the Office for National Statistics’ trade figures in March 2016, Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, said: “It’s clear the trade deck is stacked in the UK’s favour. EU trade is shrinking yet we are held back from striking deals with emerging markets as we’ve given up control to Brussels. The real question should be why our EU neighbours wouldn’t be clambering over themselves to secure a free trade deal with their biggest market.”And in response to a report by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on the economic consequences of Brexit in April 2016, Vote Leave issued a press release with an accompanying note criticising the “flawed assumption” that the UK would not do a free trade deal with the EU after Brexit.It read: “The OECD states that: ‘trade with the EU and other countries would initially revert to a WTO MFN-basis’. This is a highly flawed assumption that not even the IN campaign seriously contemplates as a realistic possibility. Leading pro-EU campaigners have admitted the UK will strike a free trade agreement if we Vote Leave.”After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary Liam Fox said: “The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a317c233bd45c2338e4655dccc0c441c5a8dcbf/0_356_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2142d6ea2149133efbbb51447f81c8","title":"houdini brailsford durability scepticism","story":"On a corner of the Place de la Concorde on Sunday night Michal Kwiatkowski dropped his bike, sat down on the cobblestones and tucked into hot pizza and cold beer.The former world champion, also winner of the Milan-San Remo and the Amstel Gold Race, went unnoticed as jubilant Colombian fans swarmed around the Ineos team’s bus and gazed adoringly at his teammate Egan Bernal as he waved from the top step of the podium on the Champs Élysées.Watching on, the team’s billionaire owner, Jim Ratcliffe, could enjoy the first fruits of his £40m investment in cycling, only four months after Team Ineos had been created. It had been a gamble worth taking.Ratcliffe and the Ineos team principal, Dave Brailsford, are kindred spirits, both knights of the realm, both maligned by the media, both questioned by the establishment over their ethics and both pursued by an army of trolls and sceptics.Brailsford has become the Houdini of cycling. Little more than a year ago, after a damning report by the DCMS openly questioned his credibility, his stock had fallen so low this newspaper described his promise to win the Tour de France clean as “an empty pledge”, while others called for his resignation and the revoking of his knighthood. Undaunted, he has ploughed on regardless. Brailsford now seems to accept that haters gonna hate, whether you win or lose.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSeven Tour wins in eight years, with four different riders, would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago, when Team Sky first rocked up at the Tour de France. Now a Brailsford-led Tour success is almost regarded as routine and, as the 2019 Tour ended, Bernal’s victory barely raised eyebrows. It is almost as if Jiffy bags, salbutamol investigations and mystery testosterone deliveries never existed.Holding court in a Colombian football jersey in the Parisian dusk, Brailsford was bullish. “Tough times don’t last,” he said, “but tough people do. You can’t do this job without a thick skin. In sports management you need to be resilient and decide what’s important to you and what you are prepared to take on board. It takes me back to my upbringing in a Welsh slate mining village. They were tough guys, those miners, and you learn good values from them which have stood me in good stead.”His latest Tour win may be seen by some as payback for all the criticism but Brailsford dismissed the suggestion that he had been vindicated. “I got to the point where I felt life is for looking forward. You can look back and be angry or bitter but leading a group of other people to achieve something is a much happier place to be.“During the Tour last year I was angry. I felt like I was in a fight the whole time, I was stewing. Maybe age helps but this year I’ve felt a lot calmer: I don’t feel any less competitive but I’ve been a bit more measured and I’ve stopped fighting everybody.“You get some people in life who are haters. They will find something to hate all the time. But if you look at the successful people in life, they are not the haters. If you want to be a winner, hating is not the way to operate, to go about it.”He may insist that Ineos remains a British team at heart but the next generation of Grand Tour winners churned out by Brailsford are more likely to come from Colombia or Ecuador, than Kilburn or Cardiff.“When we started the team, there was a very Anglo-Saxon way about it,” he said. “You are going to do it our way, no debate about it, which is naive when you have Colombians and Spanish staff in the team.“The best way to do it is to understand other people’s culture, other people’s views and make them feel comfortable and help them perform to the best of their ability.”Brailsford said that his youthful experiences of trying to break into European cycling have given him an insight into Bernal’s needs. “When I was young and I came to live in France it was the loneliest period of my life. I had made a commitment to come here and I dared not go back as a failure, even though I was hating it.“I was really lonely and I realised I had to learn French and talk to somebody. Very slowly I integrated into the French culture. That experience stuck with me.”But while the 22-year-old Bernal has quickly established himself as the hottest property in the sport and the future face of Ineos, the sands of time are catching up with Geraint Thomas. After four crashes in a month, a crammed build-up and a lack of racing miles, the Welshman endured a bitter-sweet Tour.He was gracious in defeat but privately he was said to be distraught at his second place. In the context of his season finishing the runner-up to his teammate was no mean feat but he wore the expression of a man who realised he had missed his last opportunity.Yet for all Brailsford’s defiance, Thomas’s graciousness and Bernal’s wide-eyed wonder, the 2019 Tour will be remembered as a Tour à l’ancienne, when risk, flair and panache, personified by Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, returned to the biggest race in cycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/715fa058798abec2ef97a4f846b2d4290d3810f5/0_178_4957_2975/master/4957.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24c96c09f3fd6cc9b7d28e64549ee2f1","title":"mercedes hockenheim period drama lewis hamilton","story":"Instead of some perfect PR, Mercedes marked GP No 200 as a constructor with their own hellish episode of Black MirrorThere was a distinctive air of pageant around Mercedes at the German Grand Prix on Sunday. With Hockenheim their stage, the team were determined to mark their home race with a flourish. They had made an admirable effort to ensure it was memorable and it was. Yet few will remember their attempt to bring a sense of racing’s history to the grid but rather their very public failure in Formula One’s here and now, an event made all the more striking by its rarity.Mercedes were celebrating their 200th grand prix as a constructor at what will probably be their last home race for some time because Hockenheim is highly unlikely to be on the F1 calendar next year. They were running a new white livery to celebrate 125 years of motor racing. The white gave way to the traditional silver at the rear of the car in homage to the legend that the team had scraped off the white paint to save weight from their car in 1934 – the birth of the Silver Arrows.Equally striking was the decision for the entire team to dress in period costume to mark their first Formula One entry in 1954. Here then were mechanics in white boiler suits and flat caps, the team principal,Toto Wolff, in braces and a fedora, indeed the entire organisation decked out by London’s Angels Costumes, the supplier of choice for the film industry.Had things gone to plan it would have been the perfect piece of PR to accompany their decision to allow Netflix to film them for the new series of its F1 documentary – access that they had not allowed last season. Only instead of an old-fashioned drama with a happy ending Mercedes found themselves in their own hellish episode of Black Mirror.Max Verstappen won in Germany, a fine drive for Red Bull Mercedes were riveting for all the wrong reasons. Lewis Hamilton finished 11th on the track. He had led the race but went off being given slick tyres just as the rain returned. It precipitated an unplanned pit stop at which the team had neither a new front wing nor tyres ready. Insult to injury followed as the team failed to pit him under a late safety car, fearful of losing track position.These were unprecedented operational problems. Then, as if to heighten the sense of distorted reality in Baden-Württemberg, Hamilton – the team’s rock, their five-times world champion whose driving has been defined by metronomic, ruthless, precision execution – spun off and almost binned his car at turn one.Shortly afterwards Valtteri Bottas did the same at the same corner and ended in the wall. Day done, neither driver was in the top 10 on the track and the lighthearted outfits stood in stark contrast to the ashen-faced grimaces of the team. Hamilton, it was later revealed, had been so disillusioned with 11 laps to go that he had urged the team over the radio to retire the car.Wolff, usually congenial and witty even in adversity, appeared almost shell-shocked and admitted that perhaps Mercedes had wanted too much from Germany. “I do believe in karma,” he said. “When you want to do particularly well things can go wrong, maybe you get distracted and maybe you are doing things differently to how you would normally do.”There have been accusations of arrogance levelled at Mercedes, that their elaborate plans were predicated on expectations of another win to add to the nine they had already taken this season. This is unfair. Given their performances thus far they had every right to expect to be strong at Hockenheim and should be applauded for their initiative in bringing fun and innovation to the grid.Whether it all proved a distraction will be a subject the team will investigate fully but it seems this was simply a bad day at the office, one which spiralled out of control. Hamilton referred to a domino effect after the decision to send him out on slicks.It was to be fair a 50-50 decision other teams had done the same in conditions that were devilishly difficult to call. The pit stop that followed Hamilton’s off was unplanned, unexpected and unsurprisingly chaotic. The team were not culpable but they were for that final decision not to pit, a misjudgment in a moment of pure pressure where their process was found wanting.It was a pressure to which they have been subjected infrequently over the past five years their dominance has only rarely been challenged and it raises the intriguing question of just how well the team might perform were they regularly in a tooth-and-nail scrap or on the back foot.Neither is likely to be the case for the rest of the season. Other teams know the Mercedes juggernaut will not be remotely impeded by these events. In the past they have emerged from adversity stronger. Yet this is not the way the team want to go forward and, with Germany consigned to the dustbin of history, clearly some very blunt talking will define their immediate future.Wolff said: “You never go home and say: ‘Why didn’t we win?’ You say: ‘Why did we lose?’ This is going to be the discussion we are going to have.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69156c9a7bcd947e6582e8156ccda4890a56a05e/395_179_3344_2006/master/3344.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a860f62e2fad2c13e021612ef97b639","title":"tour de france egan bernal","story":"The most meaningful touch of the 2019 Tour de France was not the slap Luke Rowe gave Tony Martin after the German had tried to run him into the gutter, leading to the expulsion of both riders from the race. It was the touch of hands between Julian Alaphilippe and Egan Bernal as they rode in the peloton towards Paris, a salute from the man who had brought the race to life to the one who was about to take the spoils: a moment summing up a race that, over the course of three weeks, had rekindled old enthusiasms and enraptured new audiences.What, someone had asked me as I sat glued to the TV one afternoon in the middle week of the race, do you see in this? I tried to explain how a three-week Grand Tour resembles cricket in its prolonged complexity but with one big difference: imagine a five-day Test, a 50-over one-day match and a Twenty20 game being played simultaneously, with all the different priorities, internal rhythms and contrasting techniques superimposed on each other. And, again as with cricket, the elements play a vital role in ways that are often hard to predict.Certainly no one had envisaged the storm that cut short last Friday’s stage to Tignes, in which all the narrative strands had been set to explode at once. But, having begun with one set of tears as a torn thigh muscle forced the great French hope Thibaut Pinot to abandon the race in distress, it ended with another as Bernal tried to hide his face from the TV camera after removing the yellow jersey from the shoulders of Alaphilippe, France’s other darling.The hailstones and the mudslide that halted the race after the riders had crested the giant Col d’Iseran led many to express their disappointment that the promised showdown had been distorted by circumstances outside the riders’ control but really this was just the Tour being the Tour: the riders are pitting themselves against the elements – mountains formed by volcanic eruptions millions of years ago and the weather systems of a large country – and sometimes the elements answer back.As this year’s highest point, the Iseran was dedicated to Henri Desgrange, the founder of the race, who saw his creation as an ordeal from which only the strongest would emerge. How would he have reacted? Probably by expecting the riders to wade through the flood and clamber over the mudslide before setting off on the final climb. No such option was available to Christian Prudhomme, his current successor, as the riders raced down towards a series of potentially lethal hazards under the eyes of the worldwide TV audience. If Bernal was the beneficiary, then it was a reward for seizing the initiative in the Iseran’s final kilometres.Two days later, as the 155 survivors rode up the Champs Élysées into a golden sunset, the former pro David Millar watched from his TV commentary position and mused on the arrival of a new generation. “You feel like something’s happening,” he said. But he wasn’t just welcoming the youngest champion since François Faber in 1909. He meant the feeling that this Tour had been characterised by an approach based on risk-taking and inventiveness, a philosophy embodied by the flair and volonté of Alaphilippe, who had worn the leader’s jersey for 14 days and engaged the affections of spectators around the world before weakening and dropping to fifth place during the final two days in the Alps.Down at the finish line, Dave Brailsford was stamping on any such suggestion. As he basked in a second one-two finish for riders under his command, the Team Ineos chief expressed a sincere admiration of Alaphilippe and Pinot, who between them had raised hopes of a long-awaited home victory. But his verdict was unequivocal. In the end, he said, “strategy paid out over chaos, and teamwork paid out over iniduals”.While some may prefer chaos, Bernal’s personality made the outcome acceptable even to those who had dreaded yet another crushing demonstration of Brailsford-inspired teamwork. Who could not fail to warm to a young Colombian who arrived in Europe only three years ago but was able to make his podium speech in Paris, without notes, in English, Italian and French as well as his native Spanish, and with such evident modesty?Two days earlier, having just assumed the race leadership, he had been asked about the pressure of wearing the yellow jersey on behalf of a whole cycling-mad nation. “It’s strange,” he said, “because I don’t feel pressure. I really love to ride the bike. I enjoy the race. I enjoy to be fighting with these guys, the adrenaline, you know – to wait, wait, wait, then attack and go full gas. For some it’s a lot of suffering but I love it. It’s not a space for pressure.”The sight of a proper flyweight climber winning the Tour de France – in the tradition of Charly Gaul and Marco Pantani – was a rare treat, while the race’s complexity made room for great inidual feats by the breakaway specialist Thomas De Gendt, the sprinter Caleb Ewan and two other climbers, Simon Yates and Vincenzo Nibali, the latter the 2014 winner whose victory in the final mountain stage revealed another facet of the race: that three weeks is long enough to ride yourself out of a spell of poor form and to regain self-respect.Whether this was or was not the best Tour de France in history, or whether a great denouement was ruined by the weather, is beside the point. In all of sport, there is no human spectacle like it. And this was the most gloriously human Tour of all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b457811d9fdec7106729ccdd7d36c3c2f0f3f43/0_181_2334_1400/master/2334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b672b60d0852f3a74e9593fcab2ced23","title":"james mcavoy to star as cyrano de bergerac in west end of london","story":"Production will be part of season providing free tickets to first-time theatre-goersJames McAvoy is returning to the West End of London as Cyrano de Bergerac, the opening play of a season offering 15,000 free tickets to first-time theatre-goers.Key workers, under 30s and people receiving benefits will also be targeted with an offer of 15,000 tickets at £15, as a way of encouraging new audiences.The initiatives were announced by the theatre director Jamie Lloyd, returning to the West End to collaborate again with McAvoy, an actor he previously directed in Macbeth and The Ruling Class at Trafalgar Studios.The new show is a version of Edmond Rostand’s 1897 comedy, freely adapted by the playwright Martin Crimp.Lloyd has been a leading voice stressing the importance of ersifying audiences for commercial theatre and has spoken out against the high cost of tickets.He said: “Every day, we talk about making theatre more accessible to absolutely everyone, but, inspired by free museum and gallery entry, I believe that true and meaningful access actually means free tickets. I hope that this inspires other theatre companies and producers to investigate similar schemes in the future, changing the landscape of West End theatre forever.”The initiative is backed by the Ambassador Theatre Group and British Airways.Cyrano de Bergerac tells the story of a soldier and lovelorn poet who falls for the beautiful Roxanne but fears his big nose will stop him finding happiness.McAvoy had revealed that the project was on the cards as long ago as September 2017, when he posted a picture on Instagram of him carefully reading the script, his head shaved for the latest X-Men film but with him wearing a false nose. He wrote that Crimp “has done a brilliantly accessible, fun and emotionally powerful adaptation. I’m excited that my considerable conk is gonna get some serious augmentation.”The play will be the opening production in a new Lloyd season at the Playhouse theatre from November 2019. The season will run until August 2020, with further shows yet to be announced.Lloyd said he could not wait to get back in the rehearsal room with McAvoy, “who shares my commitment to accessibility in the arts”.The director, who last year curated a six-month season showing all of Harold Pinter’s short plays, has been a withering critic of West End producers charging too much, particularly when celebrity actors are cast.He told the Stage in 2016: “There are a lot of companies and producers out there who will … effectively exploit the profile of actors in a show by charging tickets that are soaring way past the £100 mark, which I think is outrageous. If you have a big house, and if you’ve got a lot of seats, then your tickets should come down, they should not go up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/539083cb3ebb9bf8e05402fc021563e2d053434c/34_0_3433_2060/master/3433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e0d5e11354839eeb1e5fe6e7ff58749","title":"tories facebook ads bugs transparency dark money","story":"Tools to crack down on ‘dark money’ political ads are ineffective, researchers say“Major bugs” in Facebook’s political transparency tools are preventing researchers and journalists from holding advertisers to account, according to a report from Mozilla.It comes as the Conservative party is spending thousands of pounds a day experimenting with new adverts on the social network, prominently emphasising the leadership of Boris Johnson.Although the party’s spending habits are ostensibly disclosed by the social network, in practice it is hard to uncover specific details because of flaws identified by researchers at Mozilla, the non-profit foundation behind the Firefox browser.Launched in the UK in 2018, the Facebook ad library is a public record of all the adverts related to social issues, elections or politics that have been posted on the site. In March, the social network launched an API – an application programming interface, or set of protocols – for the library, intended to let researchers perform complex analysis on the information contained within.Instead, researchers found a series of bugs and design flaws that hampered any serious attempt to hold advertisers to account. “Once our technical experts began working with the API we quickly concluded it was unusable,” the foundation said.“Through a month of rigorous testing we uncovered 12 major bugs, that plagued the tool and were reported to Facebook.“Targeting information was not available, bulk data access was not offered, and the data wasn’t tagged properly. In fact, no search was alike. Repeating an identical search would produce wildly differing results. The state of the API made it nearly impossible to extract the data needed for researchers and journalists to ‘analyse ads’ as Facebook had claimed.”Those flaws greatly limit the amount of information available about political advertisers on the social network. For instance, Facebook publishes a daily report about spending on the site, which reveals that the Conservative party spent £4,003 on 27 July, the most recent date for which data is available, and £13,487 during the previous week.The spending is enough to make the party the second-largest political advertiser on Facebook, after the beer industry’s campaign to cut alcohol duty.But because the Conservatives are testing a new message, and a new leader, they far outrank other advertisers in terms of the number of unique ads: in just one day, the party posted more than 600 unique variations of adverts, according to Facebook’s daily reporting. Each inidual advert had less than £100 spent on it, and received fewer than 1,000 views, but in total, the adverts will have been shown to many thousands of recipients, providing valuable information for the party about which messages resonate well with various audiences.“The ads are a bit of a mixed bag in terms of what they’re trying to get people to do,” said the online advertising campaign group Who Targets Me. “On one hand, they’re video ads designed to persuade and motivate. But at the same time you’re also asked to click through and fill out a survey.Who Targets Me reported that the party’s spending had doubled in two days, from £2,000 on 25 July to £4,000 on 27 July. But to do so, the group had to keep its own offline records of advertising spending, since Facebook does not offer researchers historical data.In response to queries about the bugs in its transparency tools, Facebook told the New York Times: “We were the first to introduce this level of ads transparency, and it remains a priority.” A spokesperson said the company “continually seeks feedback from researchers and journalists”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ed88438c0cfea76d1826671f81d7e01513fa3a2/1_0_6154_3694/master/6154.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4373a5a8aa7174252a218057b05f03a5","title":"what is facial recognition and how sinister is it","story":"As a surveillance technique it’s ubiquitous, but is still a political, legal and ethical conundrumFacial recognition technology has spread prodigiously. It’s there on Facebook, tagging photos from the class reunion, your cousin’s wedding and the office summer party. Google, Microsoft, Apple and others have built it into apps to compile albums of people who hang out together.It verifies who you are at airports and is the latest biometric to unlock your mobile phone where facial recognition apps abound. Need to confirm your identity for a £1,000 bank transfer? Just look into the camera.New applications crop up all the time. Want to know who’s at the door? A video doorbell with facial recognition will tell you, provided you’ve uploaded a photo of the person’s face. Other systems are used to spot missing persons and catch slackers who lie about the hours they spend in the office. Advertisers, of course, are in on the act. Thanks to facial recognition, billboards can now serve up ads based on an estimate of your sex, age and mood.Sometimes, yes. China uses facial recognition for racial profiling and its tracking and control of the Uighur muslims has been roundly condemned as a shameful first for a government.Its cameras also spot and fine jaywalkers, verify students at school gates, and monitor their expressions in lessons to ensure they are paying attention.Russia has embraced the technology too. In Moscow, video cameras scan the streets for “people of interest” and plans have been mooted to equip the police with glasses that work the same way.There have been reports that Israel is using facial recognition for covert tracking of Palestinians deep inside the West Bank. Meanwhile in Britain, the politan and South Wales police forces have trialled facial recognition to find people in football and rugby crowds, on city streets, and at commemorations and music festivals. Taylor Swift even installed the tech at a gig in California to weed out stalkers.Shops are increasingly installing the technology to deter and catch thieves. Next year, it will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo.Advances in three technical fields have played a major part: big data, deep convolutional neural networks and powerful graphics processing units or GPUs.Thanks to Flickr, Instagram, Facebook, Google and others, the internet holds billions of photos of people’s faces which have been scraped together into massive image datasets. They are used to train deep neural networks, a mainstay of modern artificial intelligence, to detect and recognise faces. The computational grunt work is often done on GPUs, the superfast chips that are dedicated to graphics processing. But there is more to it than flashy new technology. Over the past decade in particular, facial recognition systems have been deployed all over the place, and the data gathered from them has helped companies hone their technology.First off, the computer has to learn what a face is. This can be done by training an algorithm, usually a deep neural network, on a vast number of photos that have faces in known positions. Each time the algorithm is presented with an image, it estimates where the face is. The network will be rubbish at first, like a drunk playing pin the tail on the donkey. But if this is done multiple times, the algorithm improves and eventually masters the art of spotting a face. This is the face detection step.Next up is the recognition part. This is done in various ways, but it’s common to use a second neural network. It is fed a series of face pictures and learns – over many rounds – how best to tell one from another. Some algorithms explicitly map the face, measuring the distances between the eyes, nose and mouth and so on. Others map the face using more abstract features. Either way, the network outputs a vector for each face – a string of numbers that uniquely identifies the person among all the others in the training set.It’s not the only way the police use facial recognition. If a suspect has been picked up, officers can upload their mugshot and search CCTV footage to potentially trace the suspect’s movements back to the scene of a crime.But such great performance depends on ideal conditions: where a crisp and clear mugshot of an unknown person is checked against a database of other high quality photos. In the real world, images can be blurred or poorly lit, people look away from the camera, or may have a scarf over their face, or be much older than in their reference photo. All tend to reduce the accuracy.The technology has a terrible time with twins, the Nist tests found, with even the best algorithms muddling them up.Bias has long plagued facial recognition algorithms. The problem comes about when neural networks are trained on different numbers of faces from different groups of people. So if a system is trained on a million white male faces, but fewer women and people of colour, it will be less accurate for the latter groups. Less accuracy means more misidentifications and potentially more people being wrongly stopped and questioned.Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) found that Amazon’s Rekognition software wrongly identified 28 members of Congress as people who had previously been arrested. It disproportionately misidentified African-Americans and Latinos. Amazon said the ACLU had used the wrong settings.Police trials have highlighted further shortcomings of facial recognition. A Cardiff University review of the South Wales trials found that the force’s NEC NeoFace system froze, lagged and crashed when the screen was full of people and performed worse on gloomy days and in the late afternoon because the cameras ramped up their light sensitivity, making footage more “noisy”.During 55 hours of deployment the system flagged up 2,900 potential matches of which 2,755 were false positives. The police made 18 arrests using the system, but the Cardiff report does not state whether any of the iniduals were charged.The Welsh trial highlighted another challenge for facial recognition: lambs. Not farmyard fugitives but people on the watchlist who happen look like plenty of other people. While scanning the crowds at Welsh rugby matches, the NeoFace system spotted one woman on the South Wales police watch list 10 times. None of them were her.Tech firms around the world are developing facial recognition but the US, Russia, China, Japan, Israel and Europe lead the way. Some nations have embraced the technology more readily than others.China has millions of cameras connected to facial recognition software and Russia has declared hopes to expand its own surveillance networks. In Europe, as elsewhere, facial recognition has found its way into shops to spot thieves and into businesses to monitor staff and visitors, but live face recognition in public spaces is still mostly at trial stage.In the US, the police typically use facial recognition to search CCTV footage for suspects rather than scanning live crowds. But it is becoming more pervasive. A 2016 report from Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that half of all Americans are in police facial recognition databases, meaning that algorithms pick suspects from virtual line-ups of 117 million mostly law-abiding citizens.Not much. In Britain there is no law that gives the police the power to use facial recognition and no government policy on its use. This has led to what Paul Wiles, the Biometrics commissioner, calls a chaotic situation with the police deciding for themselves where and when it is appropriate to use facial recognition and what happens to the images the cameras capture.The campaign group, Liberty, has called for a complete ban on live facial recognition systems in public spaces, arguing that it destroys privacy and forces people to change their behaviour. The group has brought a judicial review against South Wales police over its use of the technology. Similar concerns were raised by the University of Essex in an independent review of the politan police force’s use of facial recognition. It found that people were wrongly stopped, and warned of “surveillance creep” where the technology ends up being used to track people who are not wanted by the courts. Live facial recognition, the report concluded, was likely to fall foul of human rights law.Another area of contention is watchlists. Despite a 2012 high court ruling that retaining images of innocent people was unlawful, the police have steadily built up a custody database of 20 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. Nonetheless, images from the database, and others scraped from social media, are used to create watchlists for use in facial recognition systems. In the private sector, the situation is even murkier, with shops and businesses deciding who goes on secret watchlists, and sharing images with other firms.In the US the situation is not much better. Only five states have laws that touch on the use of facial recognition by law enforcement. The patchwork of laws means that while the Seattle police force and San Francisco city have banned live facial recognition, the sheriff’s office in Maricopa County, Arizona, uploaded the photo and driver’s licence of every resident in Honduras to its facial recognition watchlist.While facial recognition technology has drawn huge attention, the police and other organisations are looking carefully at new biometrics, beyond fingerprints and DNA, that uniquely identify people.Skin texture analysis is said to overcome problems with facial recognition caused by different expressions and partially covered faces by analysing the distance between skin pores. It has not been tested much, but developers claim it could be good enough to distinguish between twins.Another biometric that interests the police, because it can be done at a distance without a person’s cooperation, is gait analysis. As the name suggests, the algorithms identify people by the unique style of their stride, reflecting differences in anatomy, genetics, social background, habits and personality.With vein recognition, optical scanners are used to map blood vessels in the hand, finger or eye. Because our veins are buried beneath the skin, the scanners are considered hard to fool. Fujitsu’s PalmSecure system uses vein maps to monitor the to and fro of employees at various businesses.Speaker recognition is already used by banks and the HMRC to confirm people’s identities and its use is spreading. Unlike speech recognition, which translates sounds to words, speaker recognition detects the unique acoustic patterns created by an inidual’s vocal tract and their speech habits.Meanwhile, tech firms are improving their systems to work faster, with more faces, and with ever-more-difficult images, such as those taken in bad light or when people have their faces covered. Though still in its infancy, work is under way on algorithms that can identify people wearing masks and other disguises. To make recognition systems even more effective, face biometrics will be combined with others such as voice and gait, according to the Home Office’s 2018 Biometrics Strategy. Unsurprisingly, an arms race is afoot: researchers at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh have developed their own sunglasses to fool facial recognition: one male researcher who wore a pair was identified as Milla Jovovich.Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance Kelly A GatesPrivacy in the Face of Surveillance: Fourth Amendment Considerations for Facial Recognition Technology Naval Postgraduate SchoolHandbook of Face Recognition Stan Z Li and Anil K Jain"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddabca11d5899f2113ba1bbbabe4ee15b3d6f843/292_1510_3093_1856/master/3093.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9eeed3fa8d435063e35cb1fbe6bd024","title":"stacey dooley work really hard one of few talents","story":"Her critics say she is too emotional, has too many rough edges, even plays the ‘white saviour’. But the TV journalist gets the stories and is ratings dynamiteStacey Dooley is so fresh-faced she could pass for a teenager. But, at 32, she has been making investigative programmes for 12 years, and has clocked up 80-odd documentaries around the world, taking on terrorists, paedophile networks, rightwing extremists and international drug dealers. She has just returned from Syria, where she met European Islamic State brides for her first Panorama and Nigeria, where she got to know Boko Haram’s female suicide bombers. Last year, she wrote a bestselling book about inspirational women and won Strictly Come Dancing. On Friday it was announced that she had signed a £250,000-a-year golden handcuffs deal to work only for the BBC.Earlier this year, she found herself splashed across the tabloids – first for starting a relationship with her Strictly dance partner Kevin Clifton, then for being labelled “a white saviour” by the Labour MP David Lammy after making a Comic Relief documentary and posting a photo of herself and a young Ugandan child on social media. It’s been a busy old time.Dooley is a one-off: a working-class woman who left school with no qualifications, swears like a trooper, reports from the world’s most hostile territories and frequently tops the TV ratings charts. She has achieved the seemingly impossible – presenting programmes about subjects so bleak they would make most BBC editors blanch, while encouraging a generation of news-shy young people to embrace world affairs. Women, children, the marginalised and the exploited are at the heart of her documentaries. Last year, she won an MBE for her services to journalism.“Hi, I’m Stacey,” she says with a wink and a handshake when we meet in a London restaurant. Her fans might expect a hug – she is famously tactile in her documentaries – but perhaps the real Dooley is more complex than the empathetic naif who loves to tell it straight. Sure, she is warm and direct, but she is also businesslike.Dooley says she is the hardest-working person she knows. “It’s one of my few talents,” she admits. “I’ve always had a decent work ethic, probably because of my mother, when it was just her and me. She just worked so hard. She’d get up at silly o’clock, clean her pal’s house, then do her day job, then work in pubs at night.” Dooley’s father, who had a drink problem, was not part of her life. Her mother later met her partner, Norman, and they had a child together – Dooley’s sister. Both girls were bridesmaids at their wedding. But it was the early years that shaped Dooley.She grew up with her mother in Luton, in Bedfordshire, surrounded by rightwing extremists and Islamist fundamentalists. Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson, went to her school (she confronted him and al-Muhajiroun activists in the film My Hometown Fanatics). Young Stacey was mouthy and opinionated. Again, she says, it was down to her mother. “My mum stands up for what she thinks is right. She’s tough.” Has Dooley got that toughness? “Yes. I’ve always been quite bloody-minded. You’ve got to have the courage to say what you believe.”That bloody-mindedness came into its own in her early teens. “I was a nightmare.” In what way? “I wasn’t frightened of authority. I just did whatever I wanted.” She started drinking, clubbing, bunking off school. “I probably drove my mum loopy. I wouldn’t come home and I’d be out smoking and drinking.” Anything else? “I’d steal.” She smiles. “Nothing ridiculous like cars. I’d just go down the Arndale and rob a couple of Morgan tops. The thing I nicked the most was blue eyeliner from the chemist. I was always wearing blue eyeliner and blue mascara, which, on reflection, probably wasn’t my best look.” Did she steal with friends? “Yes. But I was good. I never got caught.”These days, she says, she’s a goody-goody – no smoking, no drinking, no tea-leafing. As for drugs, she has never touched them. She says she saw too much when she was growing up. “We lost a friend to drugs we lost another friend to drink. He didn’t reach 18. We all used to drink. Then you get yourself in a mess and you fall asleep and choke on your own sick …” She trails off. “That wasn’t the moment I thought: ‘I’m never drinking again.’ But I’m sure it makes you think twice.”Dooley says the story that she left school at 15 without qualifications is not quite right. She turned up for three of her GCSEs (English, Music and Biology), but she never bothered collecting her results. Her face lights up. “Maybe I did really well. I might have got three As and I’ve been underselling myself all this time!”She sold perfume by day at Luton airport and did pub work in the evening, spending all her money on clothes – most of them cheap and throwaway. One day, her mother spotted an advert for young people who were obsessed with fast fashion to go to India and discover how their clothes were made. “It said: ‘Do you like travel, do you like fashion, do you like telly?’ And for me it was tick, tick, tick.” As soon as she applied for the job, she knew she would get it. Again, the Dooley confidence. “You’ve got to think: ‘Why not me?’ They’ve got to have someone.”Watch Blood, Sweat and T-shirts now, 10 years on, and you can see that Dooley arrived almost fully formed. She was unfiltered, pasionate and addressed the camera as if it was her best friend. In one scene, after talking to a tiny boy who was sent by his family to work in a Bombay factory, she turns to the camera, outraged and tearful. “Sorry, the boss of the factory Mohammed was working at used to beat him up really bad, so he ran away. He’s just a baby and he got beaten up by a grown man. It just makes you feel sick.” The tears became another Dooley trademark.After returning from India she was invited by the then controller of BBC Three, Danny Cohen, to make her own documentaries. She asked simple, heartfelt questions that trained journalists were often too polite or cerebral to ask. Occasionally, Dooley has almost become a self-parody – asking for a couple of minutes while she turns away to weep, ranting at the world’s injustices, wrapping her arms around a victim she has just met. But so much of her portfolio is amazing – asking an Isis fighter who said he had killed 900 people and raped 200 women: “What was going through your mind when these girls were screaming for you to stop and you don’t?” telling a drug dealer he is a hypocrite because he wouldn’t dream of selling to his children confronting women who have sold their children for sex.Has she become addicted to violence and war zones like so many foreign correspondents? No, she says, she can’t wait to get away. So many people who do her work have PTSD, she says, but she’s lucky. She doesn’t even have nightmares. “I think it’s because my mind is clear … You have to look after yourself mentally when you’re making films about incest and paedophilia and cartels cutting people’s heads off.” After a tough day, she switches off by listening to Little Mix. (“I love Woman Like Me.” Does her work scare her? “I’m such a wimp. I don’t even like flying, so it is slightly ridiculous that I do this job.” She says she was most terrified in north-east Nigeria. “I was in Maiduguri, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and there were times when I thought I might have to leave early because I can’t handle feeling frightened like this. Every night you could hear the military shelling, and you’re thinking: ‘How am I going to get out?’” Did she tell her mother she was in Maiduguri? She grins. “No, I told her I was in Lagos.” How does your mum feel about you lying? “It’s for her own good because all she would do is panic.”Dooley’s work has politicised her. After all the abuses she has witnessed in criminalised drugs and sex industries, she would consider legalising both. She has always voted Labour. “I always think it’s odd when people say: ‘I don’t give a fuck about politics,’ because it determines how you live.” We meet the day Boris Johnson moves into No 10. “I don’t know how long he’ll last,” she says.Colleagues are less snobbish to her than they used to be, she says. What’s the worst thing they have said? “Oh God, I’ve had it all. Sometimes they would say: ‘Ooh, you’ve got holes in your jeans,’ or mimic my accent.” Did she give them a mouthful? “No.” Why not? “Because I don’t give a fuck what they think. Some people don’t understand why I’m there. But I work really hard and I deserve to be there. And our documentaries speak for themselves. We are always top three on iPlayer and often we are most watched factual. The only one we can’t beat is EastEnders.”If some colleagues don’t appreciate the role she plays at the BBC, she certainly does. “We all pay our TV licence. It doesn’t matter whether you live on an estate in Luton or you live around the corner from Hyde Park and studied at Oxbridge – we all need to be heard. We all need to look at people on television and say: ‘Yeah, they represent me in some way.’ That’s where we’ve gone wrong in the past. I think the BBC would be the first to say current affairs is still too white and too middle-class and too male-heavy.”What she says about people being heard is interesting, particularly in light of Lammy’s “white saviour” attack on her. She fought back ferociously on Twitter. Does she think she might have misjudged it – that it would have been better to say ‘Let’s have a chat’ rather than beat him into submission? “I did say that a couple of times, but they never pick up on it. I would love to have spoken to David.” Does she now think he had a point? “I would take on board the criticism and bear in mind that people have certain views and I can’t tell people how to feel. I would be mindful of that.” Would she do Comic Relief again? “I believe in what they do. As one of the richest countries in the world, we have a responsibility to help those in need. Going forward, I hope we’re able to keep raising money in a way that everyone feels comfy with.” It’s funny – for a moment she sounds like a politician.When Dooley was invited to compete on Strictly, she was already well known. Now she is a household name. How has it changed her life? “There’s more interest in my personal life.” Is she surprised? “Yes.” Really? “Yes! What I’m surprised at is that I go to places like Syria and meet some of the most recognisable terrorists in the world or talk about things that will shape the global landscape – enormous topics that warrant front pages of papers – but they never go with that. They’ll always go with who I fancy or who I’m snogging.”Rant over, she acknowledges that Strictly has been wonderful for her, despite the fact that her ex-partner, Sam Tucknott, now has custody of their bulldog Bernie. Was there a fight over Bernie? “No. It would be irresponsible of me to take Bernie because I’m never here. Sam is amazing with him, and if I wanted to see Bernie, he would let me.”Her critics claim she has given up on the serious stuff for celebrity. Does it upset her? “Yeah, I think that’s an unfair statement. When you win Strictly, you can go down two paths. All the offers come in, and you can do very little work and put your name to things for lots of money, or you can go back to making documentaries in Syria and Nigeria and work really bloody hard. I said no to a lot of things I didn’t believe in. It’s not that I’m holier than thou, it’s just that it wasn’t for me. So I went back to the day job.”I ask again if she really expected us not to be interested in her private life after Strictly. Well, maybe not, she says, but she could always hope. “Kev and I have agreed not to go into too much detail about our private lives because you can’t really indulge that and then ask for privacy. That’s why we’ve turned down interviews that have offered us tens of thousands of pounds. What I am happy to say is Kev’s amazing, I’m happy, life happens, I’ve got an amazing career and I’m very lucky.”Did she expect to win Strictly? “I thought: ‘Why not – someone’s got to win it.’” Did she deserve to? “Yes!” she says instantly. “I worked really hard. I didn’t know how to waltz beforehand, I didn’t know what a ballroom frame looked like.” Did she work harder than everyone else? “Yes,” she says even more emphatically. She bursts out laughing. So the old Dooley work ethic triumphed? “Yes! My one skill.”• Stacey Dooley: Face to Face with the Bounty Hunters is on BBC Three on Wednesday 31 July.

She is derided by the far left for her pragmatism, despite being a long-time target for Republicans. Photograph: Getty I, the daughter of a DC cop, and Carl, the son of an Illinois plumber, were hilariously painted as decadent aristocrats revelling like Marie Antoinette when we should have been knitting like Madame Defarge. Yo, proletariat: If the Democratic Party is going to be against chocolate, high heels, parties and fun, you’ve lost me.And I’ve got some bad news for you about 2020. The progressives are the modern Puritans. The Massachusetts Bay Colony is alive and well on the Potomac and Twitter. They eviscerate their natural allies for not being pure enough while placing all their hopes in a colour-inside-the-lines lifelong Republican prosecutor appointed by Ronald Reagan. The politics of purism makes people stupid. And nasty. My father stayed up all night the night Harry Truman was elected because he was so excited. I would like to stay up ’til dawn the night a Democrat wins next year because I’m so excited to see the moment when the despicable Donald Trump lumbers into a Marine helicopter and flies away for good.But Democrats are making that dream ever more distant because they are using their time knifing one another and those who want to be on their side instead of playing it smart. House Democrats forced Robert Mueller to testify, after he made it clear that he was spent and had nothing to add to his damning yet damnably legalistic, double-negative report, because they were hoping the hearings would jump-start howls for impeachment.But it’s hard to get the mad blood stirring with Muellerisms like “This is outside my purview” “I can’t get into that” “I don’t subscribe necessarily to your – the way you analyse that” and “I’m not going to go into the ins and outs.” I never want to hear about the “OLC opinion” again. The Republicans were impressively craven and hypocritical. They are sticking with Trump, and no pallid reminder of his turpitude, his trellis of obstructions and his unpatriotic embrace of foreign interference in our elections will change that.The always blockheaded Texas representative Louie Gohmert shouldn’t even be allowed to hold the coat of Mueller, a war hero and respected public official. But Gohmert yelled such crazy stuff at the former special counsel that he appeared to be auditioning for a spot on Fox News’ The Five.The hearings were shameful for Republicans thirsting for re-election and a failure for Democrats thirsting for impeachment. It was many underwhelming hours of members of Congress reading to Mueller and Mueller saying, Yes, that’s what I wrote. Or at least what somebody wrote.The recipe for emotional satisfaction on the part of the progressive left is not a recipe for removing Trump from the White House. The argument about whether Trump is impeachable is the wrong argument. Mueller settled that. We know Trump did things worthy of impeachment. That is not the question we should be asking. The question is: should he be impeached? The progressive Puritans think we must honour the US constitution and go for it because it’s the right thing to do. You can argue that impeachment, morally and constitutionally, is the right thing to do.But you also have to recognise that, historically and politically, it is not the right thing to do because it will lead to disaster. The attempt to impeach Trump is one of the rare cases in which something obviously justified is obviously stupid. Unbelievably, Pelosi – long a GOP target for her unalloyed liberalism – is derided by the far left for her pragmatism. But she has been through enough Washington wars to know that idealism, untempered by realism, is dangerous. An impeachment could return Trump to power. The highchair king from Fifth Avenue would exult in his victimhood and energise his always-ready-to-be aggrieved followers. It could also lead to Democrats losing the House as their moderates fall and help Republicans hold the Senate. No Republicans would vote for impeaching Trump, and some Democrats might refuse as well. Even if the House acted, Mitch McConnell would smother it in the Senate, just like he did Merrick Garland.It’s better to pull out Trump by the roots in the election and firmly repudiate him. The Democrats should focus on the future, not the benighted past that we have been relegated to under Trump. Hillary Clinton’s campaign focused on what a terrible person Trump is. It turned out that enough voters knew that and didn’t care. They wanted a racist Rottweiler. Now the Democrats are once more focused on what a terrible person Trump is.Message received, many times over.The progressives’ cry that they don’t care about the political consequences because they have a higher cause is just a purity racket. Their mantra is like that of Ferdinand I, the Holy Roman Emperor: “Fiat iustitia, et pereat mundus.” “Let justice be done, though the world perish.”The rest of us more imperfect beings don’t want the world to perish. And maybe justice can be done, without losing the White House, the House, chocolate, high heels, parties and fun."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind

Jaden, 15, will share £1.8m with his playing partnerThe mother of a British schoolboy who won almost £1 million in the Fortnite World Cup has said that she tried to hard to stop him from playing the game that she threw out his Xbox and snapped his headset.Jaden  Ashman, 15, will split £1.8 million in prize money with his Dutch team-mate after winning second place in the Fortnite duos competition at the Athur Ashe stadium in New York City, which traditionally hosts the US Open tennis tournament.The teenager from Essex, who competes under the name Wolfiez, was among 100 Fortnite players who qualified for the game\u0027s first ever world cup, in which a total of more than £24 million is up for grabs with a top inidual prize of £2.4 million.But his mother, Lisa Dallman, said she didn\u0027t really know much about video games and had struggled to accept that his skill at Fortnite was more than a frivolous waste of time.It\u0027s not been a straightfoward journey with Jordan, Ms Dallman told BBC Five Live. If I\u0027m honest with you, I\u0027ve been quite against him gaming. I\u0027ve been more pushing him to his schoolwork. I\u0027ve actually thrown an Xbox out, snapped a headset, we\u0027ve had a nightmare.Leading up to the game, getting his visa, we had problems with that... then the dog ate his birth certificate. Then work messed up my wages. So three things went wrong before we started heading here.I had a feeling that Jaden was going to place top 10... he\u0027s come 2nd and I can\u0027t believe it.More than 100 players representing more than 30 countries competed in Fortnite\u0027s first World Cup, which is attempting to turn the game\u0027s massive international popularity into a glitzy competitive sport. The £24m prize pool is currently the biggest ever offered for any eSports event, though it is likely to be surpassed by the Dota 2 International in August.Ashman surprised many fans on Saturday by winning second place by using a joypad rather than a keyboard and mouse, which allow for finer control.Me and my mum, we clash quite a lot, he said after the tournament. She didn\u0027t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time. Mow that I\u0027ve proved to her that I can do stuff, I\u0027m really happy.Other Brits also placed well in the duos tournament. Kyle Mongraal Jackson, 14, who became the youngest ever eSports player when he was recruited by a team aged 13, won half of £363,000 with 6th place, while Mac Itemm Gillivray came just behind him at 8th place.Altogether, British players won almost $1.4 million, with more money likely to flow from the singles tournament, in which Jackson and his fellow Brit Benjy David Fish (Benjyfishy) are tipped to place well. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It was a term of with friendliness and camaraderie.And, as a kid, everyone had a favourite uncle who would bring them sweets as a treat. We think he just put the two together and came up with Uncle Joe.The sweets are stocked in Harrods and Harvey Nichols in London and New York and are popular as far afield as Japan.   The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downLast month PSA said its next generation of the Astra would be built from 2021 at Russelsheim in Germany and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire,\u0026nbspbut warned this was “conditional” on a satisfactory\u0026nbspBrexit deal.The car manufacturer has now gone further by suggesting it could pull out of Ellesmere Port, which could spell the end of the plant.Vauxhall Astra to be built in UK, but only if no-deal Brexit avoided“Frankly I would prefer to put it in Ellesmere Port but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable then I have to protect the rest of the company,” said Mr Tavares. “We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port.”The threat to move production follows Friday’s warning from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders that a no-deal Brexit was an “existential threat” to the industry.Vauxhall, which was owned by US carmaker General Motors before being bought by PSA in 2017, launched an ad campaign for the Astra last year that billed its bestselling model as “true Brit”, on the basis that versions of the car have been built at Ellesmere Port for over 40 years.The Cheshire plant still employs 1,000-plus workers despite more than 650 job cuts\u0026nbspsince last year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The challenge has been limp indeed.\u0026nbspThere was no government or EU involvement in  Bank, which was once the little bank that could, with its free dog biscuits and seven-day town centre branches. It\u0026nbsprode a wave of goodwill when it was set up by Vernon Hill and Anthony Thomson. They promised a bank where the customer was king and\u0026nbspso it has mostly proved, with the bank regularly topping service surveys.\u0026nbspBut confidence in the institution has been dented by a regulatory foul-up and a spate of damaging rumours on social media.It has lost deposits and last week announced that profits had crashed. A big book of mortgages was sold and the search for a replacement for Hill as chair\u0026nbspis under way.\u0026nbspThomson went on to form Atom, an app-based outfit in the northeast, which recently raised another £50m from investors. The most recent accounts showed that it’s still losing a bunch of money and the prospect of a sale to one of its big backers\u0026nbsphas been killed off by Brexit. High-profile money manager Neil Woodford was among those who ponied up. His name on the shareholder register used to be viewed as a good sign. In the wake of the suspension of dealings in his\u0026nbspflagship fund, however, that’s no longer true.\u0026nbspTSB started off well after being spun out of Lloyds. It enjoyed a successful flotation and was subsequently gobbled up by Spain’s Banco Sabadell. But much of its early good work was trashed after it had its reputation shredded by an IT meltdown last year.\u0026nbspWilliams \u0026amp Glyn, the business-focussed bank that was supposed to emerge from RBS, never got out of the starting blocks. The bank ultimately worked out a deal with the EU to provide funding for existing competitors in the business banking space.\u0026nbspTesco Bank, meanwhile, recently sold its mortgage book and walked away from what has become a brutally competitive market.\u0026nbspThere’s really no common theme running through the difficulties these businesses have\u0026nbspencountered. Their stories really\u0026nbspjust serve to demonstrate how hard it is to get new banking businesses to fly when faced by four or five very big, well-established players.\u0026nbspFar from providing extra competition to them, the challengers are starting to find themselves being outcompeted. The ring-fenced retail banking arms of the leading banks, with their fat capital cushions, have, for example, stormed into the mortgage market brandishing cheap rates that customers have flocked to, HSBC in particular.\u0026nbspIt should be said at this point that not all smaller banks are struggling, a point made by Investec’s banking analyst Ian Gordon.\u0026nbspHe highlights the success enjoyed by\u0026nbsp“specialist banks”\u0026nbspsuch as OneSavings, Charter Court, and Paragon, which “are having a fantastic time”.

The bank, as we know it today, was created by bolting together CYBG, the owner of the Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks that weren’t making particularly eye-catching progress before the deal, and the former Virgin, which was built from the good bits of Northern Rock Richard Branson bought from the government for a song. It had at least been growing at a decent clip.\u0026nbspTheir merger was a smart and sensible deal and there should be an opportunity for it to grow smartly from here. It just has to prove it can live up to its promise.\u0026nbspIt probably won’t worry the big five too much, but these days it’s looking very much like the last genuinely punchy contender capable of mounting any sort of challenge at all.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rudderless Just Eat needs this as Amazon and Uber move inClick to followThe IndependentJust Eat told its noisy shareholders that a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway wasn’t on the menu when it updated the market in March. Now there’s a deal between the two at the door and steam is coming off the shares.\u0026nbspReports of something in the offing started doing the rounds at the end of last week. This morning the terms were announced. That’s some smart delivering.\u0026nbspWhat’s being served up is an all share tie up in which the two sides, who said no no no when activist investor Cat Rock Capital started banging the table and demanding something be done just a few short months ago, theoretically sharing the spoils.\u0026nbspJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on appRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’So Just Eat gets to fill the positions of chairman and the finance director, while the shares will have a premium listing in London. But Takeaway\u0027s youthful CEO Jitse Groen will run the business, which will be headquartered and domiciled in the Netherlands under the Dutch corporate structure.\u0026nbspHis colleagues are slated to hold two of the other three top executive positions.\u0026nbspTakeaway, a significantly smaller business in terms of number of orders, earnings and revenues, is clearly the winner. It’s eating its rival.\u0026nbspThis is a takeover in everything but name.Just Eat’s investors could scarcely be happier about that. The shares shot up by 25 per cent. Compare that to Takeawawy, which put something more like 3.5 per cent despite apparently getting the better of the deal.Part of the discrepancy can be explained by speculation that a counter bid may emerge for Just Eat, and it’s a realistic possibility. Partly it’s because Groen is well regarded and the deal gets Just Eat out of a real hole.It was much criticised for under delivering under former boss Peter Plumb. When his acting replacement Peter Duffy made it clear he didn’t want the job on the permanent basis, it wasn’t altogether clear where the company would turn (other than to Groen).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

If you really want a laugh, the shares in the combined company are split 52 to 48 (Just East gets the bigger number).\u0026nbspCat Rock’s purring meanwhile. That was the obvious line doing the rounds. In reality, however, it’s pushed the two companies down a road they almost had to follow.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All the couples are also treated to a dancing lesson.Love Island is currently the most-watched programme for adults aged 16-34 in the UK, across any channel, with the latest season breaking a new record for the show after attracting more than six million viewers.Created with Sketch.Love Island 2019: The best moments from the series Show all 75Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.175 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.275 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.975 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1075 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1175 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1275 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1475 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1575 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1875 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2075 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2175 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2275 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2475 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2575 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2675 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2775 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2875 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3175 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3275 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3375 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3475 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3675 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3875 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3975 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4075 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4175 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4275 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4475 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4575 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4775 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4875 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4975 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5075 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5175 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5275 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5375 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5675 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5875 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6075 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6175 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 6275 Ovie kisses new girl IndiaOvie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris6375 Michael finally admits he still likes AmberAfter spending weeks vehemently denying it, Michael eventually pulled Amber aside to tell her he still had feelings for her. 6475 Amber recouples with GregAmber was forced to choose between old flame Michael and new romance Greg. “It’s hard choosing whether to go with your heart or your head… it’s been hard,” she said, before choosing Irish rugby player Greg. 6575 Francesca savages Michael in her recoupling speechAfter Amber chose Greg, Francesca was left with only one man to choose from - Michael. She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6675 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6775 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa. Michael left on a good note with Amber, admitting he wasn’t “the nicest person” over the past few weeks and saying he was happy to see Amber getting on well with Greg. 6875 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couplesIslanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis’ relationship “staged,” that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that “bored” Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.6975 Jordan goes on a kamikaze missionDespite having asked Anna to be his girlfriend only two days before, Jordan decided his emerging romantic feelings for India were too powerful to ignore. On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a “mate.” Ouch. It didn’t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. “You ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?” Anna yelled. “It’s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!” Amber added. “You’re a f*cking liar,” shouted Maura for good measure. 7175 Curtis lands in hot waterCurtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first. Aside from some harsh words from Maura, Anna sat him down and told him he was a “narcissist,” saying “you move like you’re such a good person, but you’re not”.Anna, Jordan, Harley and Chris were all dumped from the villa following a public vote. Although she seemed glad to leave Jordan, Anna left Molly Mae, Amber and Maura in tears after she told them: “I’m so grateful for you three, because I feel like I found love with you guys.”7375 The couples go on their final datesHelicopter rides, yacht trips and candlelit dinners... the remaining five couples enjoyed their final dates in this particularly romantic episode. Tommy and Molly-Mae got serious over dinner, speaking about how they might even be ready to move in together.7475 \u0027Meet the parents\u0027In one of the most popular segments of the series, each contestant received a visit from members of their family – and got to introduce them to their respective partners. Cut to Curtis\u0027s mum being unable to say Maura (she kept saying Moira), Greg\u0027s mum giving Amber a shamrock necklace, and Anton\u0027s mum handing Belle a razor so she could continue shaving his arse. 7575 Anton and Belle get dumped before the finalPoor Anton. He didn\u0027t have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise – if only to him – when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. We\u0027re fine, he\u0027d whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not.175 Lucie trying - and failing - to make ‘bev’ happenLove Island is known for adding new slang to the British lexicon, but 21-year-old Lucie’s firm insistence that ‘bev’ means a hot man failed to catch on.275 Amber’s anti-chemistry with Callum Straight-talking Amber quickly made mincemeat of Callum, the first boy she coupled up with. After correcting him when he said he looked younger than his 28 years, she confirmed it was his wrinkles which were aging him. She would go on to diss his sunglasses before ditching him for Anton during the next coupling.Sensitive boxer Tommy has been vocal about his love for Miley Cyrus’ teen sitcom since day one. His fandom reached new heights when he serenaded Curtis with a rendition of her hit song ‘The Climb’ to illustrate his path to winning Lucie’s heart. Aww.Blonde surfer Lucie was an instant hit in the villa, with almost every boy trying a cheeky graft. She seemed torn between Tommy and Joe, who each went nuclear in their attempt to woo her. Tommy pledged that he would crawl to the moon and back for her after knowing her for around 24 hours. Despite this, Joe’s jealous moping eventually won out. The confident Scotsman’s seduction skills manage to be both slippery smooth yet wildly erratic. His mile-a-minute chat has failed to land with any of the Love Island ladies, leading his to receive a cold shoulder from from Lucie, Anna and Mollie Mae. The raunchy challenge saw the boys strip down to chaps and speedos before hopping on a bucking bronco and getting covered in paint splatter. Performances ranged from smooth (Michael and Sherif) to deeply awkward (Callum and Joe).Amy had a minor wobble when newcomer Mollie Mae picked her man Curtis to join her for a date in the hot tub. She shouldn’t have worried: Curtis firmly friendzoned Mollie Mae and settled in for a gossip about his fellow housemates instead.Anton seemed confident at the first recoupling that pharmacist Anna would choose him. His confident smile on hearing Anna compliment her mystery love’s body quickly turned into disappointment when he realised she had been talking about Sherif.975 Calum leaves the villaThe aircraft engineer barely seemed to grace our screens before he was ejected after Mollie Mae chose to couple up with Tommy. 1075 Tommy makes his first cup of tea Tommy shocked the nation when he revealed he didn’t know how to make a cup of peppermint tea. With a lot of coaching from Sherif, the boxer managed to impress Mollie Mae without her realising the truth.1175 Tommy convinces himself he made an omeletteEncouraged by his success, Tommy tried to step up his culinary game by impressing Mollie Mae with a breakfast omelette (with Curtis doing the actual cooking.) Tommy even seemed to convince himself that he cooked the omelette, although he was rumbled after Sherif let slip who really made it.1275 Yewande’s quest for love Gorgeous scientist Yewande had been unlucky in love in the villa – until she was picked for a date by newcomer Danny. The rest of the Islanders encouraged her fledgling romance, from putting in a good word with Danny to criticising Mollie Mae’s attempt to woo the new boy for herself. Nine days into the series Love Island bosses confirmed that Sherif had been suddenly ejected from the show after “breaking the villa rules.” The 20-year-old confirmed his departure was due to his “poor judgement”, but it remains unknown which rule he broke. 1475 Curtis and Amy become a half-couple Amy may have never had a boyfriend before, but she was the first girl to make it official in the villa – sort of. During a date in the hideaway, Curtis asked her to become exclusive, which ended up with her getting the very high school label of ‘half-girlfriend.’1575 Amber opens up Amber gained a reputation for withering looks and cutting putdowns, but one man was able to get past her icy exterior. Firefighter Michael proved he could take her self-proclaimed a attitude, and was rewarded – on the second try – with a kiss.With Sherif out the villa, Anton resumed his moves on Anna. This time, it went even worse than before, with the Scotsman inadvertently comparing her with Mollie Mae, calling Anna beautiful ‘on the inside’. He thought the chat went well a dressing down from Amber and Michael soon put him in his place. Tommy was tasked with making a starter for his date with new girl Maura. “I’ve never put so much effort into cheese in my life,” he said, as he carved out lovehearts from limp sliced cheddar. The result, two slices of ketchup and mayo-smeared white bread, proved that Maura’s continuing lust for the 20-year-old boxer is made of powerful stuff. 1875 The girls freak out over Maura and Elma Amber, Yewande and Mollie Mae watched their respective partners meet the new girls from the balcony. “Confident sh*ts,” fumed Amber, while Mollie made fun of their flirty laughter.Michael brands Amber\u0027s behaviour as childish after the beauty therapist heckled his date with Maura.2075 Tommy and Mollie Mae fightMollie Mae wasn\u0027t happy when Tommy seemed interested in new girl Maura, and wasn\u0027t afraid to let the boxer know how she felt.2175 Amy and Lucie fall outLucie tearfully stood up for herself after Amy accused her of not spending enough time with the girls. Is Lucie just not a girl’s girl, or did Amy drive her away?2275 Maura gets a rise out of TommyMaura had her sights set on the 20-year-old boxer from the start, and things got steamy when she got him into bed. Her straight-up seduction techniques proved a bit too exciting for Tommy, who got a little hot and bothered under the covers. Just wait until he sees her eat an ice lolly…Maura went full factor 50 on Tommy when she ambushed him on the sofa. Tommy put his boxing training into practice as he dodged her kisses, while a jealous Mollie Mae watched on from behind a potted plant.2475 Jordan and Tom enter the villaAfter being the only two girls not picked for recoupling, Anna and Maura got to go on a date with the new boys: 29-year-old Tom and 24-year-old Jordan.2575 Joe and Elma leave the villaThe islanders voted for the couple they thought was least compatible, leaving the Joe-Lucie and Anton-Elma couples vulnerable. The public voted off Joe and Elma, ending the tumultuous relationship between the surfer and the sandwich maker (and leaving Anton single once again).2675 Anna and Jordan take it up a notchAnna and Jordan sealed the deal with a sensuous kiss, with Anna later rating the model as a 1010 kisser.2775 Arabella arrives – and immediately shakes things upAfter swearing to Yewande that a new girl wouldn’t turn his head, Danny was immediately smitten with fellow model Arabella after their flirty first date.2875 Yewande lays it on with DannySensing danger, Yewande made an effort to be more affectionate with Danny, kissing him in front of the rest of the islanders.During a challenge, a blindfolded Curtis accidentally rated Arabella a 1010 kisser, while giving his half-girlfriend Amy a measly seven. Amy was not happy, storming off followed by an apologetic Curtis.Arabella stirred the pot when she accused Yewande of being overly-possessive of Danny, telling her a few uncomplimentary remarks Danny had made about her to boot. A devastated Yewande soon realised that her fledgling romance was in serious jeopardy.3175 Maura is livid at TomMaura’s carrot-swallowing skills won her first place during the gym bunny challenge, giving her a night in the hideaway as a prize. Maura chose Tom to join her, but things quickly went south after she overheard him brag to the boys about finding out whether or not the Irish beauty was “all mouth.” Tom got a scathing dressing down, and a night in the hideaway was firmly off the cards.3275 Yewande leaves the islandDanny chose Arabella during a recoupling, leaving Yewande as the eliminated singleton. She was devastated to leave best mates Amber and Anna, but Danny was left with a scathing parting shot: “What goes around comes around.” Ouch.3375 Danny faces the wrath of AmberAmber was furious after watching Danny kiss Arabella the same night that Yewande left the villa. She had some choice words for the model, although Danny stayed calm and collected during the confrontation.3475 Curtis and Tommy share an intimate momentAfter declaring how much their friendship meant to each other, Tommy and Curtis shared the season’s first bromance kiss. Perhaps if they ditched their girlfriends, Turtis could go all the way to the £50k?During a challenge which saw the islanders read the public’s tweets, some couples were left seriously shaken. Amy was called out for making Curtis feel “in the wrong,” Lucie and Tommy were named as a good potential couple and Mollie Mae was accused of faking her relationship with Tommy for the prize money.3675 Mollie Mae worries about LucieThe Twitter challenge made Mollie Mae re-examine Tommy’s close friendship with Lucie. After a chat with Mollie Mae, the boxer told Lucie they should stop being so affectionate with each other. A disgruntled Lucie complained about the new “rules” imposed on her, while also refusing to rule out a potential relationship with Tommy during a chat with the girls.Maura wasn’t happy to hear that Tom had called her “attention-seeking” and “cringey” behind her back. She stormed over and confronted him, later making it clear he had blown his second chance.3875 Arabella and Tom get dumped from the islandAfter four couples were left vulnerable following a public vote, the three safe couples decided that Arabella and Tom should be the pair to leave the villa. Maura comforted a devastated Danny, but didn’t appear to be that heartbroken about losing Tom.3975 Lucie confesses her feelings for Tommy Encouraged by Anton, Lucie revealed to Tommy that she would be interested in rekindling their romance. Tommy told her he was happy with Mollie Mae, and later told Mollie about Lucie’s confession, leading Mollie to brand the Cornish surfer “muggy” for not coming to her first.4075 The girls take a holiday to Casa AmorSix new boys entered the game when the girls took a trip to Casa Amor. A thrilled Maura took an instant liking to Dennon, while 6ft 7in basketball player Ovie immediately cracked on with Anna, leaving her relationship with Jordan in jeopardy. 4175 Six new girls cause the boys to have doubtsBack at the villa, heads were also turning at the arrival of six new girls. Jordan flirted with Jourdan, Anton shared a bed with Belle and Danny seemed ready to move on from his Arabella heartbreak. Michael and Curtis began to question their own seemingly-solid partnerships, thanks to pretty newcomer Joanna. Anton remained hopeful about his odds of finally finding love: “I’ve got six new chances to not get pied.”4275 Curtis tells Jourdan he wants to recouple with herCurtis took a risk and laid it all out to Jourdan, telling her he would choose to recouple with her over Amy. Smitten with Danny, Jourdan politely brushed him off: “Stay loyal to the situation you’re in now, because I need you as a friend,” she said.Michael and Amber’s romance appeared dead in the water as Michael finally made his move on new girl Joanna.4475 Amy confesses she has fallen in love with Curtis4575 There were some awkward recouplings after Casa Amor…Amy was thrilled that Curtis had chosen to recouple with her – although she was soon to find out that he had made a move on another girl and told everyone that their relationship needs work. Michael recoupled with Joanna, leaving Amber single – and absolutely fuming. Poor Jordan saw Anna return with basketball player Ovie, although she was more apologetic about it than Michael. Mollie Mae collapsed into relieved tears when she saw Tommy waiting for her, holding her favourite stuffed elephant toy Ellie-Belly. Anton finally found himself in a romantic couple with Belle, Lucie coupled with new blonde bombshell George and Maura seemed keen on sensitive Marvin.4775 Michael and Curtis catch some serious heatAfter seeing Amber in tears, Anna went straight for Michael’s jugular, accusing him of leading Amber on by not communicating his doubts about their relationship earlier. Michael went on the defensive, calling Anna and Amber “childish.” Meanwhile a tearful Amy gave Curtis a dressing down for making moves on Jourdan: “Do you know how worthless this makes me feel?”4875 Maura serves some cold, hard truthWhile Amy was discussing her drama with Curtis to Maura and Lucie, she seemed on the verge of forgiveness: “I love him,” she said. A doubtful Lucie interjected: “But does he love you?” A furious Maura took a less subtle approach: “Why are you asking her that? He doesn’t!” 4975 Lucie tells Tommy she has feelings for him – againAfter Tommy took Lucie aside to check they were still friends, she confessed she’s still attracted to him, wishes she had chosen him over Joe and was thinking about him the whole time she was in Casa Amor. Once again, Tommy brushed her off saying he was still smitten with Mollie Mae – perhaps third time lucky, Lucie?5075 Tommy and Mollie Mae get seriousAfter the latest declaration from Lucie, Tommy reassured Mollie Mae by telling her how much he liked her. Mollie Mae confessed she could see herself falling in love with him, before Tommy admitted he was already falling.5175 Anna and Jordan rekindle their romanceWhen Anna returned to the villa and saw Jordan was still single, she seemed to question her new romance with Ovie. After a few flirtations conversations with her old flame, she told Ovie that she and Jordan might not be over after all…5275 Curtis and Amy break upAmy was so determined to work out what had happened to suddenly derail her perfect half-relationship that she made a checklist to get to the bottom of it. But after a heartfelt chat, Curtis effectively ended things by telling Amy he couldn’t guarantee he would stay loyal to her. 5375 Maura reveals this years’ biggest plot twistIn a characteristically unpredictable move, Maura revealed to Lucie she had a crush – on the newly-single Curtis. “I want him to teach me how to dance,” she said, calling him “gorgeous”.Villa BFFs Maura and Lucie both grew tired of their Casa Amor romances, so agreed to tell the lads – as a group. George and Marvin were sat down and pied together, with Marvin reacting with outrage and George barely keeping a straight face. Ovie may have seemed like her perfect man in Casa Amor, but Jordan caught Anna’s eye once again when she returned to the villa. Anna sat down for a chat with the laid-back basketball player, but things got heated quickly. Ovie stormed off before Anna headed up for a sneaky balcony snog with Jordan. 5675 Tommy pulls off the perfect proposalTommy decided it was time to ask Mollie Mae to be his girlfriend. As with cooking, writing isn’t Tommy’s strong point, so he enlisted Curtis to write him a love note in eyeliner (who knew there were no pens in the villa?) Mollie Mae found the note tied to her toy Elly Belly, and happily agreed to making things official with Tommy.Not long after Danny coupled up with Yewande and Arabella the two girls were sent packing, leading presenter Iain Sterling to nickname Danny ‘the travel agent’ for his talent in sending girls to the airport. New partner Jourdan was the final girl to fall under Danny’s curse as the pair received the least votes, although this time Danny was booted from the villa too.5875 Amy leaves on heartbreaking noteAs she prepared to leave the villa, Amy took her ex Curtis aside for a chat. Days after Curtis had ended their relationship, she told him: You turned my whole world around and turned it into some kind of craziness. All I\u0027ve ever wanted is for you to be happy. And you\u0027re not going to be able to be happy if I\u0027m still here. As Curtis broke down in tears, she continued: I want us to be best friends and I want us to both find someone... I\u0027m not going to be ready in the next three weeks to meet someone else.He might be coupled up with Joanna, but it was Michael’s ex Amber who got his pulse racing fastest during the dirty dancing challenge. Amber was glad to hear it, saying: “So now I\u0027ve at least got something, I can\u0027t just sit and mope around because I know I raised his heart rate the most!6075 Anton and Belle hit the rocksShe may have shaved his bum, but Belle reached breaking point after a series of slip-ups from Anton. She wasn’t happy that he kissed Anna in the Snog, Marry, Pie challenge, and a confrontation ended in a heated exchange at the nightclub6175 Joanna and Michael say an awkward goodbyeAfter it was revealed that Joanna and Michael couldn’t stay in the villa together, their fellow Islanders chose to send Joanna packing. She was less than impressed with Michael after it became clear he wouldn’t follow her out of the door, refusing a hug and labelling him a “snake” for staying. 6275 Ovie kisses new girl IndiaOvie kisses new girl India on the terrace after stealing her from Chris6375 Michael finally admits he still likes AmberAfter spending weeks vehemently denying it, Michael eventually pulled Amber aside to tell her he still had feelings for her. 6475 Amber recouples with GregAmber was forced to choose between old flame Michael and new romance Greg. “It’s hard choosing whether to go with your heart or your head… it’s been hard,” she said, before choosing Irish rugby player Greg. 6575 Francesca savages Michael in her recoupling speechAfter Amber chose Greg, Francesca was left with only one man to choose from - Michael. She didn’t seem too happy to be left with the consolation prize: I’ve personally really struggled to find a connection with anyone here and as you’re an expert, I’m hoping that you might be able to teach me a few things,” she said to Michael. “I think you’re a great person, and I haven’t really got any other choice.”6675 Chris and Harley get closerChris and Harley shared their first kiss after Harley admitted that “funny can laugh you into bed.”6775 Michael and Francesca leave the villaIslanders decided that Michael and Francesca were the weakest of the bottom three couples and dumped them from the villa. Michael left on a good note with Amber, admitting he wasn’t “the nicest person” over the past few weeks and saying he was happy to see Amber getting on well with Greg. 6875 The Sidebar of Shame challenge rocks some couplesIslanders learned that newspaper headlines called Maura and Curtis’ relationship “staged,” that India was accused faking her affection for Ovie, and that “bored” Molly-Mae was accused faking both her love for Tommy and her happiness for Maura and Curtis. Chris put his foot in it when he said he thought that a headline about two Islanders being meant for each other was about him and India rather than Harley.6975 Jordan goes on a kamikaze missionDespite having asked Anna to be his girlfriend only two days before, Jordan decided his emerging romantic feelings for India were too powerful to ignore. On the advice of Curtis, he pulled India aside and began to confess his feelings, before Anna stormed over ready to give him a piece of his mind. Was it worth it? Well, Jordan found out that India definitely just sees him as a “mate.” Ouch. It didn’t take long before Anna was giving Jordan a dressing down, joined by Maura and Amber who were equally ready to lay into the lothario. “You ask a girl to be your girlfriend and the two days later you were hitting on her?” Anna yelled. “It’s disrespectful for her to be sitting over there like a god damned mug!” Amber added. “You’re a f*cking liar,” shouted Maura for good measure. 7175 Curtis lands in hot waterCurtis caught a lot of flak for advising Jordan to tell India how he feels without speaking to Anna first. Aside from some harsh words from Maura, Anna sat him down and told him he was a “narcissist,” saying “you move like you’re such a good person, but you’re not”.Anna, Jordan, Harley and Chris were all dumped from the villa following a public vote. Although she seemed glad to leave Jordan, Anna left Molly Mae, Amber and Maura in tears after she told them: “I’m so grateful for you three, because I feel like I found love with you guys.”7375 The couples go on their final datesHelicopter rides, yacht trips and candlelit dinners... the remaining five couples enjoyed their final dates in this particularly romantic episode. Tommy and Molly-Mae got serious over dinner, speaking about how they might even be ready to move in together.7475 \u0027Meet the parents\u0027In one of the most popular segments of the series, each contestant received a visit from members of their family – and got to introduce them to their respective partners. Cut to Curtis\u0027s mum being unable to say Maura (she kept saying Moira), Greg\u0027s mum giving Amber a shamrock necklace, and Anton\u0027s mum handing Belle a razor so she could continue shaving his arse. 7575 Anton and Belle get dumped before the finalPoor Anton. He didn\u0027t have much luck during Love Island, and even his relationship with Belle seemed pretty bland. But it was still a surprise – if only to him – when the couple were voted off by the public in the penultimate episode. We\u0027re fine, he\u0027d whispered confidently to Belle before the results were announced. Reader, they were not.This series has made headlines for perceived gaslighting in the villa, as well as issues surrounding consent and toxic relationships.Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury, the longest-running couple on this series, are tipped as the favourites to win the show.The Love Island final airs at 9pm on ITV2.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One of those, the furthest from the star, is thought to sit in the temperature range that could allow it to support alien life – but its atmosphere is expected to be so thick and dense that it stores lots of heat, and the surface is probably too warm.Scientists hope to learn more about the relatively nearby worlds. As well as being close by and playing host to such unusual worlds, the star is unusually bright, without the solar flares and storms that can sometimes get in the way of observations.TOI-270\u0026nbspis a true Disneyland for exoplanet science, and one of the prime systems\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspwas set out to discover, Gunther continued.NasaGoddard Space Flight CenterScott Wiessinger)It is an exceptional laboratory for not one, but many reasons –\u0026nbspit really ticks all the boxes.There might be yet more planets in this solar system waiting to be found, researchers said.While the planets are interesting enough in themselves, they also link together in a resonant chain, according to the researchers who found them. That means that their orbits are lined up neatly in whole integers, meaning that they are in resonance with each other.For\u0026nbspTOI-270, these planets line up like pearls on a string,\u0026nbspGunther\u0026nbspsays. That\u0027s a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical\u0026nbspbehaviour. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.Other solar systems have been found with planets that line up in these resonant formations. In our solar system, the moons of Jupiter are lined up in this interesting way, too.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What details there are usually come through unconfirmed leaks and the companies officially stay silent on the phones until they are released to the public.But this time around, Google appears to be selectively leaking details of the phone in advance of its release. It has already shown off pictures of what it will look like, and has now shown two of its central features.Today we’re giving you an early look at the technology behind two new features coming to Pixel 4 that make your phone more helpful and represent a next step in our vision for ambient computing, it wrote in a blog post that showed off two of the technologies.The first of those features is a new tool called Soli, which it described as a motion-sending radar.

Over time, new capabilities will come to the phone so that the feature – named Motion Sense by Google – can develop with new software.Such a feature had already been rumoured after some images of the outside of the phone had been leaked by third-parties. Those included a large hole in its front, which prompted speculation that it could fit the radar sensor used to power the Motion Sense feature.Google Pixel 4 leak shows hole for mysterious feature at top of phoneThe second feature is the ability for users to unlock their phone just by using their face. Such a feature is already available in products like the iPhone, but Google said it is engineering it differently.Unlike Apple\u0027s FaceID and other similar devices, Google claims the new phone will be able to use that motion sensing technology to see people are reaching down for the phone before they even touch it. That will be able to wake up the facial recognition sensors, which can then use algorithms to recognise someone as they pick up the phone – before it is even held up to their face.Google stressed that it would focus on security and privacy while designing those two features, and that the data would be kept secure even from Google\u0027s own servers.The blog post ended with a reference to the phone coming out later this year. The handset is expected around October, but Google has given no precise indication of when it will arrive.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The measurements indicate the largest singular release of radioactivity from a civilian reprocessing plant,” said Georg Steinhauser, one of the lead researchers from the University of Hannover.The data was taken from 176 measuring stations in 29 countries. Despite the high concentration of radioactive material it was not harmful to human health anywhere in Europe, according to the paper published in scientific journal\u0026nbspPNAS.\u0026nbspGermany’s green power generates more electricity than coal and nuclearKim Jong-un inspects submarine ‘designed to deliver nuclear weapons’It is not the first time the Mayak plant has made headlines.\u0026nbspAlmost exactly 60 years earlier, in 1957, the site suffered the world’s second most serious nuclear incident after Chernobyl when a tank containing liquid waste from plutonium production exploded and contaminated the area.\u0026nbspIt led to the release of radiation over an area of over 20,000 square miles. The accident remained secret until 1976.Professor Steinhauser said “This time, however, it was a pulsed release that was over very quickly.“We were able to show that the accident occurred in the reprocessing of spent fuel elements, at a very advanced stage, shortly before the end of the process chain,” he said.\u0026nbspThe present-day Mayak plant has been a target for activists, who say managers have not learned the lessons of the 1957 disaster. They claim the\u0026nbspincreased production targets have come at the cost of safety.“Even though there is currently no official statement, we have a very good idea of what might have happened,” Professor Steinhauser said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future. What we thought were flashbacks are, in fact, flash-forwards – her daughter is yet to be born.The set-up: Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) falsely accuses the housekeeper’s son (James McAvoy) of raping her cousin when she becomes jealous of his relationship with her older sister (Keira Knightley). He’s sent to prison, but is eventually freed to enlist in World War II – and the audience is told that he eventually rekindled his romance with Cecilia and lived happily ever after.The twist: Only, they didn’t. We learn that this is another lie from an older Briony – both Robbie and Cecilia died in the war.The set-up: Having been hired by Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband’s death, JJ Gittes (Jack Nicholson) discovers the existence of someone crucial to the case: Evelyn’s sister, Katherine. The twist: After being confronted by Gittes, Evelyn reveals that Katherine is also her daughter – and the result of being raped by her father when she was 15.The set-up: IRA member Fergus (Stephen Rea) promises to protect Dil (Jaye Davidson), the girlfriend of a soldier his group has imprisoned, and soon begins an unexpected relationship with her. The twist: Dil is transgender, and was born male. Fergus\u0027s love for her sees him take the fall for a shooting she commits.The set-up: Having awoken in a bathtub, and discovering he has telekinetic abilities, John Murdoch attempts to find the truth behind a dystopian world that’s inhabited by an evil group who can stop time and implant memories.The twist: His search for meaning sees him reach the end of the city. With nowhere left to go, he breaks through a wall and finds the city is actually an island floating through outer space.The set-up: Cop Frank Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) infiltrates the organisation of gang chief Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) at the same time that criminal Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) infiltrates the police force – and both soon suspect they have spies in their midst.The twist: Both end up dead. A shocking sequence sees Sullivan kill Costigan who believes he\u0027s got away with it. Sergeant Sean Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) sees to that in an equally as shocking climactic scene.The set-up: A woman named Christina is enlisted into murdering her husband by his mistress. However, once the deed is done, his body disappears.The twist: Her husband faked his death with the help of his mistress. The pair wanted to make Christina believe she committed the murder in an attempt to destroy her.The set-up: Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is trained by Obi Wan Kenobi and Jedi master Yoda to defeat the evil Darth Vader, leading to the showdown of all showdowns.The twist: Skywalker’s delivered a blow after making a pretty huge discovery: the villain is his father. Cue shock and awe.The set-up: The world of the film’s insomniac narrator (Edward Norton) collides with that of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) as they start an underground club that permits ordinary people to have fistfights with one another.The twist: The narrator and Tyler are dissociated personalties – AKA they are the same person.The set-up: Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) flees after agreeing to participate in a twisted game that sees him – among other things – buried alive and contemplating suicide after accidentally murdering his brother. The twist: It really was just a game the entire time, set up by his brother who wasn\u0027t killed at all.The set-up: Rose (Allison Williams), a white woman, brings her black boyfriend Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) home to meet her family.

It emerges that these imposters are mental home patients who murdered the couple, and have now taken up residence in their house.

While experiencing visions of her daughter, who we learn died from cancer in her teens, Louise attempts to communicate with the race in a bid to discern the purpose of their visit.The twist: Louise deciphers the language, which gives her the ability to see into the future.

And with the film now largely regarded as something of a cult classic, and certainly one of the most daringly weird comic book adaptations of the last 30 years, it’s interesting to take a look back at the first responses to the film upon its release. Here are just a small sample...“Lean, mean and green, The Mask is unquestionably a money-making movie machine. But there’s nothing mechanical or rote about the offbeat romantic adventure. This showcase for the talents of Jim Carrey is adroitly directed, viscerally and visually dynamic and just plain fun. The box office will be booming just like the title character’s heart, and the film should easily emerge as one of the year’s biggest commercial successes.”\u0026nbspLeonard Klady, Variety“The Mask taps Jim Carrey’s antic energy and Play-Doh pliability, fortifies these with animated alchemy and, alakazam, the star is transformed into Gumby on paint fumes. Effectively, the comic actor becomes one with a Tex Avery-type ‘toon in a series of sequences that are literally jaw-dropping. But these loopy-doopy interludes aside, there’s little else to recommend this slight comic variation on Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”\u0026nbspRita Kempley, Washington Post“Crowds won’t flock to The Mask for subtlety. They want to see Carrey play monkey boy and go bananas. That he does, especially in a free-for-all climax that pulls out all the stops in head-spinning hilarity. Even when the gags are laboured, Carrey stays light on his feet. This gifted clown has found the right vehicle for his souped-up silliness. Carrey is the ultimate party dude, and like the masked man says, this party is smokin’.”\u0026nbspPeter Travers, Rolling StoneAnna Nicole Smith was nearly cast in The Mask instead of Cameron DiazFirst trailer drops for Sonic the Hedgehog“Not only is he adept at physical humour, the kind of knockabout stuff that recalls the classic silent clowns, but Carrey also has a bright and likeable screen presence, a lost puppy quality that is surprisingly endearing.”\u0026nbspKenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times“Cameron Diaz is a true discovery in the film, a genuine sex bomb with a gorgeous face, a wonderful smile, and a gift of comic timing. This is her first movie role, after a brief modelling career. It will not be her last. Her chemistry with the Carrey character holds together a plot that is every bit as derivative as it can be, and when she dances with the Mask the result is one of those scenes when movie magic really works.”\u0026nbspRoger Ebert, Chicago Sun-TimesWith Diaz propelled to superstar status as a result of the film, and becoming one of the most bankable and highest-paid actors by the turn of the 21st century, it is Ebert’s review that proved to be\u0026nbspthe most prescient of all.Dumb and Dumber\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She also talked about the trauma of getting pregnant and having a child, who is now four months old, as a result of the sexual assault.The British government was earlier this month ordered by the High Court\u0026nbspto help her return to the UK on the grounds that its decision to reject her asylum claim had been unlawful,\u0026nbspbecause it was reached by an unfair process which did not give her sufficient time to obtain evidence.She is one of thousands of asylum seekers whose immigration cases were decided under the Home Office’s “detained fast-track” system, which was introduced in 2005 and came to an end in 2015 after the High Court ruled that it was “structurally unfair”.Gay woman wrongly removed from UK ‘gang-raped and feared for her life’The Home Office had booked her\u0026nbsponto a flight just after 4am on Monday, but she\u0026nbspsaid that when she arrived at the check-in she was told she could not board without written evidence that she didn’t require a visa – which she had not been provided with.\u0026nbspThe department said it had been working urgently to resolve the matter and PN was due to board a later flight on Tuesday night.Speaking to The Independent, PN said: “They said I needed something to prove I had a visa waiver. But the High Commission and the Home Office never told me I needed anything. I had nothing to show from the Home Office. They should have got somebody to speak to the people at the airport, something to show them. I don’t know why they didn’t do that.“I had to go back home. I haven’t slept at all. I keep asking myself why have they done this to me. It’s giving me headaches because I’m thinking too much. I can’t even eat, I can’t drink, because I don’t know why this has happened.“I was in the airport, I was happy. I saw the flight. I knew I was going back. Now I feel so afraid.\u0026nbspI don’t even want to move from my bedroom. I don’t want to leave. I’m scared people will know who I am. I just want to get out of this mess. I’m tired of it.”PN, whose full name cannot be disclosed for legal reasons, arrived in the UK in 2011 and claimed asylum on the basis that she was a lesbian and would be at risk of persecution in Uganda. But this was refused and she was removed in 2013 because the Home Office did not believe she was gay.The Home Office has been ordered to facilitate her return to the UK, but is set to appeal the decision, meaning PN faces the prospect of being sent back to Uganda again if the department is successful.Karen Doyle, national organiser of Movement for Justice, a group which has been supporting PN financially since she was removed to Uganda, said: “Being turned away from the flight was frightening and devastating for PN. Having to make her way back to her room in the early hours of the morning after hours in the airport full of anticipation and hope she would be safe in the UK today.“Once again the home office have shown their lack of care and concern for her\u0026nbspsafety. This latest blow for PN is emblematic of the delays, appeals and blocks the Home Office have put in place ever since the order for her return on 24\u0026nbspJune.“It is not acceptable and the Home Office must do everything they can to put this right and get PN out of Uganda.”PN’s return (Phillip Raymond Goodman)It comes as\u0026nbspmore than 400 people staged a protest outside the Home Office building, calling on Priti Patel, the\u0026nbspnew home secretary, to\u0026nbspend the “hostile environment” and deportations.Lucille from the All African Women’s\u0026nbspGroup, a self-help group of women asylum seekers and immigrants, many of whom have been detained in Yarl’s Wood, said: “As women, we suffer particularly from the hostile environment because we are poorer to begin with, are often traumatised from rape and other violence and because we are often mothers with responsibility for other precious human beings.“We face a sexist, racist Home Office and companies that profit from deportation.\u0026nbspWe demand an end to the hostile environment, to detention, destitution and deportations and an end to the separation of families.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just standard food it seems.And last month, a cannibal seagull was seen feasting on another gulls corpse in Devon.Others have been spotted eating pigeons live in front of horried diners in Cornwall and greedily swallowing a chick whole off the Northumberland coast after snatching it from its mum.But its not just birds blood that gulls have acquired a taste for.Boozy seagulls have been spotted falling off rooftops, stumbling around and even vomiting on people after drinking the dregs of pint glasses across the UK.It turns out, like the rest of us, they cant cope with too much of the stuff . This month, a group of gulls were spotted making the most of half-empty wine and beer bottles left behind on a Bournemouth beach by louts along with a bottle of urine.But on other occasions, theyve viciously swiped booze out of revellers hands.Fiona Heath, from Glasgow, Scotland, was gutted when a gull pinched her wine, writing on Twitter: A seagull just came and drank my wine knocked over my wine glass.Sharing a crying emoji, she added: No more wine for me.The RSPCA, who treated nearly  sozzled birds in just two weeks last year, said the creatures initially appeared to have a disease - but then, after vomiting, most seem to recover.“The birds absolutely stink of alcohol when we collect them so now our vans smell like pubs, charity officer Jo Daniel said at the time of the initial drunken outbreak last summer.Footage, shared by the animal welfare organisation, shows a boozed-up gull tottering backwards, in scenes that will trigger déjà vu for anyone whos had one too many shots.Firefighter watch manager Virgil Turner went to rescue a drunken seagull in Dorset and was vomited on.He told Devon Live: “When we arrived he [the gull] had already fallen off the roof, he was sitting shaking his head and he then tried to fly and he nearly hit me in the face.I caught him and he threw up all over me and he reeked of beer.It is suspected the gulls had consumed brewing waste.And in recent weeks, many gulls have been tanked up for another reason - the huge swarms of insects invading UK cities as part of the Flying Ant Day phenomenon.The ants - who venture out of their nests at this time of year to hunt for a mate - contain formic acid, which stupefies seagulls and causes them to act like theyre on LSD.Gulls have been seen going crazy in the skies, swooping on to dual carriageways, and reportedly acting more violently. Some have even been hit and killed by unsuspecting drivers.The increasingly aggressive nature of British seagulls has come under the spotlight recently - with reports of dead dogs, pensioners pecked on the head and a postman left shaken by repeated attacks.Adult seagulls also become incredibly protective at this time of year as their chicks get ready to flee the nest.Its thought that the phenomenon is provoked by wet weather followed by hot, humid conditions - but boffins have suggested it might not be as predictable as first thought.Flying Ant Day occurs when the ants sprout their wings and head off on whats known as a nuptial flight.During this time, the insects look around to find a mate, before landing to start a new colony.Queen ants emerge from the nest to begin their nuptial flight with the male ants usually flying alongside.The most common type of wflying ant is the black garden iety . Hose nests have a single queen and anything from , to , workers.Councils as far inland as Worcestershire have even hired gull control officers to help keep the birds at bay, while some have called for a cull of the vicious flying rats.Conservative councillor Alan Amos told Sun Online last week that we need a nationwide gull cull to tackle the problem. The Isle of Wight rescue organisation Wild Bird Aid posted images of six dead gulls on Facebook, saying it witnessed a driver purposefully drive over one of them.The RSPB says that, by law, you cant kill or try to control gulls without a licence. People who do so can face up to six months in prison or a £, fine.Recently, drivers were seen deliberately aiming for gulls - which are a protected species - as the boozed-up birds flew around dual carriageways.  This time they werent high on alcohol, but flying ants. It is thought the ants formic acid reacts in the gulls stomach, making them appear drunk and more aggressive.It comes as the hunt for chihuahua Gizmo, snatched from his owners garden in Paignton, continues - with The Sun offering a £, reward for anyone who finds the pup.Devastated owner Rebecca Hill said: I’m really grateful to The Sun and its readers for trying to find Gizmo. I can’t explain how painful it is to lose my ‘baby’ in such an awful way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One Labour MP predicts Boris will “wipe the floor” with Corbyn.Panic has set in with Irish leader Leo Varadkar too, ramping up his rhetoric now we have a PM who means business.No Deal will cause Dublin such chaos that the EU intends to let them waive border checks. So much for the “backstop” being vital to avoid a hard border. In the end they’ll just make checks away from the border, as Eurosceptics said.Our new Cabinet, meanwhile, fizzes with energy and resolve. Long may it last.And while a suicide squad of Tory Remoaners may still fancy forcing an election to avoid No Deal, that threat looks far less potent than a week ago.WE despair of our police.Yes, they are short-staffed. That is obviously partly to blame for kne crime soaring to record highs. We back the , cops the Tories aim to recruit.But then “hard-pressed” bobbies build a huge tower of hats in a juvenile social media contest. And the Met commissions a spray-painter to daub a nick with cartoons bearing banal messages.Some forces have given up on burglaries, blaming cuts. The Met often seems to have given up on even more serious crime. Yet the stunts and virtue-signalling keep coming. And police chiefs seem too dim to grasp how bad it looks.New policing minister Kit Malthouse is focused on recruitment. But he must also lay down the law about ato basic crime-fighting and detection.Plus a ban on social media posts that do nothing for the public but enrage it.IT began with Jews. Now Labour’s race hatred extends to black and ethnic minority people who vote the “wrong” way.Look how they are targeting BAME Cabinet members. Clive Lewis MP, an acolyte of anti-Semite Corbyn, tells black Tory chairman James Cleverly he “sold his soul” to serve “a racist PM”.A Corbynite “journalist” says politicians like Sajid Javid and Priti Patel are “no longer a person of colour. They are a turncoat of colour”.Labour has no time for BAME people it cannot deploy as victims of Tory “oppression”. If they reject that victimhood, vote Conservative or, worse, have the talent to reach the top of a Tory Government, they are not “properly” BAME.Such is the poison of “identity politics” spread by Corbyn and his cult of hate-filled halfwits.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of .

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in.

I mean how do you choke yourself  It doesnt make any sense.There are reports someone came after him but that could just be because hes a paedophile. Those types of iniduals dont last long in prison.If Epstein is in general population or anywhere available to the general population I believe his le is in jeopardy.They will have to seal him down in the jail. But even there there are still people who can get to him, ultimately.Epstein has been locked up in the Manhattan jail ahead of a trial for charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls.He is accused of sexually exploiting and abusing dozens of minor girls at his homes in ious locations.Documents claim Epstein would pay girls hundreds of dollars to perform sex acts with him and would also pay certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused.Epstein was also arrested on similar charges in  but managed to obtain a lenient sweetheart plea deal in which he only served  months in jail.Now Kuvin speculated whether Epstein would even survive until his upcoming trial.He likened the Epstein case to the Profumo affair - a  British scandal in which politician John Profumo was forced to resign after having an affair with a -year-old showgirl called Christine Keeler.Profumo met Keeler through his friend socialite Stephen Ward who introduced many rich and powerful men to beautul women. Ward was subsequently put on trial for immorality offences - but killed himself before the verdict was announced.There are a lot of similarities between what happened in the Profumo affair and the Epstein case, Kuvin said.We know that Mr Ward, who was involved in that affair and the procurement of women for some notable people, was given bail and committed suicide while out on bail - so it’ll be interesting to see whether or not Mr Epstein attempts again to get out on bail andhe does whether he survives between now and the date of his trial.I also find it interesting that we had allegations as far back as then that there was apparently masked men attending parties with Ward - sex parties - among these circles of famous friends.Then we have Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein who are also circulating in these very powerful, very influential circles - it definitely shows the underbelly of the rich and famous and what they do in their private lives for entertainment.These sex parties and orgies and odd things dating back even to the s and s - seem to be repeating themselves on a grand scale.The rich and powerful think they are beyond the law and they end up doing things that are beyond the law. You can see it with the Profumo affair and you can see it here. - Charged with multiple counts of unlawful sexual acts with a minor. - Epstein’s lawyers put together a plea deal for Epstein, who was the .He agreed to plead guilty to two felony prostitution charges in state court,In exchange, he and his accomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for le. - Appears in court to plead guilty on two lesser counts and sentenced to a  months in jail and was released early in July  - Arrested charges of child sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.Prosecutors accused him in a grand jury indictment of paying dozens of girls as young as  to engage in sex acts with him at his New York and Florida properties from  to .Pleaded not guilty and could face up to  years in prisonconvicted.More than a dozen women have now come forward with more sex abuse allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"pub facebook advert ex steak","story":"MPs have joined punters in slamming The George in Stockton after it posted the question on Facebook with a photo of a huge slab of meat.Alex Cunningham, MP for Stockton North said on Twitter: Its completely unacceptable language and the owner should take it down immediately.My office is reporting it to the police.Police and crime commissioner Barry Coppinger also tweeted: Not only is a post like this in bad taste, but it risks normalising violence in intimate relationships and violence against women and girls.Im sure the author of this post is aware of the links between the night time economy and serious violence, particularly domestic violence.Owner Craig Harker has remained defiant about the post from Saturday and told those complaining to live a little.This is about what someone would do for steak and the majority of the response is positive, he told The Sun Online.Yes we get criticised by the PC brigade but you cant say anything these days without upsetting someone.The Georges Facebook page frequently mocks healthy eating and even offers free food to morbidly obese customers.We are the most caloric pub in the UK and we stand by our fantastic food and menu as well as the marketing campaigns, Mr Harker said.This isnt Weight Watchers,you want a cheat day or week then come and see us to pile on those pounds.He continued: We are all grown ups and have choices how to take things and what we choose to eat, instead of abusing our Facebook page maybe the ones complaining should go outside, smell the roses, spend time with loved ones and just live a little.The upset comes just two years after the same pub was rapped for a similar ad asking: Would you punch your ex in the face for a parmo The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the words referred to domestic violence and was likely to cause serious offence.The George is due to reopen on Wednesday after a fire destroyed much of the building and has promised to provide its most unhealthy menu yet when it does.Domestic violence campaigner David Challen, whose mum Sally Challen was released from prison last month after the Old Bailey ruled out a retrial for killing her abusive husband in a hammer attack following decades of emotional abuse, hit out at the County Durham pub.He wrote on Twitter: “So wait, he did this in , got told off, said sorry in a video and did it again recently  ”Facebook user Adele Knapp added: “Some people would take this literally not everyone would take it as a joke.“It may be a joke but it’s a bit of a sick joke to be honest.Shadow Women and Equalities Minister Carolyn Harris has likewise condemned the advert as totally unacceptable.For this landlord to trivialise violence is both crass and deplorable, she said.This must be stopped and appropriate action taken against the person responsible.A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: “Police have been notied of the content of the poster and officers are looking into whether any offences may have been committed.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000509518336-e1564406427575.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;h=192\u0026amp;crop=1\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rail__item-content\"\u003e\u003ch3 class=\"rail__item-headline t-p-color\"\u003eHORRIFIC DEATH\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cspan class=\"rail__item-sub\"\u003e Boy, 6, dead after \u0026#x27;pals put nozzle up bum \u0026amp;

So this isn’t about some kind of barter.This is about the international law and the rules of the international legal system being upheld and that is what we will insist on.He later told Sky News: If the Iranians want to come of the dark and be accepted as a responsible member of the intentional community they need to adhere to rules-based system of the international community."},{"url":null,"title":"council advice seagulls nesting towel chain","story":"Britain has seen a rise in horror gull attacks in recent weeks, with a -year-old pensioner savaged just yards from his home near Morecambe Bay in Lancs.Devastated chihuahua owner Rebecca Hill is still searching for her pet Gizmo in Devon after he was seen being snatched by one of the hated seabirds.Despite the real threat they pose, Shepway District Council in Folkestone has issued some questionable advice on how residents can tackle the pesky birds.An Advice on Seagulls online booklet reads: Discourage birds by disturbing them as often as possible as they show signs of nesting in March.A rope or chain attached or hung near the site which can be shaken and rattled frequently might work in this way.Residents are also encouraged to shake towels or white cloths out of window to scare or deter the birds.However, they state this must be done regularly until the birds have got the message and flown away.One bemused local was first irked by a snowflake sign in the seaside town telling visitors not to feed the birds.The sign includes a photo of a seagull and says from the birds perspective that feeding encourages me to steal food and can make me aggressive towards humans.She told The Sun Online: It struck me as a bit of a snowflake-approach to dealing with these flying aggressors.When I looked on the Folkestone and Hythe council website I saw that they have even more ridiculous guidelines for the birds  - like stop them from nesting on your house by waving a white towel at them, or shaking a chain attached to your roof!The unusual advice comes just two months ago after two fire engines raced to rescue a seagull trapped on a chimney pot in the seaside town.The number of seagulls has soared four-fold over the past  years and concern for the safety of pets and other targets is growing.John Woodcock, MP for Barrow and Furness, is calling for gull contraceptives in a bid to halt the blighters.[We dont want] this situation where people are terrorised going into their houses, hospitals and schools, he told ITVs This Morning today.

And she’s appeared on The Apprentice. While performing a fitness test to qualy for a charity horse race, she lost control of her bladder. “I was doing my ‘bleep test’ where you run back and forth between two beeps which get faster and faster and honestly I had no control,” admits the -year-old from Herts. “I wet myself to the point you could see it. It was a full-on wet patch front and back, in front of  people – including a television film crew with the cameras rolling.    “That was one of the most ­embarrassing things that has ever happened to me, but I’m competitive so I didn’t want to stop running because I didn’t want to fail. All I could say was ‘I’ve had three kids!’. “I just had to try to front it out and said, ‘Guys, we’ve all seen Paula Radclfe do it on TV’. I had worn two pairs of pants and a pad and it still came through.” Luisa first experienced urinary incontinence when she was ­pregnant with her third child, ­Clementine, who is now  months. “I had morning sickness and when I puked I would pee myself. At the time I thought it was the weight of the baby, but about three months after she was born I got a sickness bug and it happened again. “I think having a third baby tipped me over the edge. After Dixie, who is nine, I was fine but I got pregnant with Clementine when my second baby, Indigo, was only five months and she was the trickiest birth. She got stuck and the consultant had to manipulate her to get her out. “I don’t knowmy problem is caused by trauma or just having two consecutive babies very quickly, but now whether I’m sneezing, laughing or running I pee myself. The only forms of exercise I can do without wetting myself are Pilates and horse riding.”   It’s a relief for the Celebrity Big Brother star that she hasn’t had to give up her horse due to the problem – she’s been riding since she was four and this August is taking part in the Magnolia Cup, a charity horse race at Goodwood, to raise funds for Wellbeing of Women.“I’m proud to be racing for an amazing charity,” she says. “They do loads of research into urinary incontinence and chatting about my issue has been really interesting. From what I heard when I visited their offices, Botox might even be able to help me.” Luisa is certainly not alone. Incontinence is a signicant issue for ­approximately three million women in the UK. Six weeks after pregnancy, % of women report urinary ­incontinence and one in three will suffer from it at some point. “I’m quite open about my problem now and just say, ‘Oh my God, I’m peeing’I have an accident around friends. I feel like loads of women actually suffer but don’t talk about it. “Once, while making my podcast, Loose Lips, I laughed so much that my co-host Anna Williamson thought I’d lost control of my bowels as well. But I had peed so much it had made my fake tan run, which had stained my clothes. I had to go and change.” Luisa has used several gadgets to try and solve the problem, “I used this manual Kegel exerciser and one which was a bit like a ­Slendertone. You insert it and it ­electrocutes the muscles but that put me right off so I only used it a couple of times,” she says. And now she is only just starting to have medical investigations to get to the bottom of her issues.

Tragically, this kind of treatment is far from unusual. An investigation by animal welfare charities found at least three quarters of zoos and aquariums force their beasts to interact with visitors. They also found lions and tigers forced to perform in shows in ‘gladiatorial’ ampitheatres to entertain large crowds and dolphins used as surfboards by their keepers. Elephants were poked with sticks to force them to play basketball, perform tricks, and give visitors rides. Chimpanzees and orangutans were made to wear nappies and human clothes, ride scooters, and kiss tourists as they posed for photographs.    The charities are now urging tourists to boycott zoos and aquariums that use cruel training methods to force their animals to interact with humans in this way, often causing lasting harm.Audrey Mealia, from World Animal Protection , said: “Seeing wild animals being used purely as circus acts and photos props was more like a horror show.“These ridiculous activities should be a thing of the past.”The new report, The Show Can’t Go On, has been published by World Animal Protection and the Change For Animals Foundation .The charities visited  animal parks across five continents, including attractions in America, Canada, France, Portugal, and Japan. They also examined how animals were used and treated at , zoos around the globe that are affiliated to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums .    They found % offered visitors the chance to pet the animals, % allowed tourists to walk or swim through the animals’ enclosures, while % used their animals in live shows. Meanwhile, % allowed visitors to hand-feed the animals, while % allowed tourists to ride the animals. This fails to meet WAZA guidelines, which state that modern zoos and aquariums should not participate in animal shows or interactive experiences where animals perform unnatural behaviours. Dr Neil D’Cruze, global wildle advisor at World Animal Protection, said: “Seeing wild animals perform in circus-like shows or pose for photographs is not just a bit of fun. “What might be seen as an enjoyable activity on a day out for the family actually means a letime of suffering for these animals. Cruel and demeaning visitor attractions have no place in any modern zoo or aquarium.” The report did not identy major issues at any UK zoos or aquariums that are members of WAZA.    However, the charities warned that many British tourists would choose to visit parks in other countries which were affiliated with WAZA, either directly or indirectly through national associations, because they wrongly believed that guaranteed the animals were humanely treated. The report advises people not to visit any park that allows visitors to ride, touch, or bathe a wild animals, uses animals as props for photographs or as performers in circus-style shows, or makes animals dress or behave in an unnatural way. Training wild animals to interact with people and perform in shows often involves poking them with sticks, starving them to use food as a reward, or withdrawing social interaction for species like dolphins and elephants which normally live in family groups.    Conditions in zoos that are not affiliated to WAZA can be even worse and the parks may be linked to the illegal wildle trade, the charities warned. Harry Eckman, Director, Change for Animals Foundation, said: “All of these ridiculous activities represent a clear and present danger to the wild animals involved. “Circus-like shows and elephant rides typically involve harsh training methods to establish dominance and the use of wild animals as photo props can inflict stress and injuries. “UK tourists can make a stand by not visiting or supporting these venues. This will send out a clear message – that treating animals in this way is not acceptable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"darren lewis sensible ozil who","story":"NewsopinionDarren Lewis: Sensible Ozil who placed safety above property should be praisedPraise for the Arsenal footballer Sead Kolasinac, who took on two kne-wielding thugs during an attempted robbery last week, grates so heavily - because le is too cheap to thugsShareCommentsByDarren Lewis:,  JUL NewsopinionMesut Ozil did what every parent advises their children to do - make a sharp, safe exit \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA week ago a close friend had their family car stolen from outside their house.

Paul Bussetti is accused of sending a grossly offensive video on WhatsApp and causing footage of a menacing character to be uploaded on YouTube. The -year-old, from South Norwood, south east London, wearing a grey suit and an open-necked white shirt, sat in the dock as the footage he filmed was played to Westminster Magistratesapos Court. Laughter could be heard on the video as the model was placed on the bonfire and set alight on November  last year.  Opening the trial, prosecutor Philip Stott said Bussetti had been attending a friendaposs bonfire and that approximately  people had been there. Various people had brought guys or effigies, he said, including someone other than the defendant who brought a model tower block with Grenfell Tower written on it. Mr Stott said it had characters on it, some inside, some hanging off it as though they were falling. He added: Some of these appeared to be black or brown.  A comment can be heard on the video referring to a ninja, which Mr Stott said the prosecution believes referred to a figure on the tower which was all in black and wearing a niqab. The defendant voluntarily attended Croydon police station two days after the bonfire, by which time footage of the incident had been widely shared online and featured on the news. The court heard that Bussetti told police he had no idea why he had filmed the incident and sent it to two WhatsApp groups, which had a total of around  members. In interview comments to officers which were read to the court, he added: One of those stupid moments. He said: It was just sick. There was no purpose. It was just a horrible video. Bussetti said he had not intended the video to go viral and that it did not support any agenda.  He said: Not going to blame it on the drink, I donapost know why I done it but I didnapost think they would broadcast it. It was just stupidness really, everyone had a drink but, yeah, it was just complete stupidness. Asked how he felt after seeing it, he said sick, not good, terrible. By the time he went to the police, Bussetti had deleted the video from his phone, but it could be seen on another group memberaposs phone that he had sent it to the groups.  The blaze at the block of flats in west London on June   killed  people. While Bussetti does not dispute filming the footage and sharing it to the two WhatsApp groups, it is disputed by his legal team that it was grossly offensive to send it to the private groups. His lawyer Mark Summers QC has also argued that he did not intend for it to end up on YouTube, where it was uploaded by someone . A victim impact statement from Sandra Ruiz, the aunt of Grenfell fire victim Jessica Urbano Ramirez, , was then read to the court.  She said: I could not believe what I was seeing in the video. I had never really experienced anything like this before. It felt like the hate was being directed personally at me, as part of the Grenfell community. Ms Ruiz quoted a comment from one unknown bonfire partygoer who said: That is what happens when you donapost pay your rent. She said: I found this comment revolting. Jessica was told repeatedly to stay in the tower and the video made a mockery of her death. Knowing that my niece was in there and that her fate was unknown for a long time will stay with me forever. Bussetti, of Sundial Avenue, denies the two charges against him.

I was trying to blend in, to keep up with the pace of these seasoned professionals, and to learn as much as I could as quickly as possible, she said. Meghan has also revealed her Vogue journey was inspired by quote in a book she read many moons ago called The Four-Chambered Heart, by Anaïs Nin “I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.”  She added: For this issue, I imagined, why would we swim in the shallow end of the pool when we could go to the deep end  A metaphor for le, as well as for this issue. Let’s be braver. Let’s go a bit deeper. That’s what Edward and I have aimed to achieve. An issue of both substance and levity. Describing what readers can expect in the issue, she continued: Throughout these pages you’ll find Commonwealth designers, ethical and sustainable brands, as well as features with designers not about clothes but about heritage, history and heirloom. You’ll also find a beauty section that puts its energy towards internal beauty, celebrating the power of breathing and meditation, and a favourite workout that urges you to use your heart as much as your core.  As you flip the pages, you’ll find familiar faces and names that I hope you get to know a bit better, a bit more deeply, even. And there are less familiar names that you may want to know, such as the women of Luminary Bakery and Tessa Clarke, co-founder of food-sharing app Olio, whom I met with discreetly last year. There are inspiring reads from Brené Brown and Jameela Jamil. You’ll also find a very special piece with Dr Jane Goodall, interviewed by my husband, and a candid and heartfelt conversation between myself and the extraordinary Michelle Obama. But more than anything, this issue is about the power of the collective. In identying our personal strengths, it is anchored in the knowledge that we are even stronger together.  The Duchess admitted there is one caveat in the magazine. It’s still a business, after all, she said.  I share that to manage expectations for you: there will be advertising sections that are requisite for every issue, so while I feel confident that you’ll feel my thumbprint on most pages, please know that there are elements that just come with the territory. The overall sentiment I hope you’ll find, however, will be one of positivity, kindness, humour and inclusivity. I was about five months pregnant when this process began, and by the time you hold this issue in your hands, my husband and I will be holding our three-month-old baby boy in ours.

The photo, which has since gone viral on Facebook, shows two white baskets loaded with goodies and a drink dispenser filled with orange squash, Manchester Evening News reports.Though some praised the mother for her witty thinking, other parents were quick to slam her for lazy parenting. Other critics lashed out at her choices of snacks, while others said the children should not be allowed to splurge and help themselves. In her original post, Shannon, wrote: Six week holiday survival kit. One of the hardest times of the holidays is the kids asking for drinks   snacks every  mins so with this idea they can help themselves.    The baskets will be refilled every morning but once it’s gone it’s gone so hopefully this will teach them not to be too greedy and a have bit of independence. Of course this is alongside breakfast, lunch and dinner and fruit is always available for them to help themselves to. After receiving widespread backlash over the post, Shannon edited it, adding: I won’t repeat myself again! I put this up to try and be helpful, never did I expect it to blow up and me being judged as aposlazy parentapos. I filled the basket with everything I bought as an example for the photo, they will not be getting this much each day - however yes some days they may so shoot me.    Also as stated below there is fruit that they are more then welcome to have and have no cap on hence why it’s not in the basket. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the -year-old said: It’s so crazy how much this post has blown up. People shouldnapost be so cruel and judgemental to people behind a screen, their words can be so damaging.

She was also unable to go swimming because she couldnapost get her eyebrows wet. I didnapost know whether to laugh or cry, horried Colline said.

Colline claimed that the worker told her she was sorry and she had messed up. I was in hysteria, crying aposIs anyone going to fix this apos she added. She said another beautician stepped in and offered to fix the waxing disaster. Colline says she was told a bit of tint would help, to which she agreed.    But when she sat up for a second time to look, she said it looked like two thick black slugs had been drawn above her eyes. Colline started to cry and stormed out of the salon and FaceTimed her sister Paula, who was horried by the freakish eyebrows. She tried desperately to wipe the black dye off with wet wipes in her car, but it was too late because the dye had dried and her drawn-on monster brows wouldnapost budge. Because her eyebrows has been waxed, the fix-up job applied the dye straight to her skin. Colline said she had an allergic reaction and her face swelled.Desperate Colline put a post up on Facebook begging for help to fix her botched brows.Iaposm known for being happy-go-lucky and always joking and doing pranks, but I didnapost know what  to do, she said.

He travelled more than  miles on Friday with his we, -year-old daughter, her best friend, and their -year-old son. But they say they were disgusted to find grease dripping down the walls of their chalet, rusty hobs, dirty floors and surfaces, cobwebs strung along the ceilings, and mouldy curtains.It was horrendous, Lloyd told Bristol Live .I wouldnapost even let my worst enemyaposs dog stay there, it was awful. I know you hear it all the time, but I really do think it was the holiday from hell.    We opened the door and just couldnapost believe what we were seeing, it was absolutely disgusting. My we was in tears, my daughter was in tears, the place looked like it hadnapost been cleaned in weeks. Itaposs not like I booked the room expecting the Ritz - we knew it was going to be a little bit rough around the edges, but at the very least you expect some basic level of cleanliness. We were told that cleaners go into the chalet at the end of every stay, but there were cobwebs up there that must have been there for weeks. Shocking photos taken in the chalet show cobwebs on lighting, grease marks on walls and mould on curtains. The family was eventually given a dferent room, also said to be filthy, and so eventually a third one was allocated.    A cleaning crew came out to do a sweep of the chalet and make sure it was clean, Lloyd, of Lincolnshire, said. My we and I were sitting outside when another couple walked over and said aposoh look, theyaposre cleaning our chaletapos. I immediately said that it was ours - it turns out they had also been given a set of keys for the same chalet by reception, who must have double-booked it. That immediately made me conscious about security - my son had brought his Nintendo Switch and we had a couple of iPads and a tablet with us, so right from the first evening it just didnapost feel secure. Lloyd believes he was right to be concerned about security - he said that over the course of the six-night stay a total of three couples were handed identical keys which could have accessed the chalet.    I didnapost want to risk it, so I spent a lot of the time near the chalet just making sure everything was secure, said Lloyd, who is disabled and was supposed to be enjoying his first relaxing break in eight years with his family after a long spell of health issues and the recent loss of a close friend. In the end I only managed to actually enjoy one day with my family, which was when we went to Weston-super-Mare to sit out on the beach. This was supposed to be quality time spent together, but as a result of the place being so dirty and insecure, it meant I was constantly on edge. On the sixth morning of the stay, Lloyd said his we woke up with a huge bite on her foot that became so swollen the family had to make a trip to the hospital due to their fears of a serious infection. The family eventually ended up leaving the holiday park one night early. Over the course of their visit Lloyd filled out six customer solutions forms - the first step of Pontinsapos complaints procedure - but claims he was not contacted at all until he got in touch with head office directly.

And now weaposre joining in. Sam Brook works at Sainsburyaposs in Bath and realised the scheme - which supports local communities through a wide range of initiatives put forward by each store - could help make shopping a far more straightforward experience for the  million deaf or hard of hearing people in the UK. That is why Sainsburyaposs colleagues turned their Bath store into a aposSignsburyapossapos for four days earlier this month.  With the new spelling applied to the sign above the door,  colleagues from the Bath Sainsburyaposs learned how to sign several common words and phrases when interacting with customers. That meant they were able to greet anyone at the door, askthey have a Nectar Card or even discuss the weather. This video explains the whole campaign:  We were so impressed by the idea, we decided to join up with the initiative and learn some sign language ourselves. In the video at the top of the page, you can see Daily Mirror columnist Eva Simpson getting a beginneraposs guide to signing from Sainsburyaposs Jonty Parry, finding out how to sign five key phrases that should allow anyone to communicate more easily with someone deaf. The speed with which Eva was able to pick up the phrases shows how easy it is to learn just a few useful bits of sign language - and how valuable that could be when it comes to having a chat with someone who is hard of hearing. About , deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language. British Sign Language isnapost a simple duplication of spoken English. It has its own syntax and grammar, and the order is dferent.  E.g. In English, you would say ‘What is your name ’ In BSL, you would say ‘Your name what ’There isnapost a universal sign language.  There are over  recorded sign languages.For example, American Sign Language is not the same as British Sign Language.  ASL alphabet is one handed, and BSL is two handed. In fact, there are so many dferent versions of sign language across the globe, you can here see how Happy Christmas is signed in  dferent countries!   Paul Robertson, the store manager at Bath, explained that was the exact idea behind aposSignsburyapossapos. “I thought it was the perfect time to use the opportunity to explore new ways to make our store more deaf-friendly, he said. We have many hard of hearing customers in Bath and always want to make their experience as brilliant as possible, and we hope Signsbury’s will help better their time in store even more.  The in-store drive to make the hearing-impaired feel more included is just one example of many initiatives being rolled out as part of the  Days of Community scheme. All , Sainsburyaposs colleagues are being given the chance to volunteer for a cause they feel passionately about in their local community. From community fundraising to hosting events and launching their own local campaigns, they are supporting causes ranging from community gardens to sports teams and elderly care homes. When in conversation with anyone deaf or hard of hearing, there are some very simple things you can do to make things a little easier…Relax Don’t panic!

It exceeds the previous record of .Cset in Faversham, Kent, in August . The figure was first announced as a provisional temperature on Friday and has now been validated by the Met Office observations team. It means the UK joins Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands in breaking national records as exceptionally high temperatures gripped large parts of central and western Europe last week.    The new official record was taken at the Botanic Garden, which houses a Met Office climate observation site that reports every  hours, prompting the release of the provisional figure. It has been subject to quality control and analysis over the past few days and has now been confirmed as a new official record for the hottest temperature seen in the UK. The Met Office said some observation sites report monthly, so there is still a chance even higher temperatures have been recorded from the heatwave, which saw much of the country sweltering in unusually hot conditions and causing disruption to transport.    Experts warn that global warming, caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels that are increasing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is making heatwaves more likely and more intense. A study from the Met Office previously showed last yearaposs summer heatwave was made around  times more likely than it would be under natural conditions as a result of human activity driving global warming. Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: Historically UK summer heatwaves would typically tend to peak in the low s Celsius, with extreme events reaching the mid-s.    The UK climate has been warming since the mid-th century, and this has been accompanied by similar increase in the hottest day of the year, which for the most recent decade has been .C higher when compared with the period -. Climate change has increased the likelihood and severity of heatwave episodes across Europe, which will have also increased the risks of a C temperature event in the UK. Professor Peter Stott, from the Met Office, said that while average global temperatures have risen by around C since the Industrial Revolution, some areas have warmed more quickly, with North Africa seeing rises of C.

Two hours after witnessing the assassination of her husband President Jack F Kennedy, America’s First Lady Jackie Kennedy watches his successor’s inauguration while still wearing the pink suit stained with his blood. Her fixed stare shows she is in a daze. But Jackie, who was born  years ago this week, had clarity of thought to know she was making a statement to the world. Before joining the  other people crammed in to Air Force One to witness Lyndon B Johnson’s inauguration, she refused to leave her husbandaposs coffin and help to change out of her blood-splattered clothes.  “I want them to see what they have done to Jack,” was her steely reply. President Johnson’s we Lady Bird recalled there was far more blood on Jackie which the presidential photographer kept out of frame. She said: “Her hair was falling in her face but she was very composed. “Mrs Kennedy’s dress was stained with blood. One leg was almost entirely covered with it and her right glove was caked with blood – her husband’s blood.Somehow that was one of the most poignant sights – that immaculate woman, exquisitely dressed, and caked in blood.” Jackie had regretted not being seen with even more blood. She told of wiping her face before she boarded the plane and instantly wishing she hadn’t. Jackie said:  One second later, I thought, aposWhy did I wash the blood off apos I should have left it there let them see what theyaposve done.”    Appearing in the inauguration pictures bearing her husband’s blood meant Jackie - who had quickly grasped the power of imagery - reminded the world of the murdered President. Her refusal to change was not solely about sending a message. Jackie was in severe shock. At Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, while her husband’s autopsy was performed, she began to relive the trauma sheaposd experienced. She relived driving down Dealey Plaza in Dallas in the open top limousine on that sunny morning of  November , as she and her husband waved to crowds.    Jackie, who was  at the time, was still recovering from the August death of their prematurely born son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy when she agreed to join husband on the trip to Texas. That morning John had persuaded her to wear the pink suit, one of his favourites. She looked the picture of elegance and pose as she beamed and waved back at well wishers. But as shots rained down from Lee Harvey Oswald’s gun, the president suddenly fell forwards. Video footage shows Jackie jump up and reach to the back of the car, some felt to retrieve some of her husband’s skull. But Jackie had no recollection of that moment. She repeated what she could remember, over and over, to the people who had gathered to comfort her at the hospital and recalled laying her body over his protectively as she cradled him in her lap.    When priests declared her husband dead at pm, Jackie knelt on the bloodied floor to pray for him. She did not take off the blood stained boucle suit - widely thought to be Chanel, but actually a “line for line” authorised replica made in New York so the First Lady wouldnapost be criticised for shopping overseas - until the next morning. She did not clean the blood off and her maid tearfully folded it and stored it in a box. No one knows the whereabouts of her hat and gloves, which were misplaced in the trauma of the assassination and the the days following.  The box was later sent to Jackie’s mother who wrote a note simply saying “November nd ” and placed in her attic. It was eventually donated to the National Archives in Maryland, where is kept out of public view in an acid-free container in a windowless room. In  Steven Tilley, a senior archivist, told a newspaper: “It looks like itaposs brand new, except for the blood. Also held at the museum are Lee Harvey Oswaldaposs rle, bullets and bullet fragments from the shooting, the original windshield of the limousine, and more than five million pages of assassination-related records.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":null,"title":"as it happens dundee v inverness caley thistle","story":"Danny Johnson struck on his Dundee debut to send the Dark Blues into the Betfred Cup last  and dump Inverness out.The former Motherwell striker grabbed the only goal of the Group D decider at Dens Park on  minutes.After a cute reverse from Shaun Byrne, the -year-old fired a low shot underneath Caley keeper Mark Ridgers, who perhaps should have done better.Championship rivals ICT end the group in second spot but that was not enough for them to earn a place in the knockout stages, with East Fe grabbing the final best-placed runners-up spot.Dundee will face Aberdeen at Dens Park in the last  but now prepare for their league opener at Dunfermline on Friday night."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-elephants-visit-glasgow-39-s-george-square","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-nightlife-entertainment-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"times-past-look-back-big-nights-glasgow","story":"Images from the archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":null,"title":"city-s-first-female-lord-provost-tea-tycoon-greatest-glaswegians","story":"WHO do you think is the greatest Glaswegian of all time  This summer we are showcasing the top  men and woman who have put the city on the map.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Front line staff are working hard to provide care in very dficult circumstances, but care in the community can only workproperly resourced by senior management.It is hard to avoid the conclusion that many of the decisions to sht care away from centres such as hospitals are as much to do with saving money as the genuine best interest of patients.In times of recession it is, once again, the most vulnerable in society who bear the brunt.The rain is teeming down as this is being written, but last weekend saw sunshine and crowds in Tarbert.The atmosphere was fantastic for the seafood festival, and there is no doubt the weather helped in a big way.Congratulations to the small band of organisers for another great weekend."},{"url":null,"title":"kilmartin twinshocks race report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe Nowby Jim GrieveRace day on the iconic former Grand Prix track at Carnasserie Castle on June  started off on a sombre note, as riders all paid respects with a minute of silence for fallen riding legendary Ian ‘Lugs’ Robertson.Many riders sported Ian’s riding number  on their bikes.The racing started with group one and the flying EVO cc class with Peter O#Neil, and William Penrice showing the bigger bikes how it should be done. Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

The pontoons saw a steady stream of locals and visitors who took the opportunity to talk to owners and find out the history of their boats. And, for the daring, the festival offered some thrills and spills with the greasy pole competition, which calls for skill and balance to avoid a dunking in the harbour.The family entertainment continued into Saturday night with an evening barbeue and music, with Thunder Road entertaining the party goers.As with all Tarbert festivals, community plays a big part, with the Tarbert Hotel sponsoring both the Saturday night band as well as the Sunday morning’s big breakfast. This welcome Sunday morning get together is the traditional festival finale before the boats, accompanied by some of Tarbert’s fleet, sail off home.PIC: no_aTarbertTradcaption: Amber showed skill and determination to take on the greasy polePIC: no_aTarbertTradcaption: Halfway there # Amber heading for homePIC: no_aTarbertTradcaption: Amber tames the greasy pole # with festival organiser Phil Roberton and Davie WattPIC: no_aTarbertTradcaption: Strolling along the pontoons and meeting boat ownersPIC: no_aTarbertTradcaption: Berthholders Pamela Watt and Diane Kelly"},{"url":null,"title":"artmap returns to argyll for 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArtmap Argyll are showcasing their artists’ and makers’ work at the Steamer Terminal in Ardrishaig for most of August ahead of the annual Open Studios .The venue, at the entrance to the Crinan Canal, is a cafe locally known as the #IN and OUT#.

and raised high the Blue Banner over fellow townsfolk as the Standard Bearer for .His moment in the spotlight came after outgoing Standard Bearer Jamie Boyd, ed it unsullied and untarnished to Games

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this area."},{"url":null,"title":"clive-storey-s-masquerade-takes-supreme-st-boswells-show","story":"THE Newtown St Boswells and District Farmers Show took place at St Boswells Auction Mart on Saturday.The

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more.

aresult of human activity driving global warming.Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: ldquoHistorically UK summer heatwaves would typically tend to peak in

study.Toddlers aged  months expect leaders to step up when a member of their group breaks the rules, research suggests.Scientists say their findings indicate children in their second year of le have a well-developed understanding of social hierarchies and power dynamics.The research relied on a well-established method that gives insight into the reasoning of children too young to fully express themselves verbally.Infants typically stare longer at events that unfold in ways they donrsquot expect.In a series of experiments, researchers used bear puppets to entertain the children who sat comfortably on a parentrsquos lap.Some of the  toddlers watched skits involving a protagonist bear that two other bears treated as a leader.Some saw a protagonist bear that appeared to have no authority over the other two bears.In all of the scenes the protagonist presented the other bears with two toys for them to share, but one bear quickly grabbed both toys, leaving none for the other bear.The children were then shown the protagonist either rectying this transgression by redistributing one of the toys from the wrongdoer bear to the victim bear.Or they watched the protagonist ignore the misbehaviour by approaching each bear and not redistributing a toy.University of Illinois psychology professor Renee Baillargeon, who led the research, said: ldquoInfants stared longer when the leader ignored the wrongdoing than when she rectied it.ldquoThis suggests that infants expected the leader to intervene and right the wrong in her group, and were surprised when she took no such action.When the leader ignored the transgression, the wrongdoer bear was also stared at for longer than the victim bear, as something about the wrongdoer would explain the leaderrsquos reluctance to correct her, researchers say.The toddlers seemed unsurprised when a protagonist who was not a leader failed to redress the same wrongdoing.The study was conducted in Baillargeonrsquos Infant Cognition Lab by graduate student Maayan Stavans, who then proceeded to postdoctoral studies on a Fulbright Fellowship at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel.She said: ldquoIn two experiments, infants consistently stared longer when leaders failed to act against wrongdoers.ldquoBut they held no particular expectation for intervention from non-leaders.In a third experiment, one of the bears announced it did not want a toy and the other bear took both toys.The children in this experiment stared longer when the leader intervened to make sure that each bear had one toy.ldquoIt was asthe infants understood that in this case there was no transgression, so they viewed it as overbearing for the leader to redistribute one of the toys to a bear who had made it clear she didnrsquot want one, Ms Stavans added.Researchers say the findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide new evidence that infants can reason about leaders.Professor Baillargeon said: ldquoWe knew from previous work that children this age have specic ideas about how followers will behave toward their leaders.ldquoNow we see that they also have complementary expectations about

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

She was regarded as an lsquoincomerrsquo, however, as she was born at Bolton, a couple of miles away, where she likely spent much of her childhood. When and how she came to Haddington I cannot say, or what her childhood was like, but it seems clear she was poor and for her, le was a struggle.She seems to have found companionship with Elizabeth Golight, who was Haddington born and bred. Perhaps they were neighbours in Haddington. Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

The second floor would feature six bedrooms, with four bath or shower rooms, and the top floor acting as a managerrsquos flat.The developer has highlighted the poor state of the building and said that the first and second floors were ldquoseriously affected by dry rot and are unsafe.A ldquopriority of repairing the building and eradicating the advancing dry rot has been identied, with the developer keen to bring the building back into use ldquobefore itrsquos too late.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, told the Courier she had previously seen inside the building and it was ldquoin a terrible state of repair.She said: ldquoAnybody that wants to come in and invest high-quality renovation in Dunbar is to be welcomed.ldquoIt is wonderful that the building, which is so prominent, is in line for a facelt.ldquoMy understanding is that the client group is going to be aimed at walkers and surfers and, again, that would be warmly welcomed.Attempts had previously been made to see the building re-open as a hotel.

The authors, Dr Kath Murray and Lucy Hunter Blackburn argue that in both cases, policy-makers, overly influenced by advocates for the rights of trans people, failed to consider how allowing people to self-declare their gender might affect other groups. ldquoThe analysis hows how decision making has been directed towards the interests of one specic interest group, to the detriment of another, women and girls, they state.Catriona Stewart:Trans rights questions in Yaniv male genitals waxing case must be answered in ScotlandA small number of influential actors appear to have secured a monopoly on how sex and gender identity are understood within Scottish policy-making.The report is not critical of the actions of LGBT groups in lobbying government. \"Lobbying in good faith on behalf of a particular interest group is a legitimate activity in a democracy,\" the authors state.But they claim government should weigh and balance the needs of all interest groups and this has not been done. An example, they say, is the failure to consider whether gender self-ID policies might be \"open to abuse by iniduals with malign intent, irrespective of gender identity\". The authors say \"there is evidence to suggest that failing to anticipate such abuse is naiive\".The article concludes that the Scottish Government should review the adequacy of its institutional safeguards against well-organised lobbying.A spokesman for the Government said the Scottish Government was developing guidance to help realise the rights of both women and trans people and Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville had reopened a consultation on its proposed reforms to gender recognition laws.\"The Cabinet Secretary said the Scottish Government would consult later this year on a draft Gender Recognition Bill, and this would include a full Equality Impact Assessment,\" the spokesman added.Read more:Gender self-ID law could run out of timeBut the gender reform debate has been a contentious topic even within the SNP government. This continued last week, when the SNPs National Womenrsquos and Equalities Convener Fiona Robertson faced signicant criticism online, including from SNP supporters, after she described a controversial Canadian trans activist as a ldquofemale predator and said Jessica Yaniv should not be misgendered.Yaniv is a transwoman who has been pursuing a number of businesses offering waxing services to women, after they would not offer the same service to her, because she is male bodied. Feminist campaigners say women should not be legally required to provide intimate services to a male-bodied person who declares they are a woman.Catriona Stewart:Trans rights questions in Yaniv male genitals waxing case must be answered in Scotlandn a debate on Twitter, Ms Robertson insisted Yaniv was a ldquofemale predator and that such people often ldquoused their womanhood as a way to access victims. But critics have accused her of being an apologist for male violence.When the Herald approached Joan McAlpine MSP, she said she had been lsquoinundatedrsquo with messages from female party members who disagreed with the women and equalities convenerrsquos comments. ldquoWhile there are female predators, they are exceptional,\" she said.Ms McAlpine said Ms Robertsons offence was then compounded by saying female predators use their femininity to harm other people. \"That sounds like the assertion a menrsquos rights activist would make, to try and deny male violence by blaming women. No one with any understanding of violence against women and girls would say such a thing and it certainly isnt a feminist argument.\"She added: \"Of course most men donrsquot commit violence against women and girls, but that doesnrsquot take away from the fact that around  per cent of sexual assaults are committed by men as are most violent crimes.

First, her customers get to go somewhere that is not too warm. Second, they get to enjoy slow travel, to really get to know the people and place they are visiting.Ms Hay said: ldquoOur groups are small, generally  people, and they get to work with local people and they go hiking, exploring the outdoors as well.ldquoAs well as Shetland Lace and Fair Isle knitting are learning about the sheep in their natural environment, the tour is designed to immerse themselves in the culture of the place.ldquoThe priority for me is that when they come here is it not just a whistle-stop tour but they are meeting locals and doinglocal things.Shetland, after all, has been suffering bouts of extreme over-tourism, usually when a big boat full of tourists anchors at Lerwick, the islandsrsquo capital.Scottish tourism numbers rose from . million bed nights in  to .m last year, with the Highlands and Islands seeing particularly fast growth.Attractions in the north and north-east recorded record numbers in .

My mum couldnt understand why I wanted to study English or drama.\":Why we love Glasgows street artHer mother would regularly walk past the University of Glasgow, gaze longingly at its towering spire and tell her daughters that they would one day study there. \"It was almost like she manested it,\" says Dr Krishan, a smile in her voice.\"It was one of her unfinished dreams. My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating. I was always testing the boundaries. I got into trouble at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions.\"When I failed all my exams in third year ndash I got straight sevens in my Standard Grades ndash my mum said she was going to send me to India to finish my studies. She had lost hope. I was given one last chance to turn it around. That was a wake-up call.\"Dr Krishan, who attended Notre Dame High School, knuckled down and achieved the grades to study medicine. \"It was after I became a doctor that I started to feel liberated,\" she attests. \"Then I really felt my wings unclipped after I became a mum.\"The birth of her son Aarish, now six, provided another watershed moment. \"I ended up on a ventilator in intensive care,\" she says. \"My family were told that I didnt have long to live. What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems. It has become my passion to focus more on the lestyle habits that people form, rather than just the -minute appointment model which is: How can I get you in and out  Can I give you a drug \"She takes her patients on \"Lidl walks\" to share tips on what foods to avoid and how to make healthier choices. Last year, Dr Krishan and a colleague set up Glasgow Wellbeings, a public group where they share their \"health hacks\", which has grown to more than  members.Dr Krishan is married to a fellow GP. \"He started off as an orthopaedic surgeon, but you cant live with me and not become a GP,\" she jokes. Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings. I have also lived as a troubled teenager trying to find my identity.\"With this man who was dying of cancer, I was helpless. There was nothing I could do. He knew that and I could see the fear in his eyes. It just felt so intuitive [to hug him] becausethat was my father or grandfather, I would have wanted somebody to reach out and say: Its OK, Im here for you.\"Follow Dr Punam Krishan on Twitter and Instagram at @DrPunamKrishan"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-wrong-write-off-north-sea-oil-assets","story":"In his dismissal of future oil revenues as any panacea for Scotland, Mr Hoskins will be aware of the suppression by successive Westminster governments of the  McCrone Report on North Sea oil, which said among many other things ldquoScotlandrsquos currency would become the hardest in Europe ndash Scots could possibly become richer than their southern neighbours ndash Scotlandrsquos budget surpluses would be so large as to be embarrassing. Of particular interest in the report was the identication of the West of Scotland as an area of special needs given its deprivation problems and how these might be improved with the revenue from oil. Westminster could very easily have created a special fund for Scotland at the time but no, the greed was too great and even the Britoil HQ based in Glasgow was closed and moved to London.Given the continuing problems of deprivation today and the recently reported huge number of drug deaths, it is quite simply unbelievable anyone living in Scotland would wish to continue under a Westminster regime that has consistently lied to Scotland and concealed the benefits of North Sea oil and it continues, as evidenced by Mr Hoskinsrsquo letter. That the price of oil has fallen and partially recovered is well known, but is it a resource of no real further benefit to Scotland  Consider the report in November  by Andy Critchlow, head of energy news for EMEA who, writing in The Dailysaid, without a single reference to Scotland, ldquothink what the UK would be like without the vast wealth generated by the equivalent of bn barrels of oil pumped from British territory over the past  years ndash there are up to bn barrels of oil still out there ndash North Sea oil should still give Britain the cash-generating power to defend its economy and the leverage to build new trading relationships overseas.Westminster wants us to believe oil is a millstone round our neck and there is a Scottish phrase for that: aye, right. It is unthinkable Westminster would set up a Scottish Oil Fund from oil and the vast gas revenues coming on-stream, especially as our new PM has the view that pound spent in Croydon is better than pound spent in Scotland. It is time to do it ourselves, they have had their chance and failed.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.THE letter by Robert Hoskins on the financial consequences of an independent Scotlandmakes some valid points, but not regarding the state pension being paid in a new Scottish currency.Current pensioners will continue to be paid in sterling .In fact, anyone still in employment with  years of qualying years will be treated similarly.Those with less than  years would receive a mixture of UK and Scottish Government pension.It would take at least a generation before a full Scottish Government pension, in whatever currency applies is paid.Jim McSheffrey, Gfnock.IN the House of Commons Boris Johnson askedScotland really wanted to join the euro, a currency which the Leave Campaign consistently dismissed as a joke during the referendum. TodayI bought euro for pound. Effectively the two currencies are at parity, whereas one could almost get euro for pound when the euro launched.I canrsquot help feeling that the euro joke is on me and I just donrsquot see what is funny. Perhaps Scotland should join asap. Maybe the poor English should do likewise. Things can only get worse.Ronald Cameron, Fort William.SINCE he took over leading the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford has used every exchange he has had with Government leaders to attempt to demean, insult, or be downright nasty to whomever he faces in the House.Never once has he attempted humour or wit to make a point. It has been the same mind-numbing and palpably phoney grievance-peddling, delivered in dead pan style, and antagonism, clearly meant to placate the zealots in his own party. He seems to relish in particular attacking the weak and wounded.Perhaps with a rumbustious new PM in office, ho will take no prisoners and gives as much he takes, Mr Blackford could try grown-up politics.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.BOTH Private Eye, as reported by Alistair Grant Brexit chaos in Commons\", The Herald, July  and Mr Grant are far too kind to Theresa May. Private Eyes blank page suggests she did not achieve anything she actually achieved much, but none of it worthy of praise.The ldquohostile environment for immigrants and the infamous vans with ldquoGo home emblazoned on them being driven through areas with ethnic minority populations hardly count as achievements of which any civilised human being would be proud. For a daughter of the church, they dont speak well of her Christianity.Mr Grant seems to accept that Mrs May kept her promise to end austerity. This would be laughable were it not so tragic for the victims. Figures published this week in Aberdeen show the continued rise in the need for food banks and the human stories of suicides resulting from the transfer to Universal Credit tell a very dferent story.I suppose Mrs Mays best hope, though not one to be welcomed by the rest of us, is that her successor so destroys livelihoods and social cohesion through his mad determination to tear the UK out of the EU, that herfailures fade into insignicance.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.WITH the usual sanctimony that we expect of the SNP, we hear time and time again that the party is against the privatisation of health care.

But the recently published findings of a study carried out at Washington State University show clear evidence of the mental health benefit to humans of pets.The randomised trial gauged  undergraduate students as they were split into four categories: petting cats and dogs looking at a slideshow of images of cats and dogs watching other people pet animals or being sat in a waiting room without animals where they were banned from using phones, reading or talking to one another - but on the upside, they were given pizza vouchers.The study, published in the American Educational Research Association, was set up to respond to evidence that levels of stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts have increased among young people at university, and that these iniduals are more likely to get poorer grades or drop out.The researchers measured the participants cortisol - the stress hormone. Saliva samples were collected each morning after the students woke up and again to reflect pre- and post-test cortisol in the dferent categories.The scientists controlled for factors which might influence cortisol such as sleeping patterns, exercise, caffeine and alcohol intake. They also graded each student on their existing levels of stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms.The results showed that those who had hands-on interactions with cats or dogs experienced by far the steepest and longest sustained drop in their cortisol, indicating \"momentary stress relief\" had indeed occurred.Unfortunately, for those seeking a scientic answer to the thorny question, which is better, cats or dogs , the study draws a blank. Interactions with dogs and cats were counted as one category, although participants were actually allocated one or the other.The second-best results were achieved in the waiting room group - surely proof of the benefits of free pizza.So with turbulent times ahead, perhaps the Government should provide all citizens with a cat, a dog ndash or pizza "},{"url":null,"title":"prince-charles-opens-scotland-s-biggest-ever-offshore-wind-farm","story":"The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm, located km off the coast of Caithness, will save around eight million tonnes of carbon emissions over  years.The North Sea wind farm, which has been welcomed by environmental groups, was opened by the Duke of Rothesay on Monday.Beatricersquos  turbines will generate MW of energy - enough to power , homes every year, and will play a crucial role in the UKrsquos efforts to combat climate change over the next  years.The pound.bn project is the largest ever single private investment in Scotland and was developed by Scottish-headquartered energy firm, SSE Renewables, along with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power Limited.Construction of the wind farm, Scotlandrsquos single largest source of renewable energy, has provided a pound.bn economic boost to the UK, of which poundbn went directly to Scotland.Jim Smith, managing director of SSE Renewables, said the firm was ldquoincredibly proud of the new development.ldquoWersquore incredibly privileged and honoured to welcome His Royal Highness to Wick today to perform the official opening of Scotlandrsquos largest wind farm, Beatrice, he said.ldquoToday is about celebrating the hard work, innovation, drive and collaboration of thousands of people from across Scotland, the UK and further afield who all played their part in building Beatrice, which is now Scotlandrsquos largest offshore wind farm and the fourth largest in the world.ldquoWersquore incredibly proud itrsquos been delivered on time and under budget, even when dealing with the challenges the North Sea and deep waters bring.ldquoWersquore especially proud of the signicant positive impact Beatrice has already made to the communities of Wick and Caithness, and which will last for decades to come.ldquoThe UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world and this world-class offshore project paves the way for future development in Scotland and the UK to help decarbonise our economy while boosting jobs and growth.ldquoMost importantly, Beatrice will save around m tonnes of harmful carbon emissions over its -year letime operation, making one of the most signicant contributions across the UK in combating climate change and meeting our net zero ambitions.The opening of the wind farm was welcomed by WWF Scotland, who claimed the renewables sector is helping to tackle the worldwide climate emergency.Charity director Lang Banks said: ldquoScotland is already generating record amounts of power from renewable sources helping us to avoid millions of tonnes of climate-wrecking carbon emissions every year.ldquoThe addition of power from huge offshore wind farms such Beatrice will help us to decarbonise even more of our economy, including our heating and transport sectors.ldquoWersquore in the middle of a climate emergency and renewables will continue to play a critical role in powering the country, creating jobs, and reducing carbon emissions.

The name derives from Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the Moon, and the Gaelic word for cow, Bò.Alex Keen, launch specialist from Sent into Space, said: “Launching at Gilnockie Tower was a real treat. Not only were the team from VisitScotland a great bunch to work with but the countryside we crossed in pursuit of our payload is one of the most beautul and dramatic landscapes we’ve visited. “Once the Coosmonaut was back in our hands, we were genuinely sad to leave and head back to England.”A new tourism map highlighting Scotland’s links to space exploration and the first moonwalk has also been released.On the new trail...among the Scottish landmarks on the new VisitScotland map is the dark sky observatory in Dalmellington, Ayrshire.The Scotland is Out of this World trail is part of the new VisitScotland campaign of the same name.The trail features Scottish connections to each planet in the solar system, as well as fun facts and details of science centres and the best places to stargaze.Highlights incude:data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.gallowaygazette webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"This is what , can fetch you across the UK\"  This is what you can rent for £, per month across the UK viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GALL | Article Teaser\"Mars – Glenelg, Highlands: In  the village twinnedwith a geological feature on Mars, called Glenelg.Jupiter – Loch Airigh, Isle of Harris: The loch in the Outer Hebrides portrays the planet Jupiter in the  Stanley Kubrick directed film, : A Space Odyssey.Uranus – Braemar: The birthplace of Johann von Lamont, an astronomer who calculated the mass of Uranus.Neptune – Jedburgh, Scottish Borders: The birthplace of th century science writer Mary Somerville who theorised that dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus may point to an undiscovered planet, which inspired the discovery of Neptune.Venus – Parton, Dumfries and Galloway: The resting place of th century physicist James Clerk Maxwell, whose name was given to Maxwell Montes, the planet’s only feature named after a man.The Scotland is Out of this World campaign marks the th anniversary of the Apollo  mission and US astronaut Neil Armstrong’s historic walk on the lunar surface.But it also celebrates the th anniversary of VisitScotland.Malcolm Roughead, chief executive, said: “For  years VisitScotland has helped position Scotland as a must-visit destination to audiences across the world.“It is therefore fitting that in our anniversary year we set our sights even further and travelled into space in what can only be described as a truly out of this world campaign.“Scotland is Out of this World offered the opportunity to delve into the past and celebrate the country’s contribution to space exploration and its ancestral links to one of the greatest moments in history.“The new trail reveals some of the country’s stellar attractions and locations to visit to firmly cement Scotland’s place in astro-tourism. “After all, our best views aren’t confined to our awe-inspiring landscapes but reach up high into the night sky above as well.”Ohio-born Neil Armstrong was proud of his Scottish heritage.

On the evening of July , Armstrong and Aldrin touched down on the lunar surface. Armstrong took “one giant leap for mankind” when he became the first person to walk on the moon.Three years after that historic moment, the Ohio-born NASA astronaut who commanded Apollo  took another “small step” into the history books in Langholm, the ancestral home of Clan Armstrong.There, in the “Muckle Toon”, he became the first and only person to be awarded the freedom of the burgh.Accepting the honour, he told the audience: “It’s said that the most dficult place to be recognised is in one’s own home town.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football. And make up your own mind about the glorious bits!Jockie WoodNo customer reviews for the moment.* Required fields"},{"url":null,"title":"stromness shopping week in full swing  \n","story":"newsStromness Shopping Week in full swingJuly ,  at : pm##A sandcastle competition entertained young children.This castle paid tribute to Shopping Week with its bunting.Alannah Moar enchanted the crowd when she performed at the Town House Garden.A pavement artist competition at the Pier Arts Centre attracted budding young artists.Despite a damp start to Stromness Shopping Week on Monday, during its official opening ceremony, crowds have been turning out to enjoy all that the annual week of events has to offer.The town enjoyed a scorcher of a day yesterday, with a selection of events including pavement art and sandcastle building.

In all of the scenes the protagonist presented the other bears with two toys for them to share, but one bear quickly grabbed both toys, leaving none for the other bear.The children were then shown the protagonist either rectying this transgression by redistributing one of the toys from the wrongdoer bear to the victim bear.Or they watched the protagonist ignore the misbehaviour by approaching each bear and not redistributing a toy.University of Illinois psychology professor Renee Baillargeon, who led the research, said: ldquoInfants stared longer when the leader ignored the wrongdoing than when she rectied it.ldquoThis suggests that infants expected the leader to intervene and right the wrong in her group, and were surprised when she took no such action.When the leader ignored the transgression, the wrongdoer bear was also stared at for longer than the victim bear, as something about the wrongdoer would explain the leaderrsquos reluctance to correct her, researchers say.The toddlers seemed unsurprised when a protagonist who was not a leader failed to redress the same wrongdoing.The study was conducted in Baillargeonrsquos Infant Cognition Lab by graduate student Maayan Stavans, who then proceeded to postdoctoral studies on a Fulbright Fellowship at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel.She said: ldquoIn two experiments, infants consistently stared longer when leaders failed to act against wrongdoers.ldquoBut they held no particular expectation for intervention from non-leaders.In a third experiment, one of the bears announced it did not want a toy and the other bear took both toys.The children in this experiment stared longer when the leader intervened to make sure that each bear had one toy.ldquoIt was asthe infants understood that in this case there was no transgression, so they viewed it as overbearing for the leader to redistribute one of the toys to a bear who had made it clear she didnrsquot want one, Ms Stavans added.Researchers say the findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide new evidence that infants can reason about leaders.Professor Baillargeon said: ldquoWe knew from previous work that children this age have specic ideas about how followers will behave toward their leaders.ldquoNow we see that they also have complementary expectations about how leaders will behave toward their followers.copy -.

It has been in planning for a decade.The farm was developed by Scottish-headquartered energy firm, SSE Renewables, in partnership with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Red Rock Power.WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ldquoScotland is already generating record amounts of power from renewable sources helping us to avoid millions of tonnes of climate-wrecking carbon emissions every year. The addition of power from huge offshore wind farms such Beatrice will help us to decarbonise even more of our economy, including our heating and transport sectors.ldquoWersquore in the middle of a climate emergency and renewables will continue to play a critical role in powering the country, creating jobs, and reducing carbon emissions.For Scotland to unlock its full potential to provide the whole of the UK with plentul and cost effective renewable electricity, the UK Government needs to get fully behind wind power, both on and offshore.Construction of the wind farm, Scotlandrsquos single largest source of renewable energy, has provided a £.bn economic boost to the UK, of which £bn went directly to Scotland.Jim Smith, Managing Director of SSE Renewables said: ldquoToday is about celebrating the hard work, innovation, drive and collaboration of thousands of people from across Scotland, the UK and further afield who all played their part in building Beatrice, which is now Scotlandrsquos largest offshore wind farm and the fourth largest in the world.ldquoWersquore incredibly proud itrsquos been delivered on time and under budget, even when dealing with the challenges the North Sea and deep waters bring. Wersquore especially proud of the signicant positive impact Beatrice has already made to the communities of Wick and Caithness, and which will last for decades to come.\"He added: ldquoThe UK has the biggest offshore wind industry in the world and this world-class offshore project paves the way for future development in Scotland and the UK to help decarbonise our economy while boosting jobs and growth.ldquoMost importantly, Beatrice will save around eight million tonnes of harmful carbon emissions over its -year letime operation, making one of the most signicant contributions across the UK in combating climate change and meeting our net zero ambitions.SSE Renewables will operate the project, which will support up to  long-term jobs ndash from offshore technicians to office administrators ndash with the majority based in the rural community of Wick.Claire Mack, chief executive of Scottish Renewables, said: \"The scale of the Beatrice project is truly staggering: almost twice the investment of the Queensferry Crossing the fourth largest offshore wind farm in the world, and all happening in the North East of Scotland. This is quite simply the most exciting renewable energy development in the UK right now.\"Scotland has a quarter of Europes offshore wind resource and Beatrice represents one of the first steps in tapping it. As our offshore wind projects continue to build out well see the environmental and economic benefits of offshore wind grow across Scotland, with jobs and investment transforming communities, as they already are in Wick.\"Beatrice will also benefit the local community to the tune of £m over the letime of the wind farm. Two Beatrice Community Benefit funds, totalling £m, have been established to deliver sustainable investment in the local community including coastal towns and villages as well as the wider Highland and Moray areas. Beatrice has paid a further £m into a Coastal Community Fund, which will be delivered by the Scottish Government.Paul Wheelhouse, Scottish Government Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, said: ldquoAt MW it is the largest offshore wind development in Scotland to date and can provide electricity for a huge number of homes and businesses.I am also very encouraged by the positive impacts the project has had, such as the regeneration of Wick harbour and the role Scottish fabricators and suppliers have played in its construction.ldquoIn order to maximise economic opportunities a collaborative effort is required between Governments and industry to ensure that our vision for a vibrant offshore wind sector in Scotland is achieved.\"He added: ldquoThere is a signicant pipeline of consented projects, including two further consented sites locally, and, as we look to future licensing rounds, we will seek to fully exploit the wider offshore wind sector opportunities for the Scottish economy while showing due regard for our incredible marine environment.

The Tories’ blonde bombshell, now more lithe with a spring in his step, more effervescent with the pop and fizz of a victor’s champagne, has brought his boundless positivity to the British premiership. The new PM has taken the field with a leap that even Bob Beamon would envy. In Manchester he announced how hundreds of billions of borrowed money would be thrown at Northern cities like the tickertape confetti that greeted theof Apollo  astronauts to New York. He did not cancel HS but instead pumped up the volume by promising it would definitely go on to Leeds and probably beyond. Likewise we can expect more largesse when he visits Glasgow, asit’s a lack of government funding that holds Scotland’s economy back rather than the SNP’s perverse policy priorities and an addiction to higher taxes.The result is there for all to see – an almighty bounce across a range of polls that gives great heart to Conservative supporters, be they Leavers or Remainers, and provides hope to a wilting public that the saga of Brexit may at last be settled. And yet some words of caution are required. The Prime Minister’s joyous enthusiasm has made the cup runneth over for far too many commentators who have imbibed his chin-up, can-do, best of British mentality. Some Andrews Liver Salts are needed, and when not available a cold bath is in order. The last time I looked the UK was still inside the European Union and its leaders are not yet talking. Despite all the shrill outrage at a far right take-over of government from easily offended opponents the Conservative Cabinet continues to have a signicant remainer majority of - per cent. Only two of its members, Priti Patel and Theresa Villiers voted consistently against May’s attempts at surrender. Thus a classic British fudge remains more likely than trading on WTO terms.After the litany of broken promises and open acceptance of scaremongering it is no surprise that even Labour voters can be heard to say the Johnson is a breath of fresh air compared to May’s halitosis-like pessimism. Just as many said May should be given a chance, so too all but the most bitter ideologues are hoping Johnson might just surprise even himself and escape from the EU straitjacket, undo the chains and swim to the surface of the River Thames he chose to jump in. Thus we have four weekend polls that all give the Conservatives a bounce of anything between  to  per cent, mainly at the expense of the Brexit Party. This was to be expected and exactly mirrors what happened when Theresa May gained ten points on becoming Prime Minister. But is that it  Will there be more gains for Johnson  He certainly needs them, for languishing at  per cent after a bounce is not enough for the Conservatives to win a general election. Johnson has to go further, he must be touching  per cent to be assured of victory and to do that he needs to deliver on his promise and take the country out of the European Union and on time. That means living beyond the jurisdiction of the European Courts of Justice deciding for ourselves where our troops are deployed in foreign adventures choosing who might reap the harvest from fishing in our waters deciding who can enter our country, what taxes and at what rates of tax we might levy what regulations even our domestic commerce must submit to and what barriers we must unjustly erect to keep poorer countries poor.Johnson needs more bounce – but what bounces up must come down. If he does not provide some semblance of achieving a real and clean Brexit on the due date then his bounce must reach its apogee and then fall, ing eventually to the same point from where it came. Those of my generation will remember those super-bouncy balls that when thrown down on the playground would rise like a rocket, seemingly into orbit beyond the roofline, only to falter and thento terra firma. Only by catching a bouncing ball at a point higher than from which it was dropped can the energy unleashed have been said to be beneficial. When to catch that bounce is the judgment of when to call an election and that requires a fine touch, not least because calling an election is no longer the sole prerogative of the Prime Minister.To strengthen his hand Johnson needed to assert himself over his immediate opponents and last week showed he relishes the fight. The Labour Party must be fretting from the mother of all drubbings Johnson unleashed on Corbyn and McDonnell during his statement to the House. Those glum faces behind Labour’s demi-Marxist leaders were undoubtedly thinking ‘we had better get ourselves someone new, someone optimistic and upbeat, someone positive and full of love and joy, but who and how ’ So long as the unions choose who reigns in the Court of the Crimson King then Corbyn remains our st century Schizoid Man, with his two political personas of socialist militancy or moderate avuncular grandad that are irreconcilable.Similarly a bruised Ian Blackford was given notice the SNP parliamentary leader needs to get fighting fit when he enters the ring with the big boys. If he still enjoys his Porsche I last saw him in maybe he should swap it for a Boris Bike  Theresa May tended to parry Blackford, but Johnson has no qualms of pummelling him into a pulp and enjoying it too. Only Nigel Farage will present an altogether tougher challenge, having already seen off the last two premiers with his cutting jabs, but that title fight is not anticipated until after Hallowe’en.With Westminster now on holiday until September, and then almost immediately breaking again for party conferences, last week’s theatre will work for Johnson in the short term but eventually he must face the demons namely his promise to leave the EU at the end of October – and without a dealthat’s what it takes.Failure to do so, or offering a leless zombie version of May’s Withdrawal Agreement and its equally abhorrent Political Declaration, must see his bounce dissipate to the point of being an aberration. At that point a general election may well be inescapable and the advantage will be with the Brexit Party.• Brian Monteith MEP is chief whip of the Brexit Party©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dani garavelli worst moment for the scottish independence stars to align","story":"At a crossroads for Scottish nationalism Boris Johnson#s bombastic Tories aren#t the only ones making a spectacle of themselves, writes Dani GaravelliIf there was one bit of solace to be taken from last week’s ideological coup it was its potential to boost the campaign for Scottish independence. How could anyone watch Boris Johnson – a liar and a cad, with all the poise of a rutting walrus – talk up a No Deal and pledge to bring in an Australian-style immigration system without concluding: “Enough is enough” Each fresh cabinet appointment was a bell chiming the need for urgent action: Priti Patel, advocate of capital punishment, as Home Secretary Dominic Raab, supporter of proroguing parliament, as Foreign Secretary Michael Gove, butcher of the English education system, as head of the Cabinet Office. If those names weren’t enough to convince you to put your X beside the Yes box on a putative independence ballot paper, then what would it take  Katie Hopkins as Propaganda Secretary  The Big Bad Wolf as Minister for Housing In the three years since Leave’s victory, the two countries have drted further and further apart. And Johnson is the best recruiting sergeant the SNP could have asked for, which is why Nicola Sturgeon was quick to say she would consider accelerating plans for the second independence referendum she has already pledged to hold before .There are huge logistical obstacles to overcome we know the new Prime Minister is even less likely than Theresa May to grant a Section  order for a legally binding plebiscite. But with a UK government now aping Trumpian politics and refusing even to feign interest in its northern neighbour, there could be no better opportunity to win over No voters.Unfortunately, this opportunity has presented itself at the worst possible time for both the SNP and the wider Yes movement, which are in the process of tearing themselves asunder. Divisions between the left and right wings, the gradualists and the revolutionaries, the newbies and the old-timers, which were kept in check by the party machine and the need to unite behind their common cause in , have exploded into the open. The internal feuding is now so visible, and the atmosphere so poisonous, the campaign is faltering, just as it ought be gaining momentum. One of the most volatilefaultlines has been the reform of the Gender Recognition Actwhich –passed – would allow trans people to self-identy and remove the requirement for medical evidence. Less than a year ago, this was regarded as an easy win – a human rights issue that would consolidate the party’s reputation as a progressive force. But this gambit backfired. Every day now, political Twitter resounds to the angry exchanges between party members who have positioned themselves on either side of this fractious debate. Disagreements over policy are not unusual what sets this apart is the rancour of the rhetoric, and the bad faith, with some members of both camps resorting to abuse and others regarding it as a make-or-break issue for their continued membership of the party. So problematic has it proved that the reforms have been put on hold. However, instead of providing a cooling-off period, the delay appears to have created space for acrimony to fester and grow.Further isions are being caused by a perceived inertia at the top of the party. Johnson’s election has increased the pressure for action. With no obvious mechanism to achieve a second referendum, some on the fringes are demanding a Unilateral Declaration of Independence .Given there is no evidence of a majority in favour of separation, this would be reckless in the extreme. It would leave us isolated and raise the spectre of civil disorder. And yet those who resist the idea – many of whom were campaigning for independence before their critics were born – are having their commitment questioned.Throw into this melee, the implosion of All Under One Banner– the flag-fixated organisation beloved of the Trumpian tendency, but scorned by much of the mainstream, and you have a highly combustible set of circumstances. That AOUB would self-destruct – the director of operations Manny Singh was sacked earlier this month after being reported to the procurator fiscal in connection with breaching the Civic GovernmentAct – was entirely predictable, but cries of “I told you so” are hardly likely to placate those who may now be deprived of an outlet for their frustrations.Some of the party’s current problems are of its own making. It failed to recognise that the reform of the GRA, which could be seen as pitting the rights of two oppressed groups against each other, would be trickier to steer through Holyrood than the Marriage and Civil Partnership Act. It also ignored warnings about the need for senior party figures to clamp down on the extremists who frequently threaten its credibility. It is too late now to tame those wilder elements who shout about UDI.Though, for some, the isions are the product of sincerely held beliefs, for others they are proxies for a power struggle between those who continue to support Sturgeon and those who support Alex Salmond. Ever since a series of sex allegations were made against the former First Minister, and particularly since he was charged, the party appears to have been in the grip of a major power struggle between the two camps.Whatever the outcome, and however unfair this seems, the court case has the potential to bring down the First Minister and it has been clear for some time that Joanna Cherry fancies herself as the successor.Meanwhile, the UK political chat is of a possible general election in the autumn. With no likelihood of Johnson experiencing a change of heart on Scotland’s right to self-determination, this could provide the best route to the SNP securing a Section  order. A large rise in support for the SNP would be interpreted as a mandate for a second referendum and might allow the party to hold a position of power in a Labour minority government just as the DUP has done in the minority Tory government since June .In order to capitalise on this opportunity, however, the SNP would have to mobilise speedily and effectively. It would need to remember that only by parking its dferences and uniting behind a common goal did the movement drive the Yes vote up from  to  per cent in the last campaign.This time round, the dferences are more entrenched. The efforts to undermine Sturgeon have been concerted. With the court case pending, there is little she can do but hold her nerve against the plotters and conspiracy theorists to refuse to pander to those who fail to understand that independence – to be legitimate – must be the settled will of the Scottish people.If the party cannot see past its internal struggles and marshal itself into some sort of fighting force, it will squander the chance to rescue Scotland from the grips of the Tory cabal and the potential catastrophe of a No Deal Brexit. That battle can only be won by convincing the majority of Scots that independence will produce a better, more consensual kind of politics not merely a tartan version of the back-stabbing, ego-driven lust for power which has inflicted so much damage on the UK over the last five years.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wanted nurse for remote scottish island with population of 170","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Isle of Raasay, which has a population of around  people, has not had resident medical cover for a decade, despite a long campaign by islanders to get a community nurse.The island, considered to be one of the most beautul parts of Scotland, is reliant on medics travelling from neighbouring Skye, with one GP surgery held once a week on a Wednesday, and three district nurses working on a rota Monday to Friday.: Historic Burns Monument reopens following major restoration work: Wanted: Teacher for remote Scottish islandFor the past four years, residents have been campaigning to get a nurse who lives on the island, as there is no out-of-hours medical provision.In December , NHS Highlands unsuccessfully tried to recruit a resident nurse.But hopes are high that a new recruitment drive could bring someone looking for a slower pace of le to the island, with a job ad closing next month.Anne Gillies, chair of Raasay Community Council, said: \"A resident nurse on Raasay will be a huge boost to the community.\"It will make an enormous dference, particularly to families with young children and our elderly population.\"Were all very happy at the prospect of having a nursing presence on the island again.\"Kate Earnshaw, district manager for NHS Skye, Lochalsh and Wester Ross, said: \"This is an exciting opportunity for a suitably qualied and experienced nurse to join the CommunityNursing Team and make a real dference to healthcare provision on Raasay.\"We hope this opening will appeal to candidates looking for a real sht in lestyle.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to live and work and we look forward to attracting lots of applications.\"The Band  post is permanent, can be full-time or part-time, and comes with a salary of £, to £,.He or she would be the first clinician on the scene in the event of an emergency on the island, would be required to provide on-call nursing cover, and would be the main point of contact on the island for the Skye-based GPs and rural medics at the MacKinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford, on Skye.The role promises \"considerable autonomy\" as Raasays nurse will be responsible for assessing, planning, implementing and reviewing the islands healthcare needs.NHS Highland said it is seeking \"qualied, confident, competent and experienced\" candidates who must be \"adaptable and resourceful, working without a hospital or GP at hand\".Up to date clinical knowledge and skills are required, as is a desire to work in a remote, rural setting.The health board hopes to be able to hire more than one nurse for the island.A spokesman said: \"The post holder would have a lot of iety in their job every day is likely to be dferent as they would be dealing with patients from young children to the elderly.\"In addition to the professional challenges of working predominantly on their own, the remote location could present some challenges to everyday le, such as transport.\"For the community, the presence of resident nurse cover is greatly anticipated and will bring reassurance.\"Raasay is a wonderful place to work and live and to bring up a family.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes. If you plant them they grow early in the season and that encourages the birds to come in.“I’m sure some volunteers will spend a day digging nettles on a wintry day and think ‘What’s this all about ’ But when you stand here now on a summer’s day and think there’s a bird that’s globally threatened and you have helped to save it by just going out and digging up some nettle rhizomes, well you know most of the people involved will be absolutely delighted at the results.”Farmer Richard Green is delighted to have been hearing the corncrake’s call - on the second corncrake site - over the last few years.He said: “For me, it started four years ago when we had a corncrake calling right through the summer.“To hear that this year there are two pairs, one of which is on our land, is great. It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

Speaking to the Andersonstown News, following meetings this week with the Department for Communitiesand Ulster GAA, West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said that as “far as I can ascertain, all the information required for this project is in”. He added: “I would be expecting a decision on planning before the end of .”The redevelopment of Casement Park has faced several setbacks since it was first announced in December .The then SDLP Environment Minister Mark H Durkan granted planning approval for the £ million ,-capacity stadium, however, a year later a High Court Judge quashed the planning approval following a successful residents’ legal challenge. The judge ruled that the impact of bigger crowds exiting the stadium had not been properly examined. As of February , Ulster GAA have submitted its revised Casement Park planning application with a reduced capacity of ,.Speaking after a round of top level meetings this week, Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News: “I met with the DfC on Monday and I’m in constant contact with the Department for Infrastructurewhose Permanent Secretary, in the absence of a department minister, will make the decision on planning for the project. “I met with the Ulster Council in Armagh on Tuesday, and have been meeting with all the stakeholders with regards to Casement Park for a long, long time.“There are around £ million of additional costs to the Casement Park project due to time delay and change of design. DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailin away on the crest of a wave","story":"TO understand today’s music scene in West Belfast you have to go way back to brass, reed and silver bands. There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"dup sinn fein must face up to reality for stormont return","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

were no plans for talks with Mr Johnson on Monday.A spokesman for the Taoiseach later said he hoped the men would speak in the “near future”.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr

the disastrous impact that Brexit will have for Ireland.We raised this issue with British SOS Julian Smith. pic yQCZjhNveH— Michelle O’NeillJuly , She raised the matter during a meeting with Northern Ireland’s new secretary of state Julian Smith at Stormont on Monday.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said.“That is highly offensive given the disastrous impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.”Mrs O’Neill said Mr Smith did not offer an explanation as to why there had been no contact between the prime ministers.She said it was not up to her who made the first move in initiating a conversation.“Whoever phones who first, the issue that needs to be discussed are the implications, the catastrophic implications for the island of Ireland so I think whenever the Taoiseach and Boris Johnson speak at some stage I think the message will be very, very clear from An Taoiseach – which will be around Brexit, the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, it will be around the fact the withdrawal agreement needs to be adhered to and agreed because this is what the British government negotiated themselves a short time ago,” she said.Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I dont know is the answerMichelle ONeill on Boris JohnsonMrs O’Neill added: “British-Irish relations are very important, that does strike right to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, but the jeopardy that the British government want to bring to our people on this island cannot be understated – it is huge, it’s going to impact for generations to come.”Mrs O’Neill said the rhetoric from Downing Street and the “right-wing cabinet” did not suggest there was going to be a Brexit deal achieved by the October deadline.She said she did not know Mr Johnson’s motivation in threatening to leave the EU without an agreement.“Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I don’t know is the answer,” she said.“What I am fixated on, what I am concerned about is what it means for the people here.”The Sinn Fein Assembly member added: “The language we have heard from Downing Street and the cabinet team over the course of the weekend has been very frightening for people on the ground.”Mrs O’Neill rejected the suggestion the Government might move to legislate to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland ahead of the October  Brexit deadline,devolution has not be restored by then.“Direct rule is not acceptable, we cannot go backwards, we can only go forwards,” she said.The republican leader said she told Mr Smith he could not be a “bystander” in negotiations to restore

The Irishman is Scorsese’s  million US dollar Netflix film about the reflections of a former Jimmy Hoffa associate and hit man.

How widely Netflix will release it remains to be seen major cinema chains have thus far refused to play films that do not adhere to a traditional exclusive theatrical release window of  days. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Robert de Niro is a cast member in The Irishman Netflix has said holding movies back from its streaming service does not serve its subscribers.In an interview in June, Scorsese said Netflix was the only one willing to bankroll the ambitious film, based on Charles Brandt’s I Heard You Paint Houses.“No one  did. No one  did,” said Scorsese, who also turned to Netflix for his Bob Dylan documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story By Martin Scorsese.“We decided to make it with the understanding that it’ll maybe never be shown in theatres. They said, ‘You would have a time in theatres’ — a few weeks or whatever. I said fine. The idea was to make the movie, you see.”\"It’s the work of masters, made with a command of the art of cinema that I’ve seen very rarely in my letime, and it plays out at a level of subtlety and human intimacy that truly stunned me.\" - Kent Jones on THE IRISHMANSee the full announcement: https:t.co stdedLtmnV #NYFF pic PqAeiKN— New York Film FestivalJuly , Scorsese has also lamented the major studios’ reliance on blockbusters. “I don’t do those,” said Scorsese. “There’s only so much time in your le. I need to make these movies. I just need to. So where do I go ”The filmmaker on Monday said he was grateful for the New York Film Festival selectionand praised the festival as “critical to bringing awareness to cinema from around the world”.The New York Film Festival runs from September  to October ."},{"url":null,"title":"civil servants derry pledge take strike action","story":"Civil service workers in Derry have pledged to take further industrial action after a strike was held on Friday.Following Friday’s pickets, Civil Service workers affiliated to public service Trade Union NIPSA were told that Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance, “doesn’t give a damn about you”.They were cautioned that one day of action would not be enough to bring about meaningful change, therefore, plans are in motion to take further strike action.Comments made by NIPSA’s Deputy General Secretary, Carmel Gates, were greeted by applause when she called for additional strike days from today onwards and action short of all-out strikes.Members of political parties were present to show their support, including representatives from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and People Before Profit.Workers in Derry and Belfast gathered for strike action over pay and conditions.NIPSA members in the NI Civil Service were on the picket lines at a number of buildings in Derry. Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors. PBP Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced his support for all “necessary action”.NIPSA representative Ruaidhri O’Sandair had one final message for the department of Finance, “Sue Gray, where’s our pay ”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"yfc duo honoured meet uk zulu royals","story":"Aberhafesp YFC dancers on the YFC Stage and Berriew YFCs Sian Emberton with Theltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt Duchess of Cornwallltspan classtruncate-full-screengt.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.”Jamie Dornan’s emotional pancreatic cancer plea sparked by loss of mumCraigavon bomb attack: Police hunting man who ran from improvised booby trap Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so. This is what we are used to unfortunately. It is very sad that I have to say that but it is what our policing environment looks like here in Northern Ireland.“I think, even in terms of our response on Saturday morning in the early hours, it shows how alive we are to the possibilities with such devices. While it saddens me, it doesn’t surprise me.”try catch  TrendingPSNI probe sudden death of teenagerlsquoBeautulrsquo Danika McGuigan passes away after lsquobraversquo cancer battleTeenager killed in head-on crashN.I. mankilled in serious road traffic collision killed in serious road traffic collision\"Police probe after little boy rushed to hospital*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

And Irsquove also been talking about sport ndash this time football and ensuring young people can get involved in teams, but also have opportunities to progress within their chosen sport as well.In Westminster Irsquove been talking about serious violence and ensuring we get police on our streets to deal with kne crime and other violence, which sadly wersquove seen on the rise in some parts of the UK.Irsquove also been talking about the steel industry. Steel is a crucial backbone here in Wales, but there is worrying news from some parts of the industry across the UK. Irsquom glad to say that we have a thriving steel plant here in the constituency, employing a lot of people who produce steel for our construction industry and many other infrastructure projects ndash but itrsquos crucial that those projects are open to Welsh steel, in order to drive jobs and business here in our local community.In the Commons I challenged the Conservative Welsh Secretary over what I believe is his failure to stand up for our steel industry.I asked him: ldquoSteel is of course the foundation of any successful industrial strategy.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs OrsquoNeill added: ldquoBritish-Irish relations are very important, that does strike right to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, but the jeopardy that the British government want to bring to our people on this island cannot be understated ndash it is huge, itrsquos going to impact for generations to come.Mrs OrsquoNeill said the rhetoric from Downing Street and the ldquoright-wing cabinet did not suggest there was going to be a Brexit deal achieved by the October deadline.She said she did not know Mr Johnsonrsquos motivation in threatening to leave the EU without an agreement.ldquoIs he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I donrsquot know is the answer, she said.ldquoWhat I am fixated on, what I am concerned about is what it means for the people here.The Sinn Fein Assembly member added: ldquoThe language we have heard from Downing Street and the cabinet team over the course of the weekend has been very frightening for people on the ground.Mrs OrsquoNeill rejected the suggestion the Government might move to legislate to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland ahead of the October  Brexit deadline,devolution has not be restored by then.ldquoDirect rule is not acceptable, we cannot go backwards, we can only go forwards, she said.The republican leader said she told Mr Smith he could not be a ldquobystander in negotiations to restore powersharing, insisting ldquorights-based issues at the heart of the impasse, such as Irish language protections, remained unresolved. --DUP MP Gavin Robinson with party MLA Gordon Lyons outside Stormont  --After holding talks with Mr Smith at Stormont, DUP MP Gavin Robinson declined to be drawn on the lack of a phone call between Mr Johnson and Mr Varadkar.ldquoI donrsquot think we need to get involved in who is phoning who why they havenrsquot phoned yet, he said.ldquoMatters between the British Government and the European Union will continue, they will engage in discussions and I have no doubt the Prime Minister and Taoiseach will discuss as well.Askedhe viewed it as a snub, Mr Robinson said: ldquoI think we have a new administration.

Dr Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office National Climate Information Centre, said: ldquoHistorically UK summer heatwaves would typically tend to peak in the low s Celsius, with extreme events reaching the mid-s.ldquoThe UK climate has been warming since the mid-th century, and this has been accompanied by similar increase in the hottest day of the year, which for the most recent decade has been .C higher when compared with the period -.ldquoClimate change has increased the likelihood and severity of heatwave episodes across Europe, which will have also increased the risks of a C temperature event in the UK.Professor Peter Stott, from the Met Office, said that while average global temperatures have risen by around C since the Industrial Revolution, some areas have warmed more quickly, with North Africa seeing rises of C.He said: ldquoThis can have a marked effect on UK weather because when the weather patterns, like we saw last week, bring air from this region to our shores, it can bring a stronger signal of climate change with it too, boosting temperatures.ldquoThe UK receives influences from other neighbouring regions and as many of these regions are warming at a faster rate than the UK, our climate can receive a greater boost from climate change.The Governmentrsquos advisory Committee on Climate Change has warned the UK is notprepared for the increase in heatwaves that is expected with global warming.Earlier this summer, it called for more action to make surehomes and other buildings such as hospitals and care facilities can be comfortable and safe in higher temperatures..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New temperature record set for UK in heatwave, Met Office confirms article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In all of the scenes the protagonist presented the other bears with two toys for them to share, but one bear quickly grabbed both toys, leaving none for the other bear.The children were then shown the protagonist either rectying this transgression by redistributing one of the toys from the wrongdoer bear to the victim bear.Or they watched the protagonist ignore the misbehaviour by approaching each bear and not redistributing a toy.University of Illinois psychology professor Renee Baillargeon, who led the research, said: ldquoInfants stared longer when the leader ignored the wrongdoing than when she rectied it.ldquoThis suggests that infants expected the leader to intervene and right the wrong in her group, and were surprised when she took no such action.When the leader ignored the transgression, the wrongdoer bear was also stared at for longer than the victim bear, as something about the wrongdoer would explain the leaderrsquos reluctance to correct her, researchers say.The toddlers seemed unsurprised when a protagonist who was not a leader failed to redress the same wrongdoing.The study was conducted in Baillargeonrsquos Infant Cognition Lab by graduate student Maayan Stavans, who then proceeded to postdoctoral studies on a Fulbright Fellowship at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel.She said: ldquoIn two experiments, infants consistently stared longer when leaders failed to act against wrongdoers.ldquoBut they held no particular expectation for intervention from non-leaders.In a third experiment, one of the bears announced it did not want a toy and the other bear took both toys.The children in this experiment stared longer when the leader intervened to make sure that each bear had one toy.ldquoIt was asthe infants understood that in this case there was no transgression, so they viewed it as overbearing for the leader to redistribute one of the toys to a bear who had made it clear she didnrsquot want one, Ms Stavans added.Researchers say the findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide new evidence that infants can reason about leaders.Professor Baillargeon said: ldquoWe knew from previous work that children this age have specic ideas about how followers will behave toward their leaders.ldquoNow we see that they also have complementary expectations about how leaders will behave toward their followers..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Parents who believe in showing children who is boss  umay be on right track u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so. This is what we are used to unfortunately. It is very sad that I have to say that but it is what our policing environment looks like here in Northern Ireland.“I think, even in terms of our response on Saturday morning in the early hours, it shows how alive we are to the possibilities with such devices. While it saddens me, it doesn’t surprise me.”try catch  TrendingPSNI probe after man dies suddenlyMumrsquos heartbreak after dog dies following lake swimScott Brown to be laid to restSafety concerns at state of land amid lsquoblame gamersquo over ownershipArrest after pound, of suspected heroin found in Co Armagh*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people.

However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically.

Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
