I live in a building with an autistic man who has bipolar, he has angry outbursts and last week said something really unkind, he struggles with understanding he’s in the wrong \u0026amp apologising but gave me this today.’‘Sometimes I say things in the heat of the moment I do not always mean.‘I hope you will accept my sorry gifts.‘Love from Christopher.‘P.S. I really do like you and your family and dog.’Ruby tells  that Christopher is normally ‘like a giant teddy bear’.She said: ‘He is mostly very sweet but has his moments where he can be irritable and unkind mainly due to his diagnosis on the autism spectrum and bipolar disorder.(Picture: Ruby King)‘The manager of the service told me Christopher was doing something for me, to give me some warning so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed, so I went about my afternoon of shopping in town and came back around 4pm.‘I am now aware that Christopher walked up to the local supermarket whilst I was out and bought me a card, cookies and a plant.‘He expressed to staff that he was feeling something strange in his stomach, they asked if he was nervous and he said yes, they explained that is called butterflies.‘Staff invited me downstairs to his flat and I went in, he couldn’t make eye contact with me but said here you go and gave me the cards and apology gifts.‘One of the staff was blubbering as this is a very out of character thing for Christopher to do. I read the card and started crying too as I was just so touched, I said to him “I know you hate hugs but tough I’m giving you one”.(Picture: Ruby King)‘So I quickly gave him a hug as he is not a fan of being touched and expressed my gratefulness for his apology and expressed that he didn’t need to have got me gifts, his apology would have been enough but thank you anyway.’According to Ruby, Christopher had seen her gardening a few days prior to the gifts and wanted to go out and join her but felt he couldn’t.She left the flat saying thank you again, as she was feeling very overwhelmed by the whole situation.She continued: ‘The next day I was leaving the building to go to my Grandma’s for the weekend and he shouted me out of his window and waved, of course, I waved back and I haven’t seen him since but everything is all good.‘I forgave him, I understand that it wasn’t him truly speaking, I’ve said things I’ve regretted when I haven’t been in a good frame of mind so I sympathise towards him.’Since sharing her tweet, Ruby has gone viral with more than 35,000 retweets and 230,000 likes.(Picture: Ruby King)She said she’s been absolutely ‘blown away’ by the response, telling us: ‘I had simply put it on to show my friends and followers the sweet gesture, as I share a lot of my life on Twitter as I am a blogger.‘I kept thinking it’s going to die down but as time went on it got crazier, my phone kept crashing I just couldn’t keep up with it.‘Out of thousands and thousands of repliesquoted tweets, I had a handful of negative responses, mainly about sharing his letter online. I chose to share it as there is such a misconception of autism that we are all non-verbal, illiterate and low functioning when that is far from the truth.‘Autism is a spectrum and some of the smartest people in the world are on this spectrum – they just display different difficulties to what people may expect from the stereotype.Ruby adds that soon, she’ll be moving out of her flat and into a more independent service.She would like to keep in touch with Christopher, but it will be difficult as she feels it could cause more harm than good.She tells us: ‘I think me leaving will upset him and if I stayed in touch he wouldn’t be able to move on‘Before I leave I will spend an evening with him, perhaps have a takeaway or go out for the day as I know he will miss my company greatly, as I will his.’MORE: How chronic illness and mental health are inextricably linkedMORE: Photographer’s emotional portraits will make you want to give your grandparents a call"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10923065.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"google unveils cyber secretary uses artificial intelligence make phone calls","story":"Google boss Sundar Pichai wants to help you (Provider: AP)You’ll soon be able to order your smartphone to make calls so you don’t have to do the unthinkable and speak to another human being.Google is working on artificial intelligence (AI) technology that is able to make phone calls on behalf of users to confirm reservations and appointments.The technology giant demonstrated the AI phoning a hair salon and a restaurant and interacting with real people to make bookings during its annual IO developer conference in California.Called Google Duplex, it works as an extension of the firm’s Google Assistant – the virtual helper that responds to voice commands – by making the calls in the background when users ask to make a reservation or appointment.Google Assistant can even draw shapes (AP PhotoJeff Chiu)Once the booking is made users are sent a notification confirming the time and date.Unveiling the technology at the company’s annual IO developer conference, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the firm was working hard to get the technology right, adding the company help to improve it further before releasing it.Artificial intelligence was a key theme at the event, where Google also laid out plans to use AI to help users spend less time on their phone and other devices.Mr Pichai unveiled features that use machine learning to understand user habits and help them switch off from their phone when necessary.Among the new features were notifications to YouTube urging users to take a break after watching a series of videos, as well as a new Dashboard app which shows users how they’re spending time on their phone as a way to improve time management.The firm also announced a new digital wellbeing site that would give advice on how to cut down on tech use.Google also unveiled changes to Android including a new ‘do not disturb’ mode (Provider: AP)Mr Pichai said Google hoped that rather than the “fear of missing out” (FOMO), the company wanted to help people discover the “joy of missing out” (JOMO).The event was also used to provide a first look at the next version of the Android mobile operating system.Currently known as Android P, the new software will also use AI heavily to help streamline battery use to only the most frequently used apps.A new feature called App Actions will also suggest apps based on previous habits, as well as specific actions within those apps on the same basis.Android users will soon also be able to automatically turn on Do Not Disturb mode on their device by turning it face-down, a feature Google says its engineers have dubbed Shush.The technology giant confirmed a beta version of the new Android P would be available on some Android devices from Tuesday, but has not yet confirmed a full release date for the software.Also during the keynote, a new Smart Compose feature for Gmail was introduced, which will provide predictive phrase and typing options as an email is written.The Google Assistant will also receive a range of new voice updates later this year, including the voice of singer John Legend, while the Google Lens camera tool can now be used as part of navigation in Google Maps.An update to Google News was also confirmed, with a re-designed feed and wider range of sources being included within the app."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8747000000578-5703293-image-m-23_1525779465935.jpg","title":"Extraordinary snaps joyful Meghan Markle Italian holiday date Prince Harry","story":"    Meghan\u0027s unofficial wedding planner and best friend Jessica Mulroney posted this picture on Instagram in August 2016 – a month after Meghan had her first date with Harry.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable. Meghan looks up to Jessica and has, to a certain degree, modelled herself on her.\u0027     Jessica is Meghan\u0027s best friend and will be there when she marries Harry at Windsor Castle on May 19. Meghan is known to lean on her best friend for style and fashion advice          Jessica\u0027s pictures give a revealing insight into the fun nature of their friendship including the time when Meghan invited her backstage on Suits where she looks through wedding dresses          Meghan Markle is reportedly set to wear a Ralph and Russo gown (not pictured)  when she walks down the aisle at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor on May 19Unlike Meghan, the former Jessica Brownstein, came from a privileged background as a member of Canada\u0027s Browns shoes dynasty, which is worth a reported £50 million.She attended an exclusive all-girls\u0027 school, before going to McGill University, where she studied industrial relations and economics. She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence. Meghan\u0027s turned to her for advice on everything from the dress, the flowers, decorations in church, the wedding lunch — and even the seating plan. \u0027Although Jess lives in Toronto, the two are on the phone all the time. Meg wanted Jess at the final fitting as it\u0027ll be the most famous dress of the year and she\u0027s quite nervous about it. It all went really well and they were delighted with the result.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF87BE700000578-5703381-image-m-12_1525779072907.jpg","title":"Cannes Film Festival no longer let critics movies red carpet","story":"    Cannes has cancelled all advance press screenings so actors and filmmakers\u0027 of bad films don\u0027t have their spirits crushed before the premiereStars would walk down the red carpet blissfully unaware that their film had been given scathing one-star reviews.That model was \u0027blown to bits\u0027 by the internet where reviews on news websites, film blogs, and social media were posted within hours, or even minutes, of the screening.Organisers insisted the first major change to the festival programme in decades was \u0027necessary\u0027 to protect the egos of stars.\u0027The underlying logic was was based on best practice blown to bits by the massive incursion of digital technologies in our professional and personal lives over the past 15 years or so,\u0027 it wrote in a letter to the press seen by The Telegraph.\u0027Basically, as soon as the film is screened, the social networks turn it into confetti-like strips of rumours.\u0027  In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron (left) as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s (right, with Theron) career          Earlier in 2012, Nicole Kidman had to walk the red carpet after a scene in The Paperboy where her character (pictured) urinates on the one played by Zac Effron made newsThe letter said the new principle was to make the gala session attended by the people who made the film the \u0027veritable first screening\u0027.\u0027When the team walks the red carpet and enters the room... the moment will be far more powerful as no one will have already seen the film,\u0027 it read.Academy of Motion Pictures expels convicted indecent...Kate Winslet urges women to cover up on the red carpet as...Share this articleNumerous Hollywood stars have been glum-faced or asked uncomfortable questions as they walked the red carpet after bad reviews at recent Cannes events.In 2016 critics savaged The Last Face starring Charlize Theron as the lowest point of actor-director Sean Penn\u0027s career.

The usual suspects were there – those who spoke on the duke\u0027s little rebellion included that interminable Euro-groupie and former diplomat Lord Hannay, and his fellow crossbencher Lord Butler, once cabinet secretary. There may have been many more who voted when the House ided, but the actual debate was under-attended.Most peers know where they stand on Brexit, and it is not on the side of the majority who voted in the 2016 referendum. They were elsewhere on the parliamentary estate yesterday. I bet the bars were doing brisk business.           He helped bring about another defeat for Theresa May (pictured) and her ministers. And usAnd so we come to the Duke of Wellington, nominally a follower of the Tory Whip but, on this issue, happy to ignore his political affiliation in favour of his apparently stronger loyalty to the European Elite Party.I merely note that his duchess, Antonia, is a Princess of Prussia. He himself, Charles Valerian Wellesley OBE, DL, with more titles than a champion boxer, after schooling at Eton, has had a business career, home and abroad.He is a member of Portugal\u0027s Order of Merit and he holds the Grand Cross of the Spanish Order of Isobel the Catholic.

Noo noo, of course not. Dear heart, the thought never crossed our minds.He argued simply that it was a frightful bind for ministers to have to work with the burden of this set date for our departure. How much more they could achieve if that date were not there!Lord Butler, from what I could understand, sought to suggest that dropping the date might actually allow Brexit to be delayed for ever, but the duke did not want to pursue that idea.Eurosceptic opposition came from Lord Grocott, a Labour peer who has had to put up with some pretty bad heckling in recent months (his party colleagues at the far end of the Palace of Westminster hate him for siding with the voters).He recalled Parkinson\u0027s Law, which states that \u0027work expands to fill the time available\u0027 and he suspected that the Europhiles were merely attempting to hold up Brexit. His voice went unheeded and the duke\u0027s dismal little delay was approved by a House that, with every day, looks riper for the abattoir.Does this sort of thing help the Remainers? To have an hereditary peer, one of the most blue of all blue-bloods, helping their cause? I suspect not. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/01/4BE4CDC200000578-0-image-m-13_1525824778289.jpg","title":"Sir Cliff Richard hopes win 600 000 BBC","story":"    Sir Cliff Richard, 77, has sued the BBC over coverage of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in August 2014Sir Cliff Richard is seeking to extract at least £560,000 from the BBC if his landmark privacy action over a child sex crime investigation succeeds, a court heard yesterday.The 77-year-old superstar has sued the BBC over coverage of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in August 2014 and wants damages at the ‘top end’ of the scale.The singer has told Mr Justice Mann that coverage, which involved the use of a helicopter, was a ‘very serious invasion’ of his privacy.The BBC disputes his claims.

Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone.

It\u0027s been a long time coming, but maybe we can turn the page on class lists for now.\u0027In a tight vote, the fellows of Regent House, which include academics and other key figures, approved the call for students to have the opportunity to opt out from having their names and exam results published in the class lists.          Cambridge is the only university in Britain to publicly display class lists after Oxford abolished them in 2009. Pictured: The Senate House and Kings College (left)Class lists are currently posted on notice boards outside Senate House, published in the Cambridge University Reporter, and are also published online.In the vote, 412 members of Regent House voted in favour, with 391 against, it was revealed today in Varsity, the university\u0027s in-house newspaper.Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education said: \u0027I welcome the result of the ballot which means that all students are now able to choose to opt out from having their names published outside the Senate House or in the Reporter.\u0027This opt out will be implemented immediately. Faculties, departments and colleges will still have access to the full class list for their own internal purposes.\u0027Previously, students could only opt out in exceptional circumstances, after a lengthy, bureaucratic process, and only 86 names were omitted last year.   Campaigners at the university, which has about 21,000 students from all round the world, claimed having their result made public for all to see could affect the mental health of some people.They said the lists are \u0027damaging\u0027 to welfare, can trigger depression and \u0027promote a culture of naming and shaming\u0027.But supporters said it would be sad if a tradition dating back nearly 300 years was abolished.  Until now, applications from students wanting to have their names removed are only considered in \u0027exceptional circumstances. Under the new system, every student can simply tick a box which states they wish to opt out. Martha Krish, students\u0027 union education officer, said last year that the lists had caused \u0027distress and harm\u0027 to countless students and the new system was \u0027a massive improvement\u0027. Oxford University has kept exam results private since October 2009 after 40 per cent of students opted out, citing the Data Protection Act. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/11/4C021B4D00000578-0-image-a-3_1525863038907.jpg","title":"Britains heatwave comes abrupt end temperatures set plummet","story":"    A woman makes the most of the warm weather at St James\u0027s Park in London today as she relaxes on a bench  Commuters, walkers and runners make their way along the edge of the boating lake at Regent\u0027s Park today          A woman runs past the boating lake as a beautiful morning greets Londoners at Regent\u0027s Park today          A man and women enjoy a spot of lunch as sun seekers make the most of the weather at St James\u0027s Park today  Two dogs run along a footpath, while a woman does the same at Regent\u0027s Park in London on a sunny day this morning          A woman lies on the grass at St James\u0027s Park today, as temperatures remain warm before tailing off later this weekMaximum temperatures recorded over the weekend were 79.3F (26.3C) on Sunday, and 74.7F (23.7C) on Saturday.

Among the works of art for sale at Christie’s in Manhattan on Tuesday evening were a Rose period portrait by Pablo Picasso that sold for $115m (including fees) and a painting by Monet from his water garden series that sold for a record $80.7m.The auction saw the sale of 44 lots in total from Rockefeller’s lauded modern art collection, including celebrated works by Paul Gauguin, Henri Matisse and Georgia O’Keeffe.The highlight of the Tuesday sale in New York was Young Girl with a Flower Basket, a 1905 painting by Pablo Picasso which fetched $115m, the second-highest price at auction for the artist.Paintings by Monet and Matisse also garnered new record prices for the artists. Monet’s Water Lilies in Bloom, completed between 1914 and 1917, sold for a record $84.6m and Matisse’s Odalisque reclining with magnolias sold for a record $80.7m.Christie’s says the proceeds will be distributed to a number of philanthropies Rockefeller and his wife, Peggy, supported in their lifetimes.Rockefeller was the last surviving grandson of Standard Oil founder John D Rockefeller when he died in March 2017 at the age of 101.

In the book, Wilkie Collins keeps Marian Halcombe at the home, moving in with her sister Laura and brother-in-law Walter to become a surrogate parent to their children (and, according to some literary critics, throwing a semi-incestuous sapphic ner in to the works). The BBC adaptation instead whisked Marian away to go travelling around the world – possible, although not easy for a single woman in the 19th century.But that wasn’t the first break with the source material that the BBC’s take gave us. Because while Jessie Buckley is spirited and delightful in the role, she’s far too pretty to be Marian . One of the greatest heroines of Victorian literature, Marian is introduced in Collin’s novel through Walter Hartright’s rather voyeuristic eyes. Walter drools over his future sister-in-law from afar, particularly her figure – “visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays” – at least until he gets close enough to see her face: “Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted – never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the head that crowned it. The lady’s complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her lip was almost a moustache.” As Cher Horowitz from Clueless might put it, she’s a total Monet (great from a distance, but a mess up close).Buckley is the latest in a long line of striking women actors trying to “plain up” – Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot (“her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her”), Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet (“the only plain one in the family”), Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre (“Don’t address me as if I were a beauty, I am your plain Quakerish Governess”) – and just the latest attractive woman to play Marian: there was Diana Quick in the 1982 TV adaptation, Tara Fitzgerald in the 1997 film, then Maria Friedman in the oddly compelling musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2004.But what is “ugly” in literature can only go as far as “unconventionally beautiful” on telly, it seems. The latest Woman in White is yet another example of sexed up adaptations even the creepy Count Fosco, described in the novel as approaching 60 and “corpulent”, is played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who is visibly neither. With Fosco, Collins was manipulating a prevailing Victorian idea that all fat people were jolly and inoffensive, unsettling readers by introducing a villain in the guise of comic relief. On a practical level, these changes make sense: Marian is such a scene-stealer that Walter needs a reason to prefer with Laura over her, while the complicated nature of Marian and Fosco’s interactions boils over into sexual tension, as opposed to stomach-churning sleaze.But perhaps there is another reason why we’re meant to find Marian unattractive, why the reader is supposed to take Walter’s preference for blonde-haired Laura for granted. Marian is “swarthy”, Walter says, and Laura describes her sister’s “dear Gypsy face”. That, plus the “thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead”, seems a a clear indication Collins didn’t envisage his heroine as being white. Although much has been written about Heathcliff’s skin tone in Wuthering Heights, Marian’s race seems to have flown under the radar. It’s a minor point of scholarly debate, but when it comes to an adaptation it becomes flagrant whitewashing – a lead role in a primetime period drama going to an actress of colour could be a career game-changer, not to mention reminding viewers that the Victorian period was nowhere near as white as we’ve been led to believe.The latest Woman in White played fast and loose with its source material, but if the producers had wanted to break with convention, there was a far more faithful – and radical – way they could have done it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7a6e9e7657f6b5bd0877bca6cddc1da01df39c8/57_0_1713_1028/master/1713.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3be7776a6455c975b9e1726c732dfb5","title":"pro europeans single market lords vote brexit","story":"Pro-Europeans shouldn’t get too excited that the House of Lords voted for us to stay in the single market on Tuesday night.Quitting Europe’s vast market, as Theresa May plans, would be bad for jobs and bad for the NHS because we would have less money to pay for it. But staying in the single market would turn us from being a rule-maker into a rule-taker. That would be bad for our power and bad for our pride.The only way to protect jobs and public services while remaining one of Europe’s most powerful nations is to stay in the EU. And the best way of achieving that is to get a people’s vote on the Brexit deal.Campaigning to stay in the single market could distract from that goal – and, at worst, undermine it.That, of course, isn’t the way peers who voted for Tuesday’s amendment see things. Some think it could be the thin end of the wedge.Get MPs to agree that we should to stay in the single market and it is only a matter of time before they realise that we should cancel Brexit. After all, what’s the point in being bound by all the single market’s rules if you no longer have a vote on them?Maybe things will play out this way. But it doesn’t seem very likely.The amendment to the EU withdrawal bill agreed in the House of Lords will become law only if it is backed by the House of Commons. And, for that to happen, the Labour party and at least 10 Tory rebels would need to support it.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations, security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays which will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as carmaking could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.Although many ordinary Labour members would like us to stay in the single market, Jeremy Corbyn is opposed to us doing so. His main beef is that it would require us to allow free movement of people, and many voters would see backing that as a betrayal of the referendum.Without the Labour leadership’s support, the amendment cannot survive in the Commons. It’s also doubtful how many Tory rebels will be willing to stick their heads above the parapet. Although some would like to stay in the single market, they pick their battles – only rebelling when they think they can win. What’s the point in becoming cannon fodder if there’s no victory in sight?But the main problem with pushing single-market membership isn’t the slim chance of success. It is that, in doing so, campaigners could undermine the case for staying in the EU.This is because the Brexit deal the prime minister eventually negotiates – if she can ever get her cabinet to agree on anything – is likely to require us to follow many EU rules without a vote on them. We will need to attack it on the basis that we are losing control, not taking it back – exactly the opposite of what Boris Johnson and his clique promised two years ago.The snag is, if campaigners push for single-market membership now, they will be vulnerable to the charge of hypocrisy if they attack the final Brexit deal for turning us into rule-takers. The obvious riposte will be that only a few months before, they were recommending that we should follow the whole suite of single-market rules without a vote on them.What’s more, if we did, against expectations, manage to secure single-market membership, that wouldn’t be the end of the matter. The British people are a proud nation. They wouldn’t put up with a situation where, year after year, our parliament would have to rubber-stamp legislation coming down from Brussels. Johnson’s charge that we were being turned into a “vassal state” could start to ring true.Optimistic pro-Europeans will say Rome wasn’t built in a day. After a few years in the single market, we could decide to rejoin the EU as full members with our voting rights restored.Maybe. But, again, that’s not the most likely scenario. After all, if we ask to go back into the EU after quitting the bloc, we would lose our budget rebate and might even be forced to give up the pound and join the single currency. It would be hard to persuade the British people to do that.In such circumstances, Nigel Farage would probably be back with a vengeance, demanding that we have a proper Brexit that restores our freedom – and he might be unstoppable. We’d then be out of the single market and into the hardest and most damaging Brexit imaginable.Pro-Europeans should be careful what they wish for. They shouldn’t be distracted by the campaign to stay in the single market. They should keep their eyes on the main prize – securing a people’s vote on the Brexit deal and then persuading the public that they are better off staying in the EU after all.• Hugo Dixon is chairman and editor-in-chief of InFacts, a founding member of the People’s Vote campaign"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09ff10f09928d4d40efde8da63b459a6e6c4f3b4/712_937_2773_1664/master/2773.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f047dbabc410607762f932ac63d621","title":"progressive alliance labour local election tories","story":"When polling stations close on Election day, democracy really begins. Campaigners inhale instant coffee, administer eye drops and sharpen their pencils and elbows in preparation for The Count. This peculiar nocturnal event is as mysterious and exciting as a trading floor. It is also a rare glimpse into the dysfunction of our politics.After checking that all ballot papers are properly accounted for, counters begin sorting them into piles to work out how many votes were cast for each candidate. For political parties, the aim of the game is to make sure all of your candidate’s votes are counted. When a doubtful ballot is discovered – for example the bloke in Hackney who apparently drew a picture of a penis next to the Women’s Equality party – your job is to argue that the voting intention is clear. Other parties try to argue the opposite or prevent you from seeing a rejected ballot in the first place.The onward march of dealignment is no longer about weakened party loyalty or a referendum on the government’s record, it is about voters choosing and judging parties according to their promises and performance. It is a desire for our votes to count for more in this broken two-party system. The Women’s Equality party is only three years old and yet in this, our first local election, around a quarter of voters in our target areas gave one of their three votes to us. Across the country we beat candidates from all the established parties.It is an achievement that brought tears to my eyes as the final votes were tallied, because every single one of those votes had to be earned on the doorstep in a political system that excludes us, with less access to funds and press attention for smaller parties. And because each vote counts for so much more, mainstream parties contort themselves to look like the parties that are “stealing their votes” – just look at the disproportionate influence of Ukip. The newly elected Sheffield city region mayor, Dan Jarvis, has offered our Sheffield branch a place on his scrutiny committee. In Lewisham, where we took our highest number of votes, it is believed that Labour will put forward an all-female BAME shortlist to contest Heidi Alexander’s seat.The challenge for Labour is that most splitting occurs between ideologically adjacent parties, and because less partisan Labour voters are more likely than Conservatives to split their vote. It was of no surprise, therefore, that there have been renewed calls for a progressive alliance from key Labour MPs. In an open letter, signed by Clive Lewis and Jon Cruddas, they argued that cooperation with other progressive parties at last Thursday’s local elections could have tipped the balance in close-fought councils, just as it could have delivered a Labour-led government in 2017. They are right. In Bromley and Enfield, Labour candidates fell short by a margin of less than the Women’s Equality party votes, while in Richmond the Liberal DemocratGreen alliance saw off the Tory challenge for a second time. When parties with distinct but progressive platforms work together to ensure plurality on councils, we win.But here’s the thing, Corbynism is ideologically purist – just look at what’s happened in Haringey where internal battles have intensified tribalism within the party. Making pacts within Labour is hard enough, let alone outside of it. Labour councillors hold 47 out of 48 seats in Jeremy Corbyn’s constituency and a powerful core in Labour believes that it is possible to replicate that success across the country, despite all signs to the contrary. Thursday’s results showed the limits of that strategy once more, as Labour struggled past the not-very-high bar set by Ed Miliband, and the Conservatives showed stubborn support despite the horror of Windrush and near universal boredom with endless Brexit debates.The other progressive parties know that an alliance is the only way to deliver a progressive government, short of a change to the voting system. Wishing this wasn’t the electoral reality doesn’t make it so. But they also know that Labour is not ready to accept that, and this latest push from within the party is nothing more than a fig leaf. Because even if Labour could agree to an alliance, it will only ever agree to one in which another party stands down to secure its victory. And that is not an alliance at all.• Hannah Peaker is chief of staff for the Women’s Equality party"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af93ebfa418fa9cfb2f15624771d3c291639985a/0_384_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d384d23da2881de98cb18e11b848d7bf","title":"shopping centre currency hope newcastle under lyme","story":"Commerce has deserted Newcastle-under-Lyme’s town centre. The latest in our new economics series looks at how the community is filling the gap • Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastFor years, all Mike Riddell has seen in his trade is failure and death. But today he’s at a birth – and all his hope rests on it. A new cafe is opening in the shopping centre he manages and they are throwing a party. Having brought along his wife and mum, 53-year-old Riddell goes into “full-on host mode”, chatting up council officials and swapping elaborate handshakes with teenagers. Yes Sir, I Can Boogie blasts out of the stereo, and some obliging soul in a Spider-Man costume complies. Over all the music and chat, you can hear the free ping-pong tables getting a pounding. Yes sir, clip-clop, clip-clop, I can boogie, clip-clop, clip-clop.Through the big windows, you can see the world Riddell normally faces – and it’s desolate. No babble, no mucking about. Hardly anyone clip-clops past. On this Tuesday lunchtime at York Place, the most tired shopping centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, just outside Stoke, there are few actual shoppers.After decades building and running shopping centres across the country, Riddell has looked after York Place for two tough years. He let out this same entrance cafe to a can-do pair at the end of 2017. They lasted a few months before giving up, leaving behind the tables, chairs and a stove for whoever else wanted to try their luck. It would be hard for anyone, but especially for Riddell, who is one of life’s enthusiasts. He zooms down conversational detours about his great love, northern soul, and its debt to miners’ culture. And he never wears a poker face. Ask how important this successor cafe is and he admits: “Fucking vital. We need to make this work.”At rock bottom, eight of York Place’s 35 units stood vacant. Still today, bare shopfronts are as obvious as missing teeth. Next door at the fancier Roebuck Centre, the Early Learning Centre, Argos and Primark have all disappeared. Even the charity shops are vanishing. For centuries, Newcastle, as locals call it, has been a bustling market town. Today the market is retreating and the town’s very identity is under threat.York Place is at the eye of a storm that has either already hit your home town or is looming over it. Last year 5,855 shops closed in Britain, the most since 2010. If today is in line with the average, by this evening a net total of five shops will have given up the ghost.In our long post-crash slump, trusted names are either shutting down or cutting back: Woolworths, Comet, Blockbuster, Maplin, Jaeger, Toys R Us, BHS... As British wages continue to flatline, more closures will follow. Just last week, the 169-year-old chain House of Fraser announced plans to begin insolvency proceedings .These inidual business failures amount collectively to a disease eating away at small-town centres and suburban high streets. It advances in stages: first out are the brand names and chains then shoppers with cars after that, in come the charity shops and betting dens. What’s left are ghost towns, abandoned by all bar schoolchildren and pensioners.“Walk around Newcastle at three in the afternoon and a lot of the cafes are empty,” says Andy Arnott, a senior local council officer. “Come five, everybody finishes work and leaves town.”I can see why a retailer already battling Lidl or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos might pass over Newcastle. It’s a bit too close to Stoke to draw its own footfall. It lies in a region built on mining and potteries, where prosperity is now a fading memory. In a country that simply has too many shops, executives have little use for Newcastle and other places, from Dartford to Newport to Dewsbury. What, apart from shopping, will they do now? What, indeed, does a country built on debt and consumption do when it’s exhausted that model? These are questions that Westminster has barely even clocked, let alone tried to answer.David Cameron got Mary “Queen of Shops” Portas to write a report on “distressed town centres”, then so roundly ignored her proposals that she attacked his “PR campaign”. Since 2011 there have been seven high street ministers in as many years. So weighty have been their interventions, I bet you didn’t even know there was such a thing as a high street minister.Which leaves it up to towns to fix their own gutted centres, using whatever tools they can find. Dumfries has a “doon toon army” of locals bidding to buy derelict shops. In Newcastle, Riddell and his colleagues already have a plan. They’re turning York Place into a post-shopping centre.Its anchor tenant – the big shop to draw in passing trade – isn’t an H\u0026ampM or a Wilko, but a charity: the YMCA. Rather than a traditional charity shop, it’s selling jewellery and other work hand-made by local artists, and runs arts and crafts workshops for residents of all ages. And as of last Tuesday, the cornerstone cafe is Cultural Squatters, a social enterprise that markets itself as the “anti-Costa”. It serves instant coffee at £1 a mug alongside those Staffordshire specialities, lobby (stew) and oatcakes. Staff include adult volunteers with learning disabilities.Where shopping centres are normally stuffed full of chains, York Place is now a hub for local independents. Where landlords usually demand maximum rent, Riddell has cajoled his London-based client into accepting two non-profits in return for reduced business rates.It’s a pragmatic way of reclaiming commercial space for a community – and it’s buttressed by a reward scheme launched by Riddell and his colleagues at Manchester-based consultancy HometownPlus. Called CounterCoin, it’s like a Tesco Clubcard – except you earn points not by spending, but by doing something for the community. Help out at a YMCA workshop, say, and you’ll get clay tokens that entitle you to bargain off-peak sessions at the neighbourhood bowling alley, or discounts from the local Spar on food about to pass its best-before date. “If we can dole out points for being a zombie consumer at Tesco, why can’t we give points for doing some good in the community?” says Riddell.“Genius,” says Arnott, who plans to add more of the council’s leisure facilities to the scheme.Again, this is commonsense radicalism: retrieving things discarded by the market, whether shops or goods or people, and giving them a social value.That’s true of the abandoned plot now occupied by Cultural Squatters. It’s also true of its founder, Narina Stead, who fixed up her cafe despite a broken arm and torn ligaments. Painting hurt, she admits, but “I’m too busy for a sling”.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently?

Another relationship broke her mental health, forcing her out of work and on to benefits. She used the time to get a first-class English degree, then “boshed out” a master’s, finishing both in three years. Yet in a jobs market as slack as north Staffordshire, it would be an unusual employer who would bother looking past her long-term unemployment to see her brains and stamina. What about the state? A couple of months ago, it was chasing her for bedroom tax. Only Riddell offered her a shot at a business. It’s hard graft that has still to pay, but when she blurts out “This is my baby!”, her pride needs no underlining.Pinned to the noticeboard of the York Place offices are not charts of till receipts or footfall – but a graph depicting how many person-hours have been poured into the local community through the shopping centre. However crude, it’s an attempt to measure social value, and I’ll bet 10 CounterCoin that no other mall anywhere in the country charts such a thing.“It’s no ordinary shopping centre. It’s a laboratory,” says Julie Froud, a professor at Alliance Manchester Business School, who is conducting an independent evaluation of York Place.It lacks investment, as shown by the cluster of buckets to catch leaks in the entrance. The ideas are rough around the edges, and many of those involved are working on goodwill. But at least the centre only has one faraway landlord activists in Dumfries are having to barter with a number of absentee owners.In this lies a lesson for any opposition party that wants to offer disaffected voters a means of taking back control: make it easier for communities to repossess derelict properties. Most of all, Froud notes: “This is a group of people all trying to make things happen.”And trying to change a broken model. It’s often assumed that this hyper-consumerist culture of debt and spending is intrinsically British – yet it is a recent invention. As late as the 1960s, the historian Frank Trentmann notes in his 2016 book Empire of Things, furniture bought on hire purchase would be delivered in “plain vans” so as to not to shame a family. Then, between the mid-70s and the mid-90s, the number of Britons with credit facilities tripled.With that began the giant boom for the shopping business – including for Riddell, who built malls from Newport to Crewe. He drives me to see one of his last shopping malls, the Grand Arcade in Wigan. It opened in March 2007, “pretty much the same day as Warrington, only 20 miles away, had a massive extension to its shopping centre. The Trafford centre had just had one too. Preston, Chorley – they were all at the same game.”Then Britain’s credit system failed. “The banks were like, ‘That umbrella we lent you when it was sunny, can we have it back now it’s raining?’ We had a shopping centre in Wakefield half-built, and the banks stopped the funding.”Since the company’s huge loans were backed by the partners, Riddell had to hold his own closing-down sale and liquidate almost everything he owned. He went from being worth millions to being tens of millions in debt. The family home was only saved by cash from his father-in-law. He also donated the nine-year-old car we’re now in.“Those bastards in the banking system” are, in his eyes, “drug dealers. They want to get their cocaine out, and they’re bonused up to find people like us. ‘Here, d’you want more stuff?’ Then when the drugs ran out, they came and kicked our doors in and scared our wives.”Now he holds no bank account, and buys precious little. Having been spat out of the debt-consumerist complex, he wants nothing more to do with it.As we park up outside his glory days, he sighs: “Weird, being back here.” The Grand Arcade was built on the site of the Wigan Casino, and there is by the vast cafe a shrine to northern soul: guitars, posters and seven-inch singles.Still, he remembers, local traders hated the mall for sucking the life out of the local high street. Now it has its own voids: both TK Maxx and Monsoon have left. Riddell takes a long, mystified look at the temple he built, deserted at closing time.“Retail,” he finally says. “It’s dead, innit?”• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may portrait students","story":"Free speech rows at universities have become central to the recent culture war: an easy way to lambast snowflaky students, the latest thing to induce eye-rolling and groans about “political correctness gone mad”. The most recent involves Theresa May, whose portrait was moved from the attic in which it has been mysteriously degrading to be included in a display of famous female geography alumnae at Oxford’s school of geography and the environment.Students then stuck messages around the painting arguing that, as Brexit trundles on and the Windrush scandal continues, the prime minister’s image went against the ersity and inclusivity that the school – and geography as a subject – should stand for. Academics also argued that an institution with an intellectual responsibility to hold power to account should not be honouring a head of government in this way.The portrait was removed for its own safety, but may be reinstated – all in a dizzying cyclone of denouncements and counter-denouncements on social media, a hashtag (#NotAllGeographers, naturally), and a pushback from Tory politicians. “Even portraits are being no-platformed”, tweeted the universities minister, Sam Gyimah, who declared the row “utterly ridiculous”.I doubt many people are preoccupying themselves with whether a picture of Theresa May should be displayed on a wall of an elitist academic institution, the inside of which most of us are unlikely to ever see. I suspect the only reason these Tory politicians care is that so many of them went there, and feeling rejected by the institution that primed them for power feels like a slap in the face.But what I am interested in is why these rows gain so much traction now – what is it about the times we live in that this story is making the news? (And yes, I recognise the irony in the fact that I am writing about this now). Because the thing is, students and academics have been having slightly tedious rows about the relative merits of displaying, inviting, funding or discussing – insert literally anything here – for years. They were certainly doing it when I was there indeed, it’s one of the main reasons many avoided student politics, and they were definitely doing it in the 1970s.It’s partly what universities are for, this revising and unpicking and interrogating of history and politics. Even if people such as myself would rather stay in bed than listen to it, most students recognise it as part and parcel of the university experience. Does it even count as an institute of higher education if there isn’t some kind of boycott or strike or occupation going on?Couple that with the fact that humanities subjects have long included the study of colonialism and its legacies in their syllabuses, and you do wonder what has changed to make this suddenly so controversial. As we reflect on the 50 years since the student uprisings in May 1968, I don’t think students are more radical today than they ever were. This portrait was not torn down or even defaced with a Hitler moustache – a direction certain writers might have once been inclined to follow instead it was surrounded by polite messages written on multicoloured bits of paper. Letters were written, hashtags were tweeted, and people acknowledged that having a female prime minister – the second only in history – is worthy of note despite other objections. These are hardly credible threats to establishment power. So why does the establishment care?One reason is, I imagine, the imperialism to which the students object. If you think that there aren’t people in government and the media today, in 2018, who believe the British empire was A Good Thing, then you are kidding yourself. Students are better aware of race issues, too, and more vocal about them. These underrepresented voices are amplified by social media.But the biggest factor in all this, I believe, is simple ageism. At a time when intergenerational injustice is rife, and the debate about what is fair and what isn’t becomes fraught, some will take any opportunity to take potshots at 21-year-old “snowflakes”.Universities are easy pickings, with kids challenging their elders all over the shop. And with many other industries and institutions top-heavy with baby boomers unwilling to make room for new blood, perhaps there are few opportunities to see what youngsters are up to. In fact, perhaps boredom and fear of cultural stagnation has led to this sudden attention. Perhaps, in a funny way, it’s something of a compliment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e173187867150d2fc9f023073161a44bfc94904/0_0_3488_2092/master/3488.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5cb39826df4fc9f74c27002c02c9bef","title":"tories southern red south england london","story":"The south of England is becoming more like London as young people move out. It’s a timebomb for the ConservativesMore than 1 million people moved out of London over the last four years – and three-quarters of those people now live in the south of England. This is the picture according to Office for National Statistics: its internal migration figures show tens of thousands arrived in places such as Canterbury, Brighton, Thurrock, Medway, Dartford, Luton, Slough, and Welwyn Garden City. Over the same four-year period, 750,000 people arrived in London from elsewhere.Last October I explained how demographic changes helped to explain the relatively poor performance of the Conservatives in the south of England in last year’s general election. People leaving London are setting up home across the south in their hundreds of thousands, and as a result changing the composition of both London and the south. Now we at Election Data are examining the demographic trends more deeply, with a poll of ex-Londoners’ voting behaviours.Meanwhile, London continues to suck in young students, graduates and twentysomethings from across the country. (Nearly 750,000 people have arrived in the capital over the past four years.) This means a net inflow of these younger, better-educated voters – so London gets younger and younger, while outlying towns, within commuting distance of the capital, see a large influx from London. In effect, London is attracting better-educated young people, who in time are deposited back into commuter-belt towns surrounding the metropolis. The political effects of these significant patterns can be seen in elections since 2015.Across the south, places including Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Reading, Windsor and Maidenhead, Wokingham, High Wycombe, Winchester, Tunbridge Wells, Oxfordshire, Epsom, Guildford, Cheltenham, Exeter, Brighton, Bristol, Bath and Stroud – many of the destinations of choice for Londoners – voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union.In the 2017 general election, not only did the Conservatives lose seats in Brighton, Bedford, Canterbury, Ipswich, Stroud, Eastbourne, Peterborough, Reading and Oxford – but many seats across the south saw a swing from the Conservatives to Labour.Since the general election there have been more than 600 local byelections in councils across Britain.In the south of England the Conservatives have been suffering:In the local elections last week, the Conservatives lost control of Mole Valley, Plymouth, Kingston-upon-Thames, and South Cambridgeshire, while also losing vote share in wards across the region. So at the same time as the development of significant migration patterns, the political makeup of the south has changed. The obvious question is: are the two events related? One way to find out would be to ask those people who have left London how they have voted in recent general elections and the European referendum.Historically speaking, you might have expected these voters to be much more Conservative. Many can be described as affluent young families with suburban mindsets. Seven in 10 are ABC1 social grade. However, over the last two years they have moved from supporting the Conservatives, then the remain side in the European referendum, and now Labour.Slowly but surely, parts of the south of England are becoming a little bit more like London. If these trends continue we can expect the south’s political makeup to become more like London too. The results of recent elections bear this out, and this polling shows us why.• Ian Warren is director of the consultancy Election Data• This article was co-written with Chris Curtis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b2890f29803799a537d4dd9b9625e4497c44254/0_0_5221_3482/master/5221.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=292b70df4e70be5118a84fc18abe03ef 700w","title":"running wild five of the best national park runs","story":"Boost your stamina by hitting a national park trail, where natural wonders will push you to new heightsLength: 4 milesTime: 50 minutesStartfinish: Loch Morlich Beach car park (OS Explorer OL57)Grade: EasyAscent: 164 feet (50 metres)Terrain: Wide gravel paths and forest trailsRefuel: Glenmore Visitor Centre cafe (PH22 1QU)Home to the highest mountains in the UK, the Cairngorms national park is known for its snowy plateaux and abundant Munros (hills over 3,000ft914 metres). But don’t let the extreme landscape put you off lacing up your trainers, as among the lofty peaks are swathes of ancient native forests and hidden lochs to explore on foot – and you won’t need to pack an ice-axe or crampons. This gentle route takes you on a clockwise circuit of Loch Morlich, a tranquil stretch of water surrounded by woodland and fringed by sandy beaches at the foot of the northern Cairngorms. For most of the waymarked route you’ll be running through open pine forest, glimpsing views of Loch Morlich and the stunning backdrop of rounded, often snow-covered mountains mirrored in its still water. The area is a haven for wildlife – it’s worth pausing to catch your breath at one of the many burns (streams) that feed the loch, for a chance to spot dippers, wagtails and herons. As you continue around the loch keep an eye out for red squirrels darting up trees and golden eagles soaring overhead. Once you’ve completed the four-mile loop, there’s always the option to finish with a bracing dip in the water at Loch Morlich beach, famous for being one of the highest in Britain.Length: 3.8 milesTime: 1 hourStartfinish: Whitesands car park (OS Explorer OL35)Grade: ModerateAscent: 392ft (119 metres)Terrain: Coastal path and heathlandRefuel: Whitesands beach cafe (SA62 6PS)Following a section of the long-distance Pembrokeshire Coast Path, this 3.8-mile circular route around St David’s Head packs plenty into its short length. And what it lacks in mileage it more than makes up for with a magnificent seascape dominated by Ramsey Island and an archipelago of rocky islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. As you follow the undulating coast path towards the rugged peninsula of St David’s Head, it’s worth looking back at the curving mile-long sandy beach of Whitesands Bay with its rolling surf breaks. Along with breathtaking coastal views and plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, the route passes two prehistoric monuments: Coetan Arthur, a 5,000-year-old burial chamber, and an iron age coastal fort perched at the end of the peninsula. The inland return leg takes you through wildlife-rich heathland that skirts the lower flanks of the jagged outcrop of Carn Llidi, before rejoining the coast path back to Whitesands Bay. If you’re keen to try a spot of off-road running then this is a very accessible circuit with enough punch to give your legs a bit of a test.Length: 11 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Market Cross, OsmotherleyClay Bank car park (OS Explorer OL26)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 2,460ft (750 metres)Terrain: Stone-paved moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Lordstones cafe at Carlton Bank (TS9 7JH)Following a segment of the 109-mile Cleveland Way national trail across the northern escarpment of the North York Moors national park, this is a strenuous route with some thigh-burning ascents and descents. But at the top of each steep climb you will be rewarded with outstanding views across the national park and beyond: north to the distant conurbation of Teesside and south and east across an expanse of moors and dales. The waymarked route heads north out of the pretty village of Osmotherley before entering a rollercoaster landscape that crosses five undulating moors: Scarth Wood Moor, Live Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank. Along the way, signs of the area’s industrial past are visible in the remains of alum, jet and ironstone mining the raw materials that were transported to Teesside during the Industrial Revolution. After a well-deserved break at Lordstones cafe, the route gets serious as it crosses the Three Sisters, a series of steep, rocky climbs with technical downhill sections including the impressive jagged sandstone crags known as the Wainstones, before a final steep descent brings you to Clay Bank. It’s not a route for the faint-hearted, but it certainly delivers when it comes to stunning moorland scenery. And the sense of achievement you feel at the end is most definitely worth it.Length: 7.3 milesTime: 2 hoursStartfinish: Heddon valley National Trust car park (OS Explorer OL9)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,270ft (387 metres)Terrain: Woodland track, exposed coast path and quiet roadRefuel: Hunters Inn, Heddon valley (EX31 4PY)The deep, wooded Heddon valley on the western flanks of Exmoor national park is a hidden gem for trail running, with its appealing mix of terrain, from gentle riverside paths and peaceful woodland tracks to rugged high sea cliffs and exposed moorland. And this circular route includes a healthy blend of them all. It begins in a tranquil woodland setting following an old smugglers’ path towards Heddon’s Mouth Cleave. But don’t be lulled into a false sense of “easiness” – the sting isn’t in the tail of this route, but a mere mile into the run when it climbs a steep zig-zag path to reach high sea cliffs with spectacular views across the Bristol channel to the south Wales coastline. You will need to keep your wits about you at this point as the route follows a narrow, exposed path that runs perilously close to the edge of the sheer cliffs rising more than 650ft (200 metres) above the sea below. It’s worth pausing along this coastal stretch to take in the rugged coastline, both ahead and behind you – if you’re lucky you may spot a kestrel hovering above the path or a peregrine falcon nesting in the cliff face. Veering off the coast path the route takes you across open moorland to reach its highest point at Holdstone Hill (1,145ft349 metres) before gently descending into dense oak woodland to follow Ladies’ Mile back to Hunters Inn, where you can reward yourself with a pint of local ale.Length: 10 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Cutthroat Bridge lay-by on the A57 (OS Explorer OL1)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,689ft (515 metres)Terrain: Moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Ladybower Inn (S33 0AX)The Peak District national park can certainly deliver the goods when it comes to a bracing off-road course with stupendous views. On this 10-mile circular route, prepare yourself for some hefty climbing during the first half as you ascend to Derwent Moor and journey along the ridge of Derwent Edge, but once past the trig point at Back Tor (1,765ft538 metres) the remainder of the route is much less demanding. Your first glimpse of Ladybower reservoir, a vast Y-shaped man-made reservoir, appears as you approach Whinstone Lee Tor, and as you continue northwards along Derwent Edge, passing a number of surreal eroded granite outcrops, the views of the Peak District landscape continue to impress: east across a vast stretch of exposed moorland and west along the lush Derwent valley towards the distinctive ridge of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill in the distance. The final segment is a gentle leg-stretcher along the eastern edge of the reservoir through Ladybower wood, passing through the lost village of Ashopton, which was flooded during the construction of the reservoir in 1940s. This isn’t a route for putting your head down and gunning for a personal best in fact, it’s worth easing off your pace so that you can fully enjoy the spectacular scenery.Unisex Colorado running packThis pack is ideal for long trail runs, with adjustable hip belt and chest straps.

But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her butterfly headdress by Philip Treacy for Valentino. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”• This article was amended on 9 May 2018 to clarify a credit.

The director’s newest film, Three Faces, has been included in the festival competition, with Cannes head Thierry Frémaux asking the French government for assistance in convincing Iran to allow Panahi to attend.Issuing a statement at the end of a press conference for his film Everybody Knows, which opened this year’s festival, Farhadi said that he had “difficulty living with” the fact that he was able to attend Cannes, while Panahi wasn’t. “I spoke to him yesterday,” Farhadi said. “I have great respect for his work and continue to hope he will be able to come. I would like to send out this message: I hope that the decision will be taken for him to be allowed to come. What’s important for him is not to be able to catch a flight, but for him to be able to see how spectators view his film. It’s not by reading the news that he’ll get this experience.”“It’s a very strange feeling for me to be able to be here whereas he cannot be here,” Farhadi added. “This is something I have difficulty living with. It’s wonderful that he’s continued his work in the face of such adversity.”Farhadi’s Everybody Knows stars Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem as former lovers who are drawn together when Cruz’s character’s daughter is kidnapped. During the press conference, Cruz revealed that she and Bardem, who are married, received equal pay for the film.In a quirk of timing, Everybody Knows premiered on the same day that Donald Trump announced that the US would withdraw from the international nuclear agreement with Iran. Farhadi said that he had received messages of support in the wake of Trump’s announcement. The director made headlines last year when he boycotted the Oscars in the wake of the travel ban issued by the Trump administration against some Muslim countries, which he described as “inhumane”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8f91d9ddf371d37130aa6e26ef6a580d7d26f67/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf4e16bd26b08a504d637079374e30b7","title":"mansfield 66 67 review jayne mansfield documentary","story":"This Jayne Mansfield documentary is bafflingly callous about her death in a car crash and focuses too much on her involvement with seedy self-publicist Anton LaVeyThis scrappy, shallow, incurious documentary about the final two years in the life of movie star Jayne Mansfield is disappointing, despite an interesting lineup of interviewees – including Tippi Hedren, John Waters, Mamie Van Doren, Kenneth Anger – and some academic figures promising perspectives from feminist and queer studies that don’t really materialise.I was hoping for an exuberant and clear-sighted reappraisal of Mansfield as an underappreciated entertainment star who was working within a very male Playboy-style idea of blond-bombshell sexiness. Instead, the film is bafflingly callous about her death in a car accident – and indeed the suffering of her young son, mauled by a lion at a private zoo – and weirdly obsessed with the tabloid headlines about Mansfield’s association with a very tiresome and seedy self-publicist called Howard Levey, who took the name “Anton LaVey” and styled himself America’s number one satanist. This ridiculous figure supposedly put a curse on Mansfield’s husband, to whom he had reportedly taken a jealous dislike, and it was this “curse” that was indirectly to take its fatal effect on Mansfield – according to the overworked occult myth that is part of the tongue-in-cheek Kenneth Anger legend. Her connection with the dodgy LaVey is vastly exaggerated by this film, and winds up making Mansfield subservient to a boring and untalented man. There are interesting moments: the clip of Mansfield almost sobbing about the suffering of troops when she returns from her USO trip to Vietnam is very striking. She was an intelligent woman with a flair for languages, but this film isn’t interested in trying to say anything all that original or insightful about her. Just yards and yards of stuff about “LaVey” and the satanist curse. A missed opportunity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64166e43220e39ddb229ae49adfaf8aff2b6c303/66_270_2338_1403/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=510864e595ea55fb65d1c3c7d4887bfa","title":"liverpool diogo leite porto","story":"Liverpool are leading the race to sign Porto’s Diogo Leite this summer.Porto are determined not to lose the 19-year-old centre-back, who is also a target for Arsenal and Manchester City, but Liverpool have been impressed with the youngster’s performances for the Portuguese side’s B team this season and have made their interest in him clear.Reports in Portugal have suggested that Arsenal are prepared to meet Leite’s €15m release clause this summer, but Anfield is his likeliest destination at the moment.

He battled back at Burton, where his influence was far greater than his few substitute appearancesAt the end of the season a 35-year-old Burton Albion defender who has made only one appearance this season and five last retired. Those bare facts suggest it is not a particularly notable event but that Shaun Barker was able to make the decision himself is a near miracle of persistence, mental strength and managerial faith.Barker’s right knee was obliterated in a freak collision when he was captaining Derby County against Nottingham Forest in 2012. As he told the  three years ago, the top and bottom halves of his leg were “pretty much held together by the skin alone”.After 39 months of painstaking rehab, Barker was released by Derby but was determined to play another game of professional first-team football, even if it was just a few minutes. The prospects looked grim: here was a 32-year-old defender who had not played for over three years and nobody knew whether he even could.That is, no one except perhaps Nigel Clough. This is the manager who signed Barker for Derby, probably would have signed him for Sheffield United and then not only did so for Burton but made him club captain, gave him two further six-month contracts and helped him achieve that goal of coming back. This is a relationship between a player and manager rooted in more than football’s tangibles.“Shaun’s influence goes beyond the pitch,” says Clough, explaining why he signed a player who he knew would probably not be able to play much. “If you can get him out there, brilliant but he’s about more than that – his influence around the club. It’s a strange one to explain. He’s a good captain to have around, a good person to have around. There’s not too many of them in football.”Yet Barker brought something beyond just being an elder sage, a dressing-room vibe man who can exert his ephemeral influence. His on-pitch contributions have been few but in Clough’s mind crucial: he has been used in a sort of “closer” role, brought on in tense situations when a calm demeanour and reliable header of the ball are required.“We knew that the odd time we’d be going into the last five minutes of the game,” Clough says, “hopefully holding a lead, and if someone is putting the ball into your penalty area, if there’s one person you want on for five minutes to head it away, it’s him.” Burton, relegated this season, stayed up by a single point last year and Clough points to a few games where, with Barker’s help, they held on: if his presence aided the collection of even one point, he made his contribution.Barker thinks Clough’s faith stems from 2010-11, their second season together at Derby. Barker needed an operation on his knee but told Clough that, if required, he would play until their status in the ision was confirmed. With barely any pre-season Barker travelled to the opening game at Leeds, came on at half-time and then played 42 of the next 43 games until survival was assured. He could barely train and was in pain for most of the season. “Those are the sort of things he won’t forget – he saw me doing what was right by him, and the club, even if it was detrimental to myself,” says Barker.The relationship works both ways, both men recognising what the other has given them. “There’s no doubt that I wouldn’t have played first-team football again if it wasn’t for him,” Barker says. “But I got that because he felt I deserved it, which I did.“People will say he’s looked after me, which I think is slightly wrong. I’d say he’s stood by me: if you say ‘looked after’, then you imply there’s nothing coming the other way, from me. He feels I’ve contributed more than just what I have on the pitch. I don’t know if another manager would have done that.”There is something else not often found in the game: from manager to player, almost a sense of duty, of common decency. “Signing him was a human decision to a degree,” Clough says, “because when someone smashes his knee up like that and puts his body on the line, I don’t think you should discard that player. You should do everything to support him.”“He’s always done the right thing by the people who’ve deserved it,” Barker says. “I know him deeper now than just a football manager. It’s a different relationship than just playing for him. It’s to be there if he needs anything from me, if that’s football-related or beyond that. We’re not best mates who will go for a drink together but we’ll always be close in a different way.”Barker would have liked to continue beyond this season: he was able to train and play it is how his knee recovered that caused the problem. He recently played an under-23s game and got through it fine but two days later he could barely walk.But he achieved his goal or at least the minimum end of his goal. Shortly after joining Burton in August 2016 he came on for the last few minutes against Derby, his old club. Relief passed over him. “It was a moment of contentment,” he said. Four more substitute appearances came that season but only one this, neatly enough against Derby again.“It’s been frustrating because I believed I would achieve more than I have done. You’re never really ‘ready’ to retire but I’m happy. It didn’t take me long to make the decision. I knew there was nothing more I could offer than I already had.“If I’d retired after leaving Derby, there would always have been that nagging feeling that I didn’t do what I said I was going to. As soon as I had that moment, I could finish content. To be able to say you’re retiring and looking forward to the next stage of your life, I’m very fortunate.”"},{"url":null,"title":"southampton twitter swansea hotel cancellation","story":"• Southampton endorse TripAdvisor review of hotel in Swansea• ‘Not planning to return any time soon’ included in mocking reviewSouthampton have poked fun at the hotel that cancelled their booking before their crucial game against Swansea City on Tuesday by endorsing a critical review of the venue on Twitter.The south coast club were bitterly upset after being prevented from staying at the Marriott Hotel in Swansea but they had the last laugh after Manolo Gabbiadini’s winner at the Liberty Stadium on Tuesday all but secured Southampton’s Premier League status and left Swansea City on the brink of relegation to the Championship.Having used the inconvenience as a motivational tool, Southampton can afford to look on the funny side now and they got their own back by tweeting a photo of a TripAdvisor review from a supporter who said they also had their booking cancelled by the Marriott. “Just some feedback” the club tweeted.The poster used Southampton’s crest as their profile picture and appeared to make references to Swansea’s heartbreaking defeat in a one-star review which has since been deleted by TripAdvisor.“Had been due to stay here for an extremely important business trip, only to have our reservation cancelled 24 hours before arrival, due to an apparent virus outbreak,” the poster, who used WeMarchOn as a pseudonym, said. “Very disappointing, as other guests’ bookings seemed to be unaffected – Fortunately the experience didn’t sour our trip. Business meeting was extremely productive! Not planning to return any time soon.”Mark Hughes said after the game that “dark arts” were at play, although the Southampton manager stressed that he apportioned no blame to Swansea for the cancellation. “I’m not for one minute suggesting Swansea had anything to do with that,” Hughes said. “It’s just maybe over-zealous Swansea fans in positions to affect our hotel booking. But those things you can use to your own benefit and use as a motivating factor.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d16399872ed21e11f036ab72bfba568c1f3dcc/128_176_1584_950/master/1584.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25a6788619da7f0ce088bb931f521474","title":"the joy of six football moves named after players","story":"From the Cruyff turn to early 20th century acrobatics, half a dozen stylistic flourishes named after their exponentsThe bulky 6ft 3in former Honduras striker (and one-time Birmingham City loanee) Carlo Costly is not an obvious skill merchant, but he carries in his locker one of the most delightful tricks in the modern game. It’s typically implemented when Costly is on the left side of the pitch with a defender alongside him on his inside. He will drop his pace to a jog and then languidly swing his left foot up and backwards in a fake backheel. At this point the defender invariably takes a step forwards, seeking to cut out the backheel, only for Costly to hit the gas and surge away. The trick is known as the costlyña in his homeland and, as video footage demonstrates, its capacity for rendering opposing defenders flatfooted is uncanny. Costly used his trick to memorable effect in a 2013 friendly against Ecuador in Houston. After cantering on to a pass down the inside-right channel, he dropped a costlyña to ease the defender Jorge Guagua out of his way before curling a magnificent shot into the top-left corner.On a tour of Central Europe in April 1901, Southampton’s Jack Robinson caused jaws to drop by keeping goal with an athleticism that none of the locals had ever witnessed. As an England international, Robinson’s fame preceded him and when Southampton arrived to play Slavia Prague, he was persuaded to give a display of his agility before kick-off. Robinson’s team-mates peppered his goal with shots and in the words of the club secretary, Ernest Arnfield, “scarcely a ball passed him”. Local supporters were used to seeing goalkeepers stretching and reaching, but Robinson threw his whole body into spectacular low saves that drew gasps from the crowd. When he had finished showing off his reflexes, spectators streamed on the pitch and chaired him off. Southampton played further games in Vienna and Budapest and finished their tour with a record of seven straight wins. By the time the squad left for home, Robinson had become a regional celebrity. Eye-catching saves were known as robinzonádas in Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary until well into the 20th century, and robinsonada remains in use today in Poland.Several countries equate ing headers with fish, the common denominator being horizontal, head-first movement, but in Brazil the gol de peixinho (“little fish goal”) owes its name to Peixinho, a former São Paulo winger who scored the first ever goal at Éstadio do Morumbi. Born Arnaldo Poffo Garcia, he was dubbed Peixinho (“Little Fish”) in honour of his father, Peixe (“Fish”), who had played for Santos in the 1940s. Peixinho was in the starting line-up when São Paulo played Sporting Lisbon in a friendly to inaugurate the Morumbi on 2 October 1960. In the 12th minute he made history by flinging himself at a right-wing cross from Jonas to head home the only goal. His name has become synonymous with flying headers in Brazil.During Mexico’s game against South Korea at the 1998 World Cup, Cuauhtémoc Blanco unveiled an innovation that instantly earned global acclaim. Twice during the second half in Lyon, Blanco collected possession wide on the left, allowed two defenders to close in on him and gripped the ball between his feet and leapt through the gap between his opponents. Mexicans came to know it as the cuauhtemiña (effectively, “little Cuauhtémoc move”). It was ungainly but effective and it brought a smile to the face – much like Blanco himself, who delighted in using his body in strange and unusual ways on the pitch. His other tricks included the jorobiña (“little hunchback flick”) and the nalguiña (“little arse flick”).Arguably the most influential figure in modern football history, Johan Cruyff gifted the game a move so simple and yet so devastating that it’s difficult to imagine the sport without it. Cruyff presented his turn to the world during a 0-0 draw against Sweden at the 1974 World Cup. Finding his route blocked by the Swedish right-back Jan Olsson, Cruyff made as if to play the ball infield, only to drag the ball behind his standing leg with his right foot and race off towards the byline. “That moment against Cruyff was the proudest moment of my career,” Olsson told David Winner in Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football. “I was not humiliated. I had no chance. Cruyff was a genius.”If it seemed inconceivable, however, that a trick so straightforward could never have been performed before, that’s because it was. Pelé was baffling defenders by flicking the ball behind his standing leg when Cruyff was still in short trousers and a British Movietone film from 1960 shows the Barcelona striker Eulogio Martínez pulling off a succession of textbook Cruyff turns during a European Cup match at Wolves. His widely accepted position as the inventor of the move owes much to the fact the 1974 World Cup was beamed into more homes than any tournament before. One ingenious piece of trickery turned the Irish winger Aiden McGeady into something of a global reference point. A well-watched YouTube clip shows him pulling off his trademark move during a game between Celtic and Aberdeen in October 2004. Having run on to a pass from John Hartson, McGeady finds himself facing the left-hand touchline with his back to the play. As Aberdeen’s Steve Tosh approaches from behind, McGeady performs a Cruyff turn directly into Tosh’s path, but then flicks the ball down the touchline with the outside of his left foot, leaving his opponent comically flatfooted as he scampers away. McGeady performed the trick so readily that it was soon included as a skill move in the Fifa game series, where it’s known as the McGeady spin.• This is an edited extract from Do You Speak Football?

By June, one of four reasonable heavyweights – Aston Villa, Derby, Fulham or Middlesbrough – will be back in the Premier League.Four legs and a final, at Wembley, will decide who that is but until then, let the brave, often defeatist, meaningless rogue predictions, mind games and number crunching commence. Now is the time to be choked by cliche how form is temporary, class is permanent and how head-to-head records and the state of the league table counts for nothing any more. Or does it?Fulham finished third after blowing the chance to gain passage to the Premier League at Cardiff City’s expense but have the chance to redeem themselves when they travel to Derby County on Friday evening before the second leg at Craven Cottage on Monday. They are yet to win a play-off game in six attempts, two of which came last season against Reading. In the past 15 years, the race to win automatic promotion has gone down to the final day on five occasions, with the loser reaching the top flight via the play-offs just once West Ham United, in 2012. Slavisa Jokanovic’s customary cool smacks of confidence, unsurprising given they were previously 23 games unbeaten, but in Derby, who finished sixth, they face a team that has reignited their own self-belief, trumpeting their own chances. “You can see they feel there is a little bit of extra zip, you can feel that bit of extra belief,” said Gary Rowett of his side. “We have almost been given a second chance and a side like that is going to be very dangerous.”Fulham looked stuck in the mud last time out, uncharacteristically sloppy compared with their usual vigour Ryan Sessegnon was shackled, Tom Cairney abnormally passive and Marcus Bettinelli, the goalkeeper, far too busy for Jokanovic’s liking. They are a wonderful team, but seem to struggle in one-off games, especially against more stubborn sides. Derby possess plenty of attacking threats, namely the Championship’s top scorer, Matej Vydra, but also that invaluable savvy streak and shed loads of experience.In the other semi-final, fourth-place Aston Villa and fifth-place Middlesbrough will do battle. There are a few neat subplots Albert Adomah and Adama Traoré facing their former clubs and Tony Pulis, the former West Bromwich Albion manager, renewing his rivalry with the claret and blue half of the West Midlands. Whether Traoré can shine against the club that brought him, from Barcelona B, to the country in 2015 will be particularly enticing. The speeding 22-year-old has lit up games that Middlesbrough have huffed and puffed their way through and, after the final game of the regular season, he had a clear message for fans. At full time at Portman Road, Traoré carried a black plastic blag towards a throng of young away supporters leant against the advertising hoardings, before handing out several shirts with his name and No 37 on the back, as well as the word “believe” underneath. Inspiring, yes, but Middlesbrough will need him and Patrick Bamford, another player rejuvenated under Pulis, firing if they are to overcome Villa.Steve Bruce’s side have been planning in earnest, with his assistant, Colin Calderwood, admitting their staff have prepared a “vault” of information centred on Middlesbrough. They rested a host of players in readiness for the play-off matches –Jack Grealish, John Terry, and Lewis Grabban were among those given a breather in the defeat at Millwall – with the manager conscious of his players “running out of gas” at the end of a long season. “We will have done our homework and we have experienced players, without a doubt,” said Villa’s Conor Hourihane. “The names speak for themselves. We’ll be ready and we are all looking forward to it. Ultimately, it is a game of football.”• The Football League play-offs get under way at the Valley on Thursday evening, when Charlton Athletic host Shrewsbury Town. Charlton won their last three matches to sneak into sixth while Paul Hurst’s side, who topped League One in November, have won just one of their past seven matches. “It’s a lot of effort these lads have put in to get ourselves in a position we could only have dreamed of at the beginning,” Hurst said.• A 22-man squad arrived in Myanmar on Tuesday afternoon for Leeds United’s heavily criticised post-season tour, given the UN have accused the country of ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya Muslim minority.

The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73fa60819029d7c237cba0e0dbc0147cb0e21244/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d25cd7970df732651b63085569313f5","title":"ice cream parlours booming instagram teetotalism","story":"Offering everything from liquid nitrogen-frozen creations to vegan sundaes, a new breed of dessert bars are changing the way people socialise – and dateBuilt in the Victorian era and now a sedate enclave of independent cafes and shops, Cardiff’s Castle Arcade does not look like a crucible of radical innovation. Enter Science Cream, however, and you step into a world of Heston Blumenthal-style theatre. Stood behind a Perspex screen, dressed in white lab coats and protective goggles, this ice-cream parlour’s “laboratrists” use great billowing flasks of liquid nitrogen to instantly freeze what is – thanks to LN2 creating such tiny ice-crystals – some of the smoothest, most thickly luxurious ice-cream you will ever taste.It is a spectacle at which, not just children, but even the most cynical adults cannot help but marvel. “Today, it’s all about doing what Amazon can’t and giving customers an experience,” says the owner, Carly Karran, who is hunting for a second site in Bristol. “We’re already nostalgic about ice-cream, it brings people joy, but throw in the liquid nitrogen vapour and it’s a double-whammy, a very Instagrammable one. It ticks all the boxes.”With its freshly blowtorched marshmallows, homemade honeycomb and use of all-natural ingredients (to ensure clear, intense flavours), Science Cream is a high-end parlour. Two scoops of its sea salt and burned caramel or black charcoal coconut ice-cream will cost you up to £5. But this hip store is also an example of a wider surge in the popularity of ice-cream parlours and dessert bars. A surge that, powered by fast-expanding national chains such as Kaspa’s and Creams, is bucking high street trends.If you are over 25, you may well never have heard of Creams, but this urban dessert bar chain (which serves hot pudding and waffles too, making it a go-to even in winter), has opened 70 sites in the past seven years and is aiming for 300 by 2022. A franchise operation, it is big enough that, until recently, it had former Nando’s regional director Handley Amos as its CEO, yet is relatively circumspect in its marketing. Aside from select associations with, for instance, Thorpe Park amusement park, it has grown (140,000 Facebook and 15,000 Instagram followers), largely via social media chatter.Last year, Creams made a subtle cameo (it’s “where you see a lot of dates take place,” explained Vice music site, Noisey), in the video for Big Shaq’s viral grime spoof, Man’s Not Hot. Evidence, says Creams co-founder Adam Mani, of its “cult following” among young people, particularly in London.From mainstream Creams to Ginger’s Comfort Emporium, a “grown-up” parlour in Manchester’s alternative Affleck’s Palace, social media is now a key driver in people’s ice-cream habits. Forget three-course meals, people want experiential moments in food. They want to eat colourful, out-there dishes that look great shared online. Ice-cream parlours, says PwC consumer expert Lisa Hooker, are perfect for “experience-seeking millennials” who crave innovative, affordable treats: “They have lots of products. It’s fun. There’s a lot going on.”“We’re plugged into that,” says Ginger’s owner, Claire Kelsey, whose £3.30-a-scoop flavours run from her legendary Chorlton Crack (salted caramel and peanut butter), to apple, mint and wheatgrass. Kelsey also makes several vegan ice-creams using oat milk and coconut oil. “We get loads of people coming in showing us their phones and saying, ‘Can I have that?’ We put weird flavours on our ice-cream van, and that’s what people want after seeing it on Twitter. There’s a lot of adventurous palates.”At the level of Science Cream and Ginger, margins are tight. They are producing small volumes and using expensive ingredients that need labour-intensive preparation and cooking. But mainstream dessert bars can be very lean, nimble businesses. At Creams, all its gelato (a lower-fat Italian version of ice-cream, made with more milk and less cream) is manufactured at a central production facility. Its cakes are bought-in. No chefs are needed. There’s no big kitchen investment. Throw in its counter-ordering and the fast turnover of customers and, even though the average spend at Creams is only £8 (two scoops of ice-cream for £3.95 most of its sundaes are £6–£8), it is a potentially lucrative business.“These dessert bar formats are absolutely outpacing the growth of normal restaurants,” says Joe Lutrario, deputy editor at Restaurant magazine. “Waffles, coffee, cake, ice-cream, it’s all serious money-making stuff and you only need a few staff to serve it. It’s a different, more profitable model and you can have an experience there for six quid, which is dramatically cheaper than somewhere like Nando’s.”Sat in Creams’ Stockport branch – a contemporary diner decorated with street art-bedecked skateboards, music pumping away in the background – it is easy to understand its appeal. It feels just cool enough to impress pickier teens without alienating anyone, including their parents. The unusually cheery staff make it welcoming, and my five-year-old is entranced by the gelato display.That product itself is Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s quality (a compliment!), and if a sample crepe feels a little sad and flabby, a cookie-dough crush sundae, topped with Mr Whippy-style ice-cream, caramel sauce and cookie dough crumb, is wolfed down. The kid’s blue bubblegum ice-cream is vile, obviously, but it does mimic that “screwball” flavour with eerie accuracy. None of this is cheap. Three of us are in and out in half-an-hour, £20 lighter. But the young couples in the neighbouring booths are in no hurry. You could stretch a tenner out here over an hour or so, which people seem to be doing more and more. For the ice-cream parlour’s rise is not solely a story about changing trends in ice-cream consumption (we are eating less ice-cream, but opting for better-quality options when we do indulge), but also a cultural shift in how we socialise.Founded in 2004 in Walthamstow, east London, Afters Original was one of the capital’s first dessert bar chains. It now has 10 sites. It opened, in no small part, to give young Muslims and families somewhere to hang out, locally. Its venues (garishly pink, US-inspired diners decorated with giant jukeboxes and even the occasional Chevrolet) are all alcohol-free, as is Creams, and open until late (1am in some cases), serving a global menu ranging from Mississippi mud pie to malai kulfi. “The Muslim community or people who don’t drink had limited places to go socially, and it can get boring going to the cinema every week,” says the owner, Kais Niaz. “This was kind of a replacement. Also, a lot of the old, traditional east London ice-cream parlours had closed. We created this buzz about dessert.”That buzz has now gained a national traction. Creams’ Adam Mani argues that a broad swathe of millennials, many non-drinkers or infrequent drinkers, are looking beyond the pub or coffee shop (“that’s an older generation”) for places to meet: “Youngsters don’t necessarily want to be in environments with alcohol, and families feel safer sending their kids to a place where they can have an ice-cream. We try to accommodate every ethnicity, dietary restriction and taste. I think that’s worked well in the sense that people’s social and cultural sensitivities are unconsciously accommodated.”Anecdotally, women are using dessert bars a lot, too both dry ones and those that serve booze. “It’s very female-led,” says Anthony Quinn, owner of Nottingham’s The Pudding Pantry. “Often, you look around and there’s not a single male. It’s an alternative to a bar. Come here and have a prosecco and some puddings.”All this sounds like a future-proofed demographic – young, multi-ethnic, female – that big corporations such as Unilever, owner of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Carte D’or, must be desperate to connect with. But Unilever shows little sign of entering this high-street parlour game. Its Ben \u0026amp Jerry “scoop shops” are almost entirely in cinemas. Such “dinosaurs” are poor, argues Mani, at adapting to youth trends: “London is a phenomenal melting pot of ideas and cultures and a lot of bureaucratic institutions don’t tap into that knowledge.”Could concerns about obesity and the growth of healthier diets be an existential threat to this boom? “I don’t feel threatened,” says Kelsey. “There’s so much noise around those issues, but most sensible people know you can’t live on ice-cream.”Niaz, whose Afters venues literally have their cake and eat it by also serving sorbets and healthier smoothies with names such as “flu-fighter”, sounds equally unconcerned: “It’s been designed as a treat, not an everyday meal. It’s not cheap-cheap. It’s a luxury.”In a global context, it is a luxury that still offers plenty to explore. A new development in London’s Chinatown, Central Cross, is home to several east-Asian dessert bar brands, such Guo C 100 and Roro, that serve durian milk puddings and Cantonese mango pancakes rarely seen in the UK. Someone from Creams, which already sells Hong Kong-style “bubble-pop” waffle cones, is probably there, right now, eating hard in the name of research. The future? It looks very sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf46f4f4310ad2771fd5e41f58d5b4fac40da6d4/0_477_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76b1eccc18a98e43d38582886031e05","title":"six of the best party snacks","story":"Elevate the nibbles for your next do by whipping up salt cod fritters, pork hand pies or shrimp and caper bunsFor the pastry175g butter, diced200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tsp grated parmesan1 egg yolk15ml ice-cold water1 tsp saltFor the fillingJuice of 1 lemon100ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 fennel bulb, finely diced 20g dill (or fennel top), chopped300g white crab meat150g brown crab meat10g parsley, chopped 1 pinch cayenne pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who co-chairs a pro-European Commons committee with Conservative Anna Soubry, said the leadership would now have to come off the fence and make it clear where it stood. “The time for constructive ambiguity is over: our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit,” he said.The vote came hours after Boris Johnson called the prime minister’s proposal for a customs partnership “crazy” in an interview with the Daily Mail that dealt a major blow to the government’s strategy of a cautious balance between leave and remain. Johnson was the subject of fierce criticism from within Tory ranks all day. In the Lords debate the former Tory MP Patrick Cormack asked: “What sort of example are we being given by a cabinet that is rent asunder by the foreign secretary, the second most important cabinet minister, rubbishing the prime minister in the columns of the Daily Mail?”On the key EEA amendment, Labour peers were whipped to abstain. But 83 defied the whip to back the amendment, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. Seventeen Conservatives also backed the amendment.It was the third defeat of the afternoon for the government and an unexpected triumph for a cross-party group that included Waheed Alli for Labour, the Conservative peer Sandip Verma and the crossbench peer Karan Bilimoria.All the amendments to the bill that have been passed in the Lords will have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. Lord Alli told the House that continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK’s export business and the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. “It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a £14bn trade surplus,” he said.“The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business.” In a rowdy and sometimes ill-tempered debate peers, many of whom had been debating the EU for the past 30 years, argued passionately for and against EEA membership.Officially Labour opposed the Alli amendment because other amendments gave MPs a role in the negotiations. But the leadership will now have to face the tension between its strongly pro-remain rank and file membership, its largely pro-remain MPs and the policy consequences of remaining in any arrangement with Europe such as the EEA, which limits its plans for greater state involvement in the economy.The Tories are now likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. The threat of higher EU migration is likely to alarm Labour voters in some parts of the country. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: “The referendum was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. Ongoing participation in the EEA would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety without having a say on how it is formulated – and it would also mean continued free movement. We will now consider the implications of this decision.”Peter Mandelson, the former trade secretary and one-time EU trade commissioner, said ministers were perpetrating a “Brexit fraud’ by pretending that migration from the EU, which would continue under membership of the EEA, would end after the UK left.“The time has come for economic reality and commonsense to prevail over wishful thinking and political dogma,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to do the right thing for the country and in my view that is what we have a duty to do.”The EEA offers most of the benefits of the single market, without being subject to the European court of justice. It does not cover the common agriculture or fisheries policies. Earlier, peers voted to remove the EU exit date of 29 March 2019 from the withdrawal bill, warning that it would be a straitjacket for negotiators. The Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, who moved the amendment, insisted he was not trying to undermine the result of the referendum by delaying or averting Brexit.“We should give ministers a bit more flexibility to secure and obtain ratification of the best possible deal, which will do the least damage to the economy and the national interest,” he said.The government also lost another vote on an amendment seeking to protect UK membership of EU agencies such as Euratom. The Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said it was an opportunity for the Commons to think again.“The House of Lords amendment is not about stopping Brexit but the fine print of when and how the agreements are concluded,” she said.The defeats came on the final day of debate on the report stage of the bill in the Lords. Peers are due to send it back to the Commons at the end of the week, and the government hopes it will be on the statute book before the end of May. The government has been forced to make concessions, as well as losing a dozen votes during the debates, in a series of amendments that have often had cross-party support.The amendments have been ided between trying to preserve benefits of EU membership, such as workers rights, and other fundamental rights through the incorporation of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, which has a broader reach than the UK Human Rights Act.Others were intended to promote the place of parliament at the heart of the process of leaving the EU, including clarifying the significance and consequences of the “meaningful vote” on any Brexit deal. And some were more narrowly technical, intended to restrict ministerial powers to change laws without proper parliamentary process and debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d90fbc0d6f4be81aaccb0e5ddbd81916b2de400/107_15_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e5ac7bfd61cc1e62dff8231fdca1c2b","title":"jeremy corbyn both of mays customs union plans are implausible","story":"Labour leader goes on attack over Brexit, highlighting Boris Johnson’s dismissal of PM’s preferred optionJeremy Corbyn has torn into Theresa May’s stalling on the EU customs union, suggesting during prime minister’s questions that cabinet ministers were deliberately undermining her preferred option.Corbyn said both of May’s options for a future customs arrangement with the EU were implausible, citing Boris Johnson’s Daily Mail interview where he called the partnership model “crazy”.He also quoted the former UK representative in Brussels Sir Ivan Rogers on the alternative model preferred by Brexiters for a technological solution for customs checks on the Northern Irish border, saying it was a “fantasy island unicorn model”.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations, security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays which will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as carmaking could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.“They have two options, neither of which are workable,” Corbyn said. The government, he said, had “wasted weeks working up proposals that the EU said was unworkable, that her own own foreign secretary described as crazy”.Corbyn said the prime minister had had “23 months to negotiate an agreement” with her cabinet but no progress had been made. “These negotiations are in a shambles. This house is being denied the opportunity to debate crucial legislation affecting the future of our economy and communities all over Britain.“When will we debate the trade bill and the customs bill? She’s had 23 months to get ready for it.”May said work was continuing on the future customs deal with the European Union. On Tuesday, Johnson launched an unprecedented attack on the customs partnership option, said to be May’s preferred solution, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.May said there would be a deal where the UK would “leave the customs union, we have an independent free trade policy, we maintain no hard border in Northern Ireland and we have as frictionless trade as possible”.“There were two options in my Mansion House speech. Questions have been raised about both of those options and further work continues. He has spent an entire career opposing a customs union. Now, when the British people want to come out, he wants to stay in. I know he’s leader of the opposition but that goes a bit far.”Corbyn said the case for a new customs union was backed by both the CBI and TUC, businesses and trade unions. May, he said, should stand up to hard Brexiters on her backbenches, quoting Conservative MP Ken Clarke who called them “wild rightwing people”.“Labour want to go into a customs union ... with Brussels negotiating trade deals in their interests, not our own. Typical Labour, letting Britain down once again,” May said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d83b0a406abd8e68bc768f2da89c5d1c448a1d/189_21_1350_810/master/1350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de3ec1962119ffe7713618e9d0ea668c","title":"theresa may became almost incoherent at times jeremy corbyn pmqs","story":"Reader reaction to some of the most talked about stories today, including your thoughts on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsPrime minister’s questions dominated reader discussion on site on Wednesday lunchtime.

Here are some of your thoughts:Much stronger performance from Corbyn today, thank goodness. He nailed May on isions in the government and she became almost incoherent at times. Enjoyed looking at the glum faces, particularly David Lidington and Philip Hammond when she was trying to answer on her preferred customs arrangement.DaivedoverGiven the few times May actually answers the questions at PMQs, is it worth ditching this last charade of democracy? Maybe we should just go straight to the flimsy dictatorship already largely in place through emergency legislation, inadequate debating time, and the insertion of last minute amendments so beloved of this bunch.olderiamthelessiknowCorbyn asks the right questions, but with May this is no more effective than putting a letter in a bottle and consigning it to the waves. Her sole tactic at PMQs is ersion by way of talking-points and rehearsed soundbites.MrdaydreamForeign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall writes that “Donald Trump’s torpedoing of the Iran nuclear deal on highly specious and misleading grounds is an act of wanton diplomatic vandalism fraught with dangers.” You’ve been sharing your thoughts beneath his piece.That said, I don’t agree that the UK should withdraw its invitation. I also don’t agree with the ongoing drive to isolate the United States. For the UK to withdraw the invitation would only further add to the growing US isolationism, at a time in the world’s history when nations should be working more closely together.His decision also, may it be said, could very well add to any scepticism already extant about any possibility of securing a lasting nuclear deal with North Korea.ID6732157Readers welcomed back George Monbiot after a period away from his column.I don’t always agree with you, George but thank you for writing this.

She was wandering around the ward a few days post-op when the docs were doing their ward round. She was called back to bed, and after the usual check, and chat to the medical students, she was asked if she had any questions. She said, in her prim and proper voice “When will I be able to start having intercourse again?”. I never did find out if she meant it or it was her wicked sense of humour, but the look on the doctors’ faces and the consultant delivering advice with a bright red face was a sight to behold.dunnock49Comments have been edited for length.

Now, they’ve revolutionised the processNaveed and Samiya Parvez built a business so that other families wouldn’t have to suffer what they did. The couple set up healthcare service Andiamo following the death of their nine-year-old son, Diamo. Diamo had cerebral palsy and relied on braces and splints, known as orthoses, to support and protect his body. The process of getting fitted for orthoses caused Diamo and his family so much distress that Naveed and Samiya became determined to find an alternative.The procedure for being measured for orthoses was a harrowing experience for Diamo. Naveed had to restrain him to keep him still while cold plaster was wrapped around him – a process that takes an hour. “He went blue in the face screaming when they did this to him. You’re pinning a child down who is non-communicative,” he says. “You’d be horrified doing that to an adult – doing that to a kid who has no idea what is happening to them is even worse.” It would then take three to six months for the orthoses to be created on the NHS, by which point Diamo would have grown, so the fit was rarely a good one. The family also tried private healthcare services, which could create the orthoses within six weeks, but used the same plaster cast process and so were just as unreliable in terms of fit. Private treatment was also prohibitively expensive, with one brace, which would be outgrown within nine months, costing around £5,000. He and Samiya consulted experts and researched 3D printing, scanning and materials science, and 12 months later created the first prototypes for orthoses. Their London-based business uses 3D scanning and printing to measure and produce orthoses for children and young adults who are unable to use their limbs, or can’t control their posture. “3D printing experts started coming to us and saying ‘We’ve never seen what you’ve done before,’” says Naveed. “We had Google ringing us up for advice. That’s when we realised that this tiny little team with this crazy idea had suddenly become a world leader by accident.”The measurement process involves moving a handheld 3D scanner over the body for about a minute. The scan is much more accurate than a plaster cast – and the whole process is even fun, according to Naveed: “Kids love it. Either they want to watch what’s going on, because it’s cool and interesting, or they’re watching a cartoon on their tablet while we quickly scan them, and they’re just completely oblivious.” The 3D-printed orthosis is lighter and less cumbersome than a traditional brace, is ready within a week, and costs approximately £1,500.Since Andiamo launched, other companies offering 3D-printed orthoses have emerged, such as Plus Medica, but Naveed says Andiamo is the only service of its type focused on paediatrics. “We designed the whole process around the family’s experience,” says Naveed.Naveed and Samiya, who currently have 30 patients and have delivered 160 orthoses to date, now plan to expand. “Our goal is to see at least another 100 new patients in the next 18 months,” says Naveed. Orthoses have broad applications across the medical world, such as in healing complex fractures, so Andiamo’s potential is huge. Naveed and Samiya hope to treat 15 million children over the next 10 years.“We couldn’t really think of a better way of remembering Diamo than being able to create a legacy that means that no other child or family has to go through what we did,” says Naveed. “That bloody-mindedness just pushed us through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6555b5ec10d71895ce8ab3bf5110caf27e4820e/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fab0391de9270c1b50f93f463ee4f3c","title":"how oregon grew too much marijuana to sell","story":"Oregon farmers have grown three times what their customers can smoke in a year, causing bud prices to plummet and panic to set inA recent Sunday afternoon at the Bridge City Collective cannabis shop in north Portland saw a steady flow of customers.Little wonder: a gram of weed was selling for less than the price of a glass of wine.The $4 and $5 grams enticed Scotty Saunders, a 24-year-old sporting a gray hoodie, to spend $88 picking out new products to try with a friend. “We’ve definitely seen a huge drop in prices,” he says.Across the wood and glass counter, Bridge City owner David Alport was less delighted. He says he’s never sold marijuana this cheap before.“We have standard grams on the shelf at $4,” Alport says. “Before, we didn’t see a gram below $8.”The scene at Bridge City Collective is playing out across the city and state. Three years into Oregon’s era of recreational cannabis, the state is inundated with legal weed.It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis – too good.In February, state officials announced that 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state’s database.If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that’s because it is: last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000lb of legal bud.That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer – without much regard to whether there’s demand to fill.The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.Wholesale sun-grown weed fell from $1,500 a pound last summer to as low as $700 by mid-October. On store shelves, that means the price of sun-grown flower has been sliced in half to those four-buck grams.For Oregon customers, this is a bonanza. A gram of the beloved Girl Scout Cookies strain now sells for little more than two boxes of actual Girl Scout cookies.But it has left growers and sellers with a high-cost product that’s a financial loser. And a new feeling has descended on the once-confident Oregon cannabis industry: panic.“The business has been up and down and up and down,” says Don Morse, who closed his Human Collective II dispensary in south-west Portland four months ago. “But in a lot of ways it has just been down and down for dispensaries.”This month, WW spoke to two dozen people across Oregon’s cannabis industry. They describe a bleak scene: small businesses laying off employees and shrinking operations. Farms shuttering. People losing their life’s savings are unable to declare bankruptcy because marijuana is still a federally scheduled narcotic.To be sure, every new market creates winners and losers. But the glut of legal weed places Oregon’s young industry in a precarious position, and could swiftly reshape it.Oregon’s wineries, breweries and distilleries have experienced some of the same kind of shakeout over time. But the timetable is faster with pot: for many businesses, it’s boom to bust within months.Mom-and-pop farms are accepting lowball offers to sell to out-of-state investors, and what was once a erse – and local – market is increasingly owned by a few big players. And frantic growers face an even greater temptation to illegally leak excess grass across state lines – and into the crosshairs of US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ justice department.“If somebody has got thousands of pounds that they can’t sell, they are desperate,” says Myron Chadowitz, who owns the Eugene farm Cannassentials. “Desperate people do desperate things.”In March, Robin Cordell posted a distress signal on Instagram.“The prices are so low,” she wrote, “and without hustling all day, hoping to find the odd shop with an empty jar, it doesn’t seem to move at any price.”Cordell has a rare level of visibility for a cannabis grower. Her Oregon City farm, Oregon Girl Gardens, received glowing profiles from Dope Magazine and Oregon Leaf. She has 12 years of experience in the medical marijuana system, a plot of family land in Clackamas county, and branding as one of the state’s leaders in organic and women-led cannabis horticulture.She fears she’ll be out of business by the end of the year.“The prices just never went back up,” she says.Cordell ran headlong into Oregon’s catastrophically bountiful cannabis crop.The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) handed out dozens of licenses to new farmers who planted their first crop last spring. Mild weather blessed the summer of 2017 and stretched generously into the fall. And growers going into their second summer season planted extra seeds to make up for flower lost to a 2016 storm, the last vestige of a brutal typhoon blown across the Pacific from Asia.“That storm naturally constrained the supply even though there were a lot of cultivators,” says Beau Whitney, senior economist for New Frontier Data, which studies the cannabis industry.It kept supply low and prices high in 2017 – even though the state was handing out licenses at an alarming rate.“It was a hot new market,” Whitney says. “There weren’t a whole lot of barriers to entry. The OLCC basically issued a license to anyone who qualified.”Chadowitz blames out-of-state money for flooding the Oregon system. In 2016, state lawmakers decided to lift a restriction that barred out-of-state investors from owning controlling shares of local farms and dispensaries.It was a controversial choice – one that many longtime growers still resent.“The root of the entire thing was allowance of outside money into Oregon,” Chadowitz says. “Anyone could get the money they needed. Unlimited money and unlimited licenses, you’re going to get unlimited flower and crash the market.”As of 1 April, Oregon had licensed 963 recreational cannabis grows, while another 910 awaited OLCC approval.That means oversupply is only going to increase as more farms start harvesting bud.The OLCC has said repeatedly that it has no authority to limit the number of licenses it grants to growers, wholesalers and dispensaries (although by contrast, the number of liquor stores in Oregon is strictly limited).Since voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, many industry veterans from the medical marijuana years have chafed at the entrance of new money, warning it would destroy a carefully crafted farm ecosystem.The OLCC remains committed to facilitating a free market for recreational marijuana in which anyone can try their hand at growing or selling.The demand for weed in Oregon is robust – the state reeled in $68m in cannabis sales taxes last year – but it can’t keep pace with supply.Whitney says it’s not unusual for a new industry to attract speculators and people without much business savvy.“Whenever you have these emerging markets, there’s going to be a lot of people entering the market looking for profit,” he says. “Once it becomes saturated, it becomes more competitive. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to cannabis. There used to be a lot of computer companies, but there’s not so many anymore.”Across rolling hills of Oregon farmland and in Portland dispensaries as sleek as designer eyewear shops, the story plays out the same: Business owners can’t make the low prices pencil out.Nick Duyck is a second-generation farmer and owner of 3D Blueberry Farms in Washington county. “I was born and raised on blueberries,” he says.But last June, Duyck launched Private Reserve Cannabis, a weed grow designed to create permanent jobs for seasonal workers.“By starting up the cannabis business,” says Duyck, “it keeps my guys busy on a year-round basis.”He invested $250,000 in the structural build-outs, lighting, environmental controls and other initial costs to achieve a 5,000 sq ft, Tier I, OLCC-approved indoor canopy.Ongoing labor and operational costs added another $20,000 a month.Weed prices were high: Duyck forecast a $1,500 return per pound. If Duyck could produce 20lb of flower a week, he’d make back his money and start banking profits in just three months.October’s bumper crop tore those plans apart.“We got in at the wrong time,” Duyck says. “The outdoor harvest flooded the market.”By the start of the new year, Duyck was sitting on 100lb of ready-to-sell flower – an inventory trickling out to dispensaries in single-pound increments.So he turned to a wholesaler, Cannabis Auctions LLC, which holds monthly fire sales in various undisclosed locations throughout Oregon.Weed auctions operate under a traditional model: sellers submit their wares, and buyers – dispensary owners, intake managers and extract manufacturers – are given an opportunity to inspect products before bidding on parcels awarded to the highest dollar.Duyck sent 60lb of pot to the auction block in December. He had adjusted his expectations downward: he hoped to see something in the ballpark of $400 a pound.It sold for $100 a pound.“The price per pound that it costs us to raise this product is significantly higher than the hundred dollars a pound,” says Duyck. (A little light math points to a $250-per-unit production cost.) “Currently, we’re operating at a $15,000-per-month loss,” Duyck says.If prices don’t improve soon, Duyck says he won’t be able to justify renewing his OLCC license for another year.“The dispensaries that are out there, a lot of them have their own farms, so they don’t buy a lot of product from small farms like us’” Duyck says. “If you really want to grow the product, you almost have to own the store also.”Middlemen – store owners without farms – are also suffering. Take Don Morse, who gave up selling weed on New Year’s Eve.Morse ran Human Collective II, one of the earliest recreational shops in the city, which first opened as a medical marijuana supplier in 2010. At times, Morse stocked 100 strains in his Multnomah Village location.Morse lobbied for legal recreational weed and founded the Oregon Cannabis Business Council.The shift to recreational was costly. With his business partner Sarah Bennett, Morse says he invested more than $100,000 in equipment to meet state regulations.By last summer, new stores were popping up at a rapid pace. Morse’s company wasn’t vertically integrated, which means it did not grow any of its own pot or run a wholesaler that might have subsidized low sales.“Competition around us was fierce, and the company started losing money, and it wasn’t worth it anymore,” Morse says. “At our peak, we had 20 employees. When we closed, we had six.”Morse couldn’t see a way to make the numbers work. Human Collective priced grams as low as $6 to compete with large chains like Nectar and Chalice, but it struggled to turn a profit.“When you’re the little guy buying the product from wholesalers, you can’t afford to compete,” he says. “There’s only so far you can lower the price. There’s too much of everything and too many people in the industry.”So Morse closed his shop: “We paid our creditors and that was that. That was the end of it.”Despite losing his business, Morse stands behind Oregon’s light touch when it comes to regulating the industry.“It’s just commercialism at its finest,” he says. “Let the best survive. That’s just the way it goes in capitalism. That’s just the way it goes.”Just as mom-and-pop grocery stores gave way to big chains, people like Morse are losing out to bigger operations.Chalice Farms has five stores in the Portland area and is opening a sixth in Happy Valley. La Mota has 15 dispensaries. Nectar has 11 storefronts in Oregon, with four more slated to open soon.Despite the record-low prices in the cannabis industry, these chains are hiring and opening new locations, sometimes after buying failed mom-and-pop shops.The home page on Nectar’s website prominently declares: “Now buying dispensaries! Please contact us if you are a dispensary owner interested in selling your business.”Nectar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Because the federal government does not recognize legal marijuana, the industry cannot access traditional banking systems or even federal courts. That means business owners can’t declare bankruptcy to dissolve a failed dispensary or farm, leaving them with few options. They can try to liquidate their assets, destroy the product they have on hand and eat the losses.Or they can sell the business to a company like Nectar, often for a fraction of what they’ve invested.Deep-pocketed companies can survive the crash and wait for the market to contract again.Oregon faces another consequence of pot businesses closing up shop: leftover weed could end up on the black market.Already, Oregon has a thriving illegal market shipping to other states.US attorney for Oregon, Billy Williams, has said he has little interest in cracking down on legal marijuana businesses, but will prosecute those shipping marijuana to other states.“That kind of thing is what’s going to shut down our industry,” Chadowitz says. “Anything we can do to prevent Jeff Sessions from being right, we have to do.”Ask someone in the cannabis industry what to do about Oregon’s weed surplus, and you’re likely to get one of three answers.The first is to cap the number of licenses awarded by the OLCC. The second is to reduce the canopy size allotted to each license – Massachusetts is trying that. And the last, equally common answer is to simply do nothing. Let the market sort itself out.Farmers, such as Walker of East Fork Cultivars, argue that limiting the number of licensed farms in Oregon would stunt the state’s ability to compete on the national stage in the years ahead.“We’re in this sort of painful moment right now,” says Walker, “but I think if we let it be a painful moment, and not try to cover it up, we’re going to be better off for it.”Walker and other growers hope selling across state lines will someday become legal.Every farmer, wholesaler, dispensary owner and economist WW talked to for this story said that if interstate weed sales became legal, Oregon’s oversupply problem would go away.Under the current presidential administration, that might seem a long shot. But legalization is sweeping the country, Donald Trump is signaling a looser approach, and experts say Oregon will benefit when the feds stop fighting.“The thing about Oregon is that it is known for its cannabis, in a similar way to Oregon pinot noir,” Whitney says. “For those who are able to survive, they are positioned extremely well not only to survive in the Oregon market but also to take advantage of a larger market – assuming things open up on a federal level.”Looking for more great work from the Portland, Oregon, alt-weekly paper and website Willamette Week?

The Boring Company now wants to build a longer “proof of process” tunnel 2.7 miles beneath LA. This could form the backbone of a larger transportation network across the city, called Loop, with electric “skates” whisking people, bikes and cars from station to station at speeds of up to 150mph.The only problem is, Musk’s own Tesla probably won’t be able to fit in it. A 1,600-page document filed with LA city officials specifies the dimensions of the tunnels and the vehicles they could accommodate – and that doesn’t include the Tesla Model S or Model X. A table detailing the operational assumptions of Loop says “D segment car is largest size”. D-segment cars, the European equivalent to an American mid-size, are typically 73in wide. The Model S measures more than 77in and the Model X is wider still. Even the original Tesla Roadster is too broad. Only the Model 3 will likely be able to squeeze underground.The Boring Company told the  that the initial focus of Loop will be transporting people and bicycles, but admitted that there would be a limit on which passenger cars could travel on future versions. A key part of Musk’s plan for his subterranean network is that its tunnels will be much smaller than normal road tunnels, and thus cheaper, easier and quicker to build. “The current standard for a one-lane tunnel is approximately 28ft,” reads the Boring Company’s FAQ. “By placing vehicles on a stabilized electric skate, the diameter can be reduced to less than 14ft. Reducing the diameter in half reduces tunneling costs by 3-4 times.”While the Boring Company awaits permission to start digging its “proof of process” tunnel, it continues to work on the tunnel at the SpaceX campus in Hawthorne. Pictures and videos on its website show a partly constructed tunnel with a large ventilation duct. This tunnel has been inspected at least twice for occupational health and safety, during which it received eight violations and a total of $1,810 in penalties for minor infractions involving walkways, cranes and railings. The company says that none of the violations occurred inside the tunnel itself.Despite its modest achievements to date, the Boring Company is pushing on with more ambitious plans. It is working to get permissions to start digging two tunnels beneath the Baltimore-Washington Parkway to connect the cities, and it has been shortlisted to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a new express link between O’Hare airport and downtown Chicago. That might be later than the famously impatient Musk wants, but could be much sooner than is needed. In April, the mayor of Culver City, where the proof of process tunnel would end up, wrote a letter to his counterpart in Los Angeles. It complained that the project was not clearly defined, used the wrong checklists, and contravened the California Environment Quality Act on several points. It seems like the Boring Company may be doing something even more boring than boring in the months and years ahead – digging its way through a mountain of laws and regulations.

They are intended to provide a guiding light for tech companies keen on self-regulation, akin to similar sets of principles established by other industries – most famously the Asilomar principles, drawn up in 1975 to regulate genetic engineering.The principles are made up of three key recommendations: Numbers, Notice, and Appeal. “Companies should publish the numbers of posts removed and accounts permanently or temporarily suspended due to violations of their content guidelines,” the first principle advises.Currently, only YouTube provides such a report, of the major content sites, and in less detail than the principle recommends: it calls for information including the number of posts and accounts flagged and suspended, broken down by category of rule violated, format of content, and locations, among other things. YouTube’s content moderation transparency report revealed the company removed 8.3m videos in the first quarter of 2018.The second principle, Notice, recommends that “companies should provide notice to each user whose content is taken down or account is suspended about the reason for the removal or suspension.“In general, companies should provide detailed guidance to the community about what content is prohibited, including examples of permissible and impermissible content and the guidelines used by reviewers.” Many companies keep such detailed guidelines secret, arguing that explaining the law lets users find loopholes they can abuse.In 2017, the  published Facebook’s community moderation guidelines, revealing some examples of how the company draws the line on sex, violence and hate speech. Last month, almost a year later, Facebook finally decided to publish the documents itself. Mark Zuckerberg said the publication was a step towards his goal “to develop a more democratic and independent system for determining Facebook’s community standards”.Finally, the principles call for a right to appeal. “Companies should provide a meaningful opportunity for timely appeal of any content removal or account suspension.” Most companies allow for some sort of appeal, in principle, although many users report little success in overturning incorrect decisions in practice. Instead, observers have noted that the press has increasingly become an independent ombudsman for large content companies, with many of the most flagrant mistakes only being overturned when journalists highlight them. Twitter, for example, “is slow or unresponsive to harassment reports until they’re picked up by the media,” according to Buzzfeed writer Charlie Warzel.Facebook’s Zuckerberg has said he wants a more explicit appeals process. “Over the long term, what I’d really like to get to is an independent appeal,” he said, in an interview with Vox. “So maybe folks at Facebook make the first decision based on the community standards that are outlined, and then people can get a second opinion. “You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a supreme court, that is made up of independent folks who don’t work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.”Neither Facebook, Google nor Twitter commented for this article."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893041489eefcfccf7d927339d5db05b58ba3647/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05387a7d622ae687592c7590c1c14a87","title":"harlem renaissance new york art food history","story":"The Harlem EatUp! food festival starts on 14 May – just one opportunity residents and enthusiastic newcomers have to celebrate and develop the culture of this historic New York districtIt was after midnight on a Wednesday and Paris Blues, Harlem’s oldest surviving jazz bar, was standing-room only. The e has remained, stubbornly, much the way it has since it opened in 1969. There’s neither a cover charge nor fancy cocktails and patrons can help themselves to barbecued chicken and other comfort food for free. In the corner, Samuel Hargress Jr, the 81-year-old owner who lives on the premises, was holding court in a fedora and tweed jacket.“I’m old-old-school. Things are real different now to when I came along,” he said. Since purchasing the bar for $35,000, Hargress has been a central figure in one of New York’s most historic – and rapidly changing – neighbourhoods. Though his establishment maintains a local following, these days it’s famous enough to attract international visitors. “You’ve got people from all over. Everybody here’s partying and dancing. They don’t know each other but it don’t matter.”Harlem’s history has long been marked by waves of new arrivals and change. Over the years, it has been home to everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Duke Ellington. Before it became a haven for African-American intellectuals, poets and musicians during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 30s it was a stronghold of Jewish luminaries, many of whom were displaced by rapid development on the Lower East Side. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 80s, the neighbourhood is once again a hotbed of cultural activity.“It’s an evolving community. I’ve been here since 1980 and it didn’t just change overnight,” says John Reddick. A Harlem historian and preservationist, Reddick leads neighbourhood walking tours.“A lot of tourists have all this baggage and it takes a certain willingness to get beyond that. They think I’m just showing them the nicer side of Harlem, even though these buildings have been here for more than 100 years. I get this all the time: ‘Where in Harlem should you not go?’ There’s nowhere in Harlem I would not go.”Reddick urges visitors and newcomers to make a more meaningful connection with the existing community, whether by visiting a local church or enjoying the free art and live performances at Marcus Garvey park, St Nicholas park and Jackie Robinson recreation centre. Above all, he hopes that everyone who comes gains an appreciation for the neighbourhood’s near-mythic quality and what that has meant for different generations.“Look out of your window and it’s like this Fred Astaire-and-Ginger-Rogers view,” he says. “There’s this exhilaration of being in Harlem this sense that you’re part of this great metropolis. I feel it now, so you can imagine what it must have been like in the 1920s or 30s for somebody such as the poet Langston Hughes.”While there is much that Hughes would still recognise, it is impossible to ignore some of the changes. As with almost any neighbourhood in Manhattan, particularly one marked by handsome, turn-of-the-century brownstones and broad boulevards, Harlem’s property values have skyrocketed, causing residents to question what the future holds. A recent attempt by developers to rebrand the desirable area between 110th Street and 125th Street as SoHa resulted in a backlash by activists. Yet despite the Whole Foods on 125th Street and the queasy spectacle of a townhouse going for more than $4m, Harlem and its cultural institutions have managed to hold on to a distinct identity.“Harlem, throughout all the waves of gentrification and forced migration, has maintained a sense of itself,” says Nico Wheadon, director of public programmes and community engagement at the Studio Museum on 125th Street, which showcases work by African-American artists. “That’s because in its essence, it is an artistic, creative place. There is a history of struggle and protest to maintain that.” As with the National Black Theatre, another important Harlem institution, the Studio Museum turns 50 this year.Some of the efforts to maintain a sense of community have been quieter endeavours such as The Laundromat Project, which provides support for local artists and hosts programmes in laundromats and other public spaces. Another small startup is Hot Bread Kitchen, a non-profit project based in La Marqueta in East Harlem that provides female immigrants facing economic insecurity with a living wage, job training, and support.Meanwhile, the Studio Museum is in the process of redefining itself, moving beyond the walls and connecting with the broader public through art installations in parks and libraries, creative workshops talks, and even dance parties, such as its popular summer series, Uptown Fridays! Though the museum has shut its doors (there are plans to demolish the existing property and rebuild on the same site) it remains an active part of the community, including as its links with El Museo del Barrio, a Spanish Harlem art showcase.As with many Harlem residents, Wheadon finds the neighbourhood fulfils most of her social and entertainment needs. For an evening out, she heads to Vinatería, a stylish Mediterranean spot or 67 Orange Street for cocktails. She’s equally in love with the classics, from the amateur nights at the Apollo Theater to live music at Showman’s Jazz Club (375 West 125th Street), which she says feels “like the Harlem that I imagined before I moved here. It’s a time warp.”Change has, in part, been driven by Harlem’s thriving culinary scene. At its forefront is Marcus Samuelsson, the celebrity chef behind the Red Rooster restaurant, its subterranean sister venue, Ginny’s Supper Club and the Streetbird Rotisserie. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, Samuelsson spent eight years learning about the neighbourhood prior to opening Red Rooster, attending church events, eating at places such as Silvia’s – a soul-food staple opened in 1962 – and listening to residents.“When you think about the Studio Museum or the National Black Theatre, you’re thinking about this incredible depth of art, of music. We want this to be a destination for food as well,” Samuelsson says. “For me it was about working where you live and creating jobs to restore your community.”Samuelsson’s talk of community is more than lip-service. He works closely with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a programme that helps disadvantaged teens enter the restaurant industry and is an integral part of Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival that highlights both established chefs and small-time food entrepreneurs. Samuelsson respects the older establishments, though he does not view the broader range of options as inherently negative.“You have ramen restaurants now, you have mixologist bars, you have craft coffee and I think that’s great. A community should be able to have both. You want it to be a place where people who live there don’t have to leave to go to a great place,” he says.Likewise, Wheadon feels optimistic that the neighbourhood will continue to hold onto that in the future.“Someone asked me the other day: ‘What is blackness to you?’ I said: ‘It’s celebration.’ I can’t walk to or from work without being swept up in somebody’s something,” she says. “There’s something beautiful about that and I think that Harlem will always have an element of that.”At Paris Blues the scene was certainly one of celebration. As the night wore on, musicians from nearby bars stopped by to jam with the band. Although Hargress is constantly approached with offers from developers, he has no intention of retiring or selling the joint.“I have fun with them. One guy offered me $6m,” he said, adding with unrestrained glee, “So I told him, you come up with $10m, then maybe you can call me back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4785b02799235f69531249977ba6b8a00954f90/0_147_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76988f3b78ac7450d56858c5f7a5027d","title":"michael cohen russia stormy daniels lawyer claim","story":"Michael Avenatti makes extraordinary allegation that Cohen received cash from company affiliated with billionaire linked to Vladimir PutinDonald Trump’s attorney and legal fixer, Michael Cohen, was paid half a million dollars by a company affiliated with a Russian oligarch closely linked to Vladimir Putin, according to extraordinary allegations published on Tuesday.Cohen was said by Avenatti to have received $500,000 through a US affiliate of the Renova investment group owned by Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire closely associated with Putin who was placed under sanction by the US government last month. The payments were allegedly made between January and August 2017.An attorney for the Renova affiliate, Columbus Nova, said it hired Cohen as a business consultant and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments. Cohen, his attorney, and the Republican National Committee – for which Cohen is a deputy finance chairman – did not respond to requests for comment.Avenatti’s document said the money was paid to Essential Consultants, the same company Cohen used to pay a $130,000 settlement to buy Clifford’s silence in October 2016. The document said Essential also received funds from other major companies, some of which had business before the federal government. AT\u0026ampT, the telecoms corporation, confirmed it had made payments to Cohen’s firm during 2017 for “insights into understanding the new administration”. Novartis, a Swiss-based pharmaceuticals firm, did not dispute that it paid Cohen. Vekselberg has reportedly been interviewed by investigators working for Robert Mueller, the special counsel looking into alleged collusion between Russia and Trump’s team during the 2016 election campaign. Vekselberg has not been accused of any wrongdoing. CNN subsequently reported on Tuesday that he was specifically asked by Mueller’s investigators about the alleged payments to Cohen.The 61-year-old oligarch amassed a fortune through his Renova conglomerate, which s energy, heavy industry and finance, probably making him Russia’s ninth-richest person. He has remained in the Kremlin’s favour and was last year given a state honour by Putin.Vekselberg was also a guest at a now notorious December 2015 dinner in Moscow celebrating the RT television channel, which was attended by Putin and Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser.Columbus Nova is described on its website as “the US investment vehicle for the Renova Group”. The company’s chief executive, Andrew Intrater, contributed $250,000 to Trump’s presidential inauguration fund in January last year and a further $35,000 to Trump’s re-election fund in June last year.It was not clear from Avenatti’s document whether these contributions were connected to the new allegations. Intrater did not respond to an email asking whether the allegations were accurate.An attorney for Columbus Nova, Richard Owens, said in an email that the company was owned by Americans and that Vekselberg had no involvement in the payments to Cohen. “After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,” said Owens. Avenatti asserted that Cohen also collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from corporate clients. AT\u0026ampT was said to have paid Cohen’s firm $200,000 in four monthly installments from October 2017. Trump’s administration was at the time considering whether to allow an $85bn merger of AT\u0026ampT and Time Warner, which it has since rejected. In an emailed statement, AT\u0026ampT said: “Essential Consultants was one of several firms we engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration. They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017.”Avenatti said that a subsidiary of Novartis paid Cohen’s company almost $400,000 “in late 2017 and early 2018”. Novartis’s incoming chief executive, Vas Narasimhan, was one of several businesspeople invited to dinner with Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on 25 January.A spokesman for Novartis said in an email: “Any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have expired.”Avenatti has become one of the most publicly visible foes of Trump and Cohen since being recruited to represent Clifford in the fallout of the payoff and secrecy agreement arranged by Cohen being publicly revealed. Clifford has filed civil lawsuits against Trump and Cohen.Avenatti told the  last weekend, without offering any new evidence, that he believed Trump would have to resign from the presidency: “I firmly believe there is going to be too much evidence of wrongdoing by him and those around him for him to be able to survive the balance of his term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

Two shops were damaged by the blast.“There was a loud roar and everyone started to flee like crazy when they didn’t understand what was happening,” reported Il Messaggero, whose head office is on Via Tritone. “We thought it was a bomb,” Japanese tourists told the newspaper.The explosions are so frequent in Rome that residents have suggested public transport poses a greater threat to their safety than terrorism. There were 22 bus blasts last year and 14 in 2016, with no reported injuries. The interior minister, Marco Minniti, visited the scene of the blast with Linda Meleo, the city’s transport official. Meleo said 200 new buses had been put in circulation since the Virginia Raggi, of the Five Star Movement, was elected mayor in June 2016.Raggi has admitted, however, that a large proportion of the fleet is “too old”. “Investigations are under way to establish the cause.

He said: “He both threatened the system as well as the nation ... The body of this man, Trump, will turn to ashes and become the food of the worms and ants, while the Islamic Republic continues to stand.”Hardliners in Iran have been given a new lease of political life with Trump’s decision to torpedo the agreement and reimpose economic sanctions at the highest level, seizing on an opportunity to consolidate their power over reformists who championed the pact. On Wednesday the commander of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards congratulated the nation on the US exit. Mohammad Ali Jafari said: “I congratulate and see as a good deed the vicious withdrawal of the US from JCPOA, which was not credible even before the withdrawal … It was proved once more that US isn’t trustworthy in regards its commitments.”At the opening session of the Iranian parliament, a group of hardline MPs held up a paper US flag and the text of the JCPOA before setting fire to both and chanting “death to America”.The MPs’ protest was a nod to Khamenei, who had said in June 2016, prior to Trump’s election, that if the Americans “tear it up, we will set it on fire”.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.Khamenei said on Wednesday it was not feasible for Iran to continue implementing the agreement without making sure that the European partners in the agreement, the UK, France and Germany, could withstand US pressure. The EU wants to keep the agreement but a US exit might trigger a collapse of the deal because US sanctions will hamper European business with Tehran. Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament, said Tehran would wait to gauge how the European partners in the nuclear talks would handle the US exit from the deal. His comments echoed those of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who has said the agreement could survive if Europe defies Trump.The US exit from the agreement dominated Wednesday’s newspaper front pages in Tehran. “Barjam minus America,” read the main headline on the front page of the reformist Ebtekar daily. “US exit from Barjam puts an end to the world’s trust in the empire of lies,” Ettela’at’s front page said. “Trump tore up the agreement, now it’s time for us to set it on fire,” read the front page headline of Kayhan, an ultra-conservative daily whose editor is appointed directly by Khamenei. Despite Rouhani’s assurances that Iran is prepared to withstand the impact of a US exit, Trump’s decision has revived worries of conflict inside Iran, where people are concerned about the state of its already fragile economy, and consequences for the fate of reformists.On Tuesday night ordinary Iranians were on tenterhooks, monitoring any immediate impact on the country’s national currency, and prompting panic-buying of hard-to-find dollars amid political uncertainty. The rial traded at the all-time low on Wednesday. One US dollar was exchanged for 75,000 rials. Sadegh Zibakalam, a prominent political commentator and professor of politics at Tehran University, struck a pessimistic tone about the consequences of Trump’s decision.“Many people are worried about war,” he told the  by phone from Tehran. “Whenever the country faces a crisis in its foreign policy or economy, the situation gets better for hardliners, they’d be able to exert their force more easily.” Foad Izadi, a Tehran-based conservative political analyst, said Trump’s aim was to confront Iran with greater force but that it could withstand the pressure. “For 40 years, we have been living under sanctions. The collapse of the nuclear deal will mean that we have to find ways to circumvent sanctions, something we have done in the past,” he said.For ordinary Iranians, however, the prospects are gloomy. One, Arash Tavanafar, said the psychological pressure of Trump’s decision on the Iranian population could prove more powerful than its economic effect. “The psychological pressure and worry is destroying us, especially the youth, because we neither have any trust in this political system, nor any hope for its reform. We’ve only become spectators of its downfall,” he said. It’s hard to overstate the power of Telegram in Iran. Of its 80m population, an estimated 40m use the free app created by Russian national Pavel Durov. Its clients share videos and photos, subscribing to groups where everyone from politicians to poets broadcast to fellow users.While authorities ban social media websites like Facebook and Twitter and censor others, Telegram users can say nearly anything. In the last presidential election, the app played a big role in motivating turnout and spreading political screeds.Telegram touts itself as being highly encrypted and allows users to set their messages to “self-destruct” after a certain period, making it a favourite among activists and others concerned about their privacy. That too has made it a worry of Iranian authorities.A channel run by an exiled journalist, Roohallah Zam, helped organise some of those who took to the street, including times and locations for protests, and was suspended by Durov after Iranian authorities complained that it was inciting violence.Zam, who denies the allegations, responded by launching new channels to spread messages about upcoming protests before the government ordered the app shut down.\u0026nbspMohammad, a postdoctoral student, said Trump’s decision would undermine moderates in Iran as the country might have to name a new supreme leader in the coming years. Khamenei is 78, and there has been speculation over his health. “Moderates can play a significant role in the appointment of the new leader if they’re not weakened, something that can hugely affect the future generations in the country,” Mohammad said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a29d6e8f7421dab51ef9ad6aba7fa6e602e37257/0_29_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=177c4ae3c17018980111b20218dc899a","title":"russia shows off new missiles and jets in victory day parade red square","story":"Israeli PM among guests at Red Square parade marking second world war anniversaryRussia has showcased some of its most advanced weaponry, including nuclear missiles, during a military parade on Red Square in honour of the 1945 victory over Nazi Germany.“Peace is very fragile,” Vladimir Putin said at the start of the annual parade, which also featured a flypast by Russia’s new SU-57 stealth fighter, recently deployed to Syria.Around 27 million Soviet soldiers and citizens died in the second world war, and the annual Victory Day event is one of the country’s biggest public holidays. In recent years, critics have accused the Kremlin of using the holiday to push an aggressive form of nationalism.Other military hardware on show included Russia’s new hypersonic missile, known as the Kinzhal, which Putin recently described as “invincible”, and the YARS ballistic missile, which can carry 10 nuclear warheads over a range of up to 7,500 miles. Russia also showed off its Uran-9 remote-controlled light tank and advanced S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems.Among the few foreign guests at the parade was the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to hold talks with Putin on military coordination after airstrikes in Syria overnight that were blamed on Israel.Nine people were killed when missiles hit depots and rocket launchers that probably belonged to Iran’s Revolutionary Guards in Kisweh, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Netanyahu said before his trip to Moscow: “In light of what is currently happening in Syria, it is necessary to ensure continued coordination” between the Russian and Syria militaries. He made no mention of the overnight strikes.Tensions between Israel and Iran are high as Tehran attempts to expand its military operations in Syria, where it supports President Bashar al-Assad. Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that the US would break the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran has triggered uncertainty and threatened to spark more unrest in the Middle East.Russia has promised to supply Syria with air defence systems, most likely S-300 surface-to-air missiles.Israel has carried out dozens of bombing raids against Syrian targets since the civil war began in 2011, and has pledged to target Russian-supplied anti-aircraft systems if they are deployed against Israeli jets. “If someone fires on our planes, we will destroy them,” Israel’s defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, said last month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf0494d0272fef2a74cf52e91f5cbf24471deb74/0_89_4480_2687/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d55b29567124eea63bb00e06fcb782e0","title":"settlement in abdul hakim belhaj rendition case to be announced","story":"Dissident who was kidnapped and sent to Libyan prison had insisted upon an apologyA legal settlement in the long-running rendition case involving the Libyan dissident Abdul-Hakim Belhaj is expected to be announced in parliament on Thursday.Belhaj and his wife, Fatima Boudchar, were kidnapped in Bangkok in 2004 after cooperation between the CIA and MI6.

If granted permission it would be the first apartment scheme in Kilternan.The design of the complex “seeks to delve into a portion of the nation’s richest historical architectural heritage” the application states, and is based on the Custom House and the “Georgian Squares of Dublin” according to the developers. It also represents a “back to basics” approach in terms of design, Calerotech said.Local resident Anne-Marie Leen described the scheme as a “monstrosity of a development” which is “totally unsuitable to the areas and is only at best suitable for a city centre location, and probably not suitable in Ireland at all”.The apartments would not be in keeping with the “countrysidevillage feel” of Kilternan, she said.Another local, Ciarán Moulton, said the scheme would “adversely effect the views to the Dublin mountains enjoyed by local residents”, would worsen local traffic, and affect visibility on the main road.The Balally Residents Association said the height and scale of the development was “more aligned to a city – not a rural suburb”. It would increase the already “massive traffic delays” and the pressure on the Luas Green line, it said.Several residents emphasised the low-rise nature of the area, which is dominated by bungalows and two-storey houses, and said the additional traffic would damage air quality and affect the health of existing residents.In relation to the scale, Calerotech said when Dublin’s Georgian squares were first planned they were considered “too urban” for their locations, and that 60 years ago “ Cabra, Crumlin, Ballymun etc” were mostly green fields.Local Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy made a submission in favour of the scheme which he said appeared a more “family friendly” size than most apartment schemes in Dublin“The ornate design of the exterior is of a significantly higher standard than typical apartment scheme designs and would be reminiscent of well-regarded architecture seen in London and Paris,” he said.“I think it would be unlikely that a better designed scheme would ultimately materialise in future on these lands.”Mr Kavanagh, the self-described “Ronaldo of the property market” 18 months ago left New Generation Homes, the high profile development company he founded with Pat Crean. New Generation made headlines from 2011 onwards when it spent up to €300 million buying up development land at the bottom of the market.Submissions on the Kilternan plan can be made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council until Thursday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Liverpool fan was violently assaulted before Champions League semi-finalAccused had \u0026lsquodelusionary beliefs\u0026rsquo said psychiatristHiqa says abuses at \u0026Aacuteras Attracta in Co Mayo were a \u0026lsquowake-up call\u0026rsquo for regulationProfessor of obstetrics and gynaecology says claim St Luke\u0026rsquos Hospital in Kilkenny is planning to convert part of its premises into an abortion clinic is \u0026lsquoabsolute nonsense of the highest order\u0026rsquoHundreds of mourners celebrate the life of teenager who came to national prominence after his appearance on RT\u0026Eacute\u0026rsquos Room to ImprovePosters depicting Minister\u0026rsquos face alongside aborted foetus erected near his Wicklow homeIrish Rail says attack \u0026lsquoexposes the lie that graffiti vandals are engaged in some sort of artistic endeavour\u0026rsquoLess than half the women calling CervicalCheck helpline have received a call backDiarmuid Martin warns \u0026lsquothere is an underbelly which we ignore at our peril\u0026rsquoTV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme\u0026lsquoSinn F\u0026eacutein has a habit of making the story about themselves.

The bands on all three rings are diamond-encrusted.A vivid yellow cushion-shaped diamond ring encased in smaller oval and round-shaped diamondsAn emerald-cut diamond ring with purple and pink stones, and four pear-shaped diamondsLast year Scotland Yard issued pictures of two men they said they wanted to question in connection with the raid, but they have now said they believe one of the men is Osmakcic, and they have reissued his picture in a fresh attempt to solve the case.Detective Sergeant Chris Taylor, of Kensington and Chelsea CID, said: This was a well-planned and audacious theft committed in the middle of a busy art fair.We are re-releasing the image of Mr Osmakcic in an attempt to trace him. It is highly likely that Mr Osmakcic may be out of the UK, possibly in Europe.He may also be known by the following name Vinko Tomic or Juro Markelic.DS Taylor added: I am asking anyone who knows his whereabouts to contact police or Crimestoppers so we can bring him to justice.Vinko Osmakcic AKA Juro Markelic was arrested in Las Vegas The Pink Panther gang has been linked to a string of audacious raids around the globe dating back to the early 1990s, when they were thought to operate out of Japan.In 1992 they were suspected of stealing a diamond worth half a million pounds from an international jewellery show in Hong Kong.But they were also linked to similar raids in Thailand, Japan, Switzerland, Germany, Monaco and Hawaii.The Graff jewellery store in Mayfair was targeted by the Pink Panther gangIn 2003 the gang was thought to have pulled off a £23 million raid at the Graff jewellery store in London.In 2010 Osmakcic, who is described as speaking in heavily accented English, was suspected of being part of a gang of four who stole a necklace worth £1 million from a jewellery store in Las Vegas.Seven months later Osmakcic was arrested after being spotted by an undercover officer at a jewellery trade fair in Las Vegas.He was charged with theft, but maintained his innocence claiming he was a self employed chef with an income of a £1,000 a month.In March 2004 he pleaded guilty to theft and after cutting a deal with prosecutors was sentenced to one year in prison.But wanted for a string of other offences, the authorities in California applied for his extradition, where he was charged with the theft of a £35,000 worth of gems.He again pleaded guilty but while he was serving his sentence became the subject of an extradition application from the authorities in Hawaii.Vinko Osmakcic AKA Juro Markelic was arrested in Monaco in 2009As part of his defence, Osmakcic claimed he had been a soldier in the Bosnian war, but had turned to crime in order to support his displaced family.In a letter to the judge, he wrote: In 1992 my village was attacked and fully destroyed. Everybody from my family was in the street overnight.The only hope I had was to leave my country and do whatever it took to help my family survive … I am not looking for any excuses for what I did. I just wanted to explain my wrongful doings … I hope you honor may understand my situation.In 2006 he was sentenced to 21 months in Hawaii, but was released eight months late, with his lawyer insisting it was highly unlikely he will need to commit other crimes.Three years later he was detained in Monaco on suspicion of casing out a jewellery store.  At the time he was wearing a watch worth an estimated £160,000.He was jailed in Monaco, but was released several months later and subsequently disappeared.Law and orderLibyan rebel leader who claims MI6 was complicit in his torture settles case with British governmentNew outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in Democratic Republic of Congo Ex-SAS boss who led British hunt for Osama bin Laden is appointed as new Army chief VE Day 2018: How the  covered Victory in Europe Day in 1945 Baldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39World\u0026#39s first wax figure of Meghan Markle unveiled at Madame TussaudsFury as supermarket petrol stations introduce £99 fuel \u0026#39deposit\u0026#39 to pay at the pump As Iran\u0026#39s president Rouhani tries to salvage nuclear deal, hardliners rejoiceThree US detainees freed in North Korea during Mike Pompeo visit No wonder the EU is furious, Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to its hard-won trade with IranAirline baggage rules put smart-luggage firm out of businessBenidorm latest resort to proclaim it \u0026#39won\u0026#39t tolerate\u0026#39 rowdy British touristsBMW to recall 312,000 cars after finding engines could cut out while being drivenComment: Iran\u0026#39s aggression, not Donald Trump\u0026#39s, has sundered the nuclear dealMary Berry salad dressings recalled due to undeclared egg China builds system that can predict earthquakes \u0026#39three weeks in advance\u0026#39Crufts judge accused of failing to control dogs after her deerhound \u0026#39grabs Chihuahua in its mouth\u0026#39Mike Pompeo calls North Korean leader \u0026#39Chairman Un\u0026#39 in diplomatic faux pas ahead of Pyongyang visitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"irans president rouhani tries salvage nuclear deal hardliners","story":"Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, will face major resistance from the country’s supreme leader and its hardliners in his bid to save the landmark nuclear deal.Despite Mr Rouhani’s assurances that Donald Trump’s decision to back out of the agreement would not spell its end, conservative elements in Iran have already begun celebrating its demise.During the opening session of parliament on Wednesday, a group of hardline MPs set fire to a paper US flag and the text of the nuclear deal as they chanted “death to America”.Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran\u0027s government faced a big test to preserve the dignity and the grandeur of the Iranian people and warned against trusting foreign leaders.Iranian MPs burning a US flag in the parliament in Tehran.Their words have no value. Today they say one thing and tomorrow another. They have no shame, he said.Mohammad Ali Jafari, the head of the country’s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force dominated by hard-liners which answers directly to Khamenei, said it was clear from the beginning that the Americans were not trustworthy and that the move would have no impact.Mr Rouhani is hoping to receive guarantees from the UK, Germany and France, the European signatories to the 2015 deal, that Tehran could keep benefiting from the accord.Pro-government demonstrators hold posters of Iran\u0026#39s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (L) and Iran\u0026#39s founder of Islamic Republic,However, Mr Jafari predicted that the EU states, which opposed the pullout, would eventually join the US, making the the fate of the deal is clear.We welcome Trump\u0027s decision on pulling out of the deal. This is not a new event and has no effective role in any field,” he said.Mr Rouhani, a centrist, was re-elected with a landslide last year on the promise that the billions in assets unfrozen by the 2015 nuclear deal would benefit the people and end years of international isolation.  The US’s decision is a major blow for the leader’s reformist platform and plays into the hands of the conservatives who had warned of making deals with America.Iran\u0026#39s president Hassan Rouhani gives a speech in the city of Tabriz in the northwestern East-Azerbaijan province Analysts say Mr Rouhani will be weakened and only hardliners will gain.“Trump has violated the international agreement by his predecessor, (Barack) Obama, under the intrigues of the Israeli prime minister and Saudi Crown Prince Bin Salman,” said Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador to China and an adviser to the nuclear negotiating team. “Now he has played in the hands of hardliners in Iran.”Ordinary Iranians will now be worrying about what decision could mean for their country.The Iranian rial is already trading on the black market at 66,000 to the dollar, despite a government-set rate of 42,000 rials.Some rushed out on Wednesday morning to take out US dollars, hard to come by in the Islamic Republic.Many say they have not reaped the rewards from the nuclear deal, which they say have not trickled down to the general population.Iran\u0027s poor economy and unemployment already sparked nationwide protests in December and January that saw at least 25 people killed and, reportedly, nearly 5,000 arrested.Demonstrators were also angry at Iran\u0027s involvement in costly wars abroad, including Yemen and Syria.“It is always us who suffer,” said one trader in Tehran told the . “It is not easy living in Iran, one day your country seems like it is heading in the right direction, the next it is spun around.”Katayoon Soltani, an accountant, told AFP: Even without sanctions, our economy was terrible. With this decision, I don\u0027t know what will happen. All my friends want to leave Iran. This is not a place where we want to stay, she said.Libyan rebel leader who claims MI6 was complicit in his torture settles case with British governmentNew outbreak of Ebola kills 17 in Democratic Republic of Congo Ex-SAS boss who led British hunt for Osama bin Laden is appointed as new Army chief VE Day 2018: How the  covered Victory in Europe Day in 1945 Baldness cure could come from side-effect of cancer drugMeghan Markle: \u0026#39I can\u0026#39t wait to be a mother\u0026#39World\u0026#39s first wax figure of Meghan Markle unveiled at Madame TussaudsFury as supermarket petrol stations introduce £99 fuel \u0026#39deposit\u0026#39 to pay at the pump Three US detainees freed in North Korea during Mike Pompeo visit No wonder the EU is furious, Donald Trump has taken a sledgehammer to its hard-won trade with IranAirline baggage rules put smart-luggage firm out of businessBenidorm latest resort to proclaim it \u0026#39won\u0026#39t tolerate\u0026#39 rowdy British touristsBMW to recall 312,000 cars after finding engines could cut out while being drivenComment: Iran\u0026#39s aggression, not Donald Trump\u0026#39s, has sundered the nuclear dealMary Berry salad dressings recalled due to undeclared egg China builds system that can predict earthquakes \u0026#39three weeks in advance\u0026#39Crufts judge accused of failing to control dogs after her deerhound \u0026#39grabs Chihuahua in its mouth\u0026#39Mike Pompeo calls North Korean leader \u0026#39Chairman Un\u0026#39 in diplomatic faux pas ahead of Pyongyang visitKim Jong-un leads the diplomatic dance on the Korean Peninsula, but the Iran deal\u0026#39s failure could imperil negotiations We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"mohammed kozbar libel settlement","story":"Mr Mohammed Kozbar issued a libel claim in relation to an article published on 13 March 2016 headed “Corbyn and the mosque leader who blames the UK for Isil”.

Stay tuned!”However of the three prisoners only one, Kim Dong-cheol, a South Korean-born American pastor, was detained during the previous Obama administration. He was arrested in North Korea in 2015 on charges of spying and sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.Kim Hak-seong and Kim Sang-deok, were both working as academics at Pyongyang’s University of Science and Technology when they were arrested last year on suspicion of “hostile acts” during heightened tensions with Washington over North Korea’s rapidly advancing nuclear and weapons programmes.Of all the US nationals held by North Korea over the last 20 years, Mr Kim has spent the longest amount of time in detention.Born in Seoul but a naturalised US citizen, he had been living in China and operated a business in the Rason Special Economic Zone when he was arrested in October 2015, although that was not confirmed until January the following year.He appeared at a stage-managed press conference in March 2016 and confessed to “trying to steal military secrets in collusion with South Koreans”. Seoul has denied any involvement in the case. Mr Kim was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour after being found guilty of espionage and other crimes against the North Korean state. Mr Kim, also known as Tony Kim, is a Korean-American who had just completed a one-month assignment as a guest lecturer in international finance and management at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. Tony Kim was accused of committing unspecified criminal acts intended to overthrow the governmentHe was also involved in humanitarian work in North Korea, including transporting foreign aid to areas of the country hardest hit by the flooding in the summer, which killed more than 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.Mr Kim and his wife were arrested on April 22, 2017 , shortly before they were due to board a flight at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport. Mr Kim’s wife was subsequently permitted to leave the country, but he has been found guilty of “hostile criminal acts with an aim to subvert the country”. Kim Hak-song was taken into custody on May 7 2017, and has since been accused of carrying out “hostile acts” against the North Korean state.Mr Kim had also been working at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, where he had been involved in agricultural development work. An ethnic Korean, Mr Kim moved to the US from China in the mid-1990s and studied in California. Colleagues described him as being “devoted” to the development of the North’s agricultural sector so the nation could become self-sufficient in basic foods. Foreigners detained by North KoreaPlease

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sales dropped by 3.1 per cent compared with April last year, the sharpest decline recorded by the BRC and KPMG since they began monitoring retail performance in 1995. While the figure for last month was affected by the early timing of Easter this year - with shoppers doing more buying in March, ahead of the spring holiday - economists still deemed the data a “weak report”. Sharp drop in retail job vacancies as high street crisis deepensFive things that show how online retailing will transform our lives“It is extremely rare for total sales to fall outright December 2008 was the last time our calendar-adjusted measure of total sales fell for two consecutive months,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Continued weakness in sales in April can’t be pinned on the weather - average temperatures actually were 1.1 degrees celsius above their 1970-2017 April average - or any other one-offs.”Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said consumers\u0027 discretionary spending power remains under pressure and added: “The reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.However, Mr Tombs warned: “The widely anticipated revival in growth in consumers’ spending is not emerging this year. While wages are no longer falling in real terms, households’ incomes were hit in April by another round of austerity measures and a rise in minimum pension contributions. “In addition, the rise in (interest rates) in November has prompted households to take a more cautious approach to borrowing and has hit the housing market hard, depressing consumers’ confidence.” Pantheon Macroeconomics is predicting that households’ real spending growth will slow to 0.8 per cent in 2018, down from 1.7 per cent last year.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was their second time in Israel, and the visiting couple were served a top-notch meal by celebrity Israeli chef Segev Moshe.Japan\u0027s Abe makes controversial offering at \u0027shrine to militarism\u0027Netanyahu\u0027s performance shows why Iran nuclear deal needs to remainBut then came dessert. A selection of delectable chocolate pralines - artistically arranged inside a shiny leather shoe.Israel\u0027s popular daily newspaper Yediot Aharonot wrote Monday that Japanese diplomats, Israeli Foreign Ministry officials and high-ranking Israeli diplomats who previously served in Japan were shocked by the idea.This was an insensitive decision, the article quoted one unidentified senior Israeli official as saying. There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won\u0027t find shoes in their offices. This is disrespect of the first order.Chocolate selection from the world 🌎 by #SegevArt ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  A metal shoe by @tomdixonstudioA post shared by  segevmoshe (@segevmoshe) on May 6, 2018 at 10:57pm PDTA Japanese diplomat, also not named by the paper, said: There\u0027s no culture in the world in which you put shoes on the table. What was the distinguished chef thinking? If it was humour, we don\u0027t think it is funny we were offended on behalf of our prime minister.Israel\u0027s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was not involved in approving the dishes for the meal.We respect and appreciate the chef. He is very creative, the ministry said.Trump and Shinzo Abe fail to agree on US tariff exemption for JapanMr Segev\u0027s creative side was displayed last May when President Trump visited Israel. Then, the celebrity chef served up a dessert in the shape of a double-headed Trump and Netanyahu.On Sunday, Mr Segev proudly posted a close-up photo of the offending shoe-filled dessert on his Instagram account, writing: Chocolate selection from the world by #SegevArt - - - A metal shoe by @tomdixonstudioThe dessert was served inside a sculpture by international artist Tom Dixon, whose works are displayed in major museums around the world and for the first time was displayed in Israel at a meal. This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe it is not a real shoe, Segev\u0027s publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.On Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is enquire about the guest. In Japan, shoes are considered contemptible, they always take off their shoes at the entrance to every home, both for themselves and for others, wrote one person.Another person wrote: you don\u0027t need to know any culture to know that serving shoes at a dinner is WRONG!World news in picturesWorld news in picturesNewly elected Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinian addresses the crowd in Republic Square in Yerevan.

You know the names: Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and many others. Did you hear anything about this in the media? Nothing! So open my Facebook and learn about this, said Mr Netanyahu in Hebrew.Israeli journalists responded by pointing out that the Hebrew media ran more than 50 items about various aspects of the trip, the Times of Israel news website reported. They also highlighted that the two leaders did not hold a news conference.Prime minister perhaps it\u0027s time to stop with the fake news!!! Not only did you not allow the journalists into your meetings with the Japanese prime minister, except for pool photographers, the media did actually report on this visit.

I will use all means to expel such people from the country,” Mr Deri’s statement said.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderOn Twitter, Mr Shakir said he had been ordered out of the country after Israel compiled a seven-page intelligence dossier on him.“Real aim to muzzle dissent.”Speaking to Reuters, Mr Shakir said: “I have not called for any form of boycott of Israel during my time at Human Rights Watch and the interior ministry acknowledged this in its letter to me ... in which they informed me of their decision to deny an extension to my work visa.”Earlier this year, Israel published a list of organisations whose activists will be barred from entering the country due to their support for boycott campaigns.Members of 20 groups which back the movement have been denied entry visas and residency rights under the controversial law.Last year, Hugh Lanning, chair of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, became the first British citizen to be refused entry under the law, and Professor Kamel Hawwash, a British-Palestinian citizen, was also forced to fly back to the UK when he attempted to visit relatives in east Jerusalem.The PSC and its supporters, including War on Want, brought a legal case against the British government in June 2016, concerning guidance which restricted local councils from pursuing BDS against Israel through their pension schemes. The campaigners argued people had the right to decide not to profit from human rights abuses, and the High Court ruled the government had acted unlawfully by seeking to restrict “ethical” boycotts of Israel.Israel’s strategic affairs ministry – the remit of which is tackling efforts to “delegitimise” Israel – has been allocated $36m (£27m) to combat the BDS movement. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The great charm is that the photos taken by the crowds over many decades capture all too rare moments when members of the Royal Family look genuinely relaxed and unguarded.The historian Dominic Sandbrook added: In many ways, this book could hardly be better timed. At a time when the monarchy is about to take a fresh step forward, with Prince Harry marrying a glamorous American actress, it represents a remarkably democratic glimpse of what, on the face of it, might seem a very old-fashioned institution. To some extent this is the story of a family who have proved extraordinarily successful in navigating between past and present, tradition and modernity, and to see that through the eyes of the Great British public for the first time, is quite special.Photobox spokesman Rory Scott said: \u0026ldquoAs soon as Karen Anvil\u0026rsquos world-famous picture of the \u0026ldquoFab Four splashed across every Boxing Day paper the idea of the book started was born. The ensuing journey has been nothing short of a photographic archaeological quest for long lost royal treasures lying forgotten in the nation\u0026rsquos attic archives. The public response has been overwhelming and I hope through the book and the myriad of candid, relaxed and informal photographs we so rarely see, we\u0026rsquore able to show another side to our Royal Family.The Crown from the Crowd was produced and published by Photobox to commemorate the royal wedding.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

They used to pre-authorise your card for £1 but now it is £99.“So that is money taken from your account that you can’t use until they release it back once the other payment has cleared.“My complaint to them was that they should have notices on the petrol pumps making customers aware of this as they have changed their policy, 5th of may we got fuel and were still waiting for our refund. Absolute joke.”An Asda spokesman said the fee was issued by Visa and Mastercard and is part of a trial at several stores.A Mastercard spokesman: Last year a change in industry rules meant that petrol stations with automated fuel pumps were required to pre-authorise a value equivalent to a full tank of fuel, so that customers didn’t fill up with more fuel than they could afford.This is designed to protect them, and the petrol station.If customers don’t have the required funds in their bank account, a further step is available to petrol stations which allows them to check what available funds a customer has, enabling a lower value of fuel to be dispensed.While some customers may see a request for a higher amount than the fuel they bought - perhaps on their mobile banking app - these funds are not taken from their account. Only the value of the petrol dispensed is withdrawn.A Visa spokesman said: “The way that pay-at-pump fuel payments are treated has been standardised across the industry to ensure security for individual cardholders, retailers and card issuers.“When an individual chooses to pay at a pay-at-pump fuel dispenser, an initial amount is held against their account while they dispense their fuel to ensure that they have sufficient funds to pay for the cost of their fuel. This initial amount should be adjusted immediately after fuel is dispensed to reflect the actual cost of the fuel.“Visa has been working closely with card issuing banks to ensure that consumers do not experience delays in the adjustment of the initially-held amount, however if consumers notice that initial amounts held against their accounts are not adjusted immediately, they should raise this with their card issuing bank in the first instance.”Other users expressed their anger at the charge.Charlotte Witcomb wrote: “What a joke.”Hope Sykes added: “It’s not like we have £99 for them to take in the first place.”Find the cheapest fuel prices.Use PetrolPrices. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles)Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:Prices at the pumps soared by almost 3p per litre last month, hitting millions of motorists.In February, we revealed how drivers face a postcode lottery with fuel costing £17 more if you live in the wrong town.The Sun Online recently revealed how soaring petrol and diesel prices mean Brits are paying an average of £60 more per year.Regardless of your vehicle, cutting down your fuel bill may be as simple as making a few adjustments to your vehicle and changing the way you drive.

Heleena wanted to keep her Australian passport so she didnt need a visa every time she went back to visit her elderly mother.The Home Office demanded she re-apply for her right to stay with reams of documents proving her years in Britain, and pay hundreds to do so.Rules were changed in 2006 which required additional information to apply for the right of abode.She had to track down her now ex-husband to get his birth certificate, passport, and proof of her National Insurance payments and every single address shed lived in since she arrived in the UK.After struggling with the situation and being made to feel like an illegal immigrant, she was then forced to hire lawyers which cost her thousands of pounds to work through all the documents.She claimed that officials said she was vulnerable to deportation at the border if she travelled to visit her family in Australia without the right paperwork.I felt suicidal, she revealed today, lashing out at the hostility of the Home Office.I thought, I dont want to live like this. I appreciate living in this country, but I dont feel valued.No one would listen to me.I was told if I didnt pay a certain amount to the Home Office that I could be deported.She claimed staff who she called to try and resolve the dilemma were rude to her and had picked on her case in order to meet the numbers required because she was an easy target.I was white, Im old, and they picked on me, she added.I was being deliberately targeted in order to reach their own targets set by the then-Home Secretary Theresa May without any intelligent thinking as to the consequences on entirely upstanding honest people like myself.Its an abuse of me as a human.After years of battling, Heleena finally secured her British citizenship in February 2017, and now has a British passport too.But she wants an apology from Theresa May and Sajid Javid - and compensation for the years of anxiety and uncertainty.Its all well to say for Theresa May to say that these people gave so much to this country... but you know what? So have I, Heleena said.Ive worked here for years, I had my children here.Why was I treated like this? Its absolutely disgusting.It seems they are only interested in ticking a box.Im not saying I should be treated specially, but I feel like Ive been completely victimised by a system that fails to understand the people.I have every sympathy for the Windrush generation.Last week Amber Rudd was forced to resign after getting swept up in the saga.She had claimed there was no such thing as deportation targets - but leaked letters proved they did and she knew about them.The desperate plight of Windrush generation immigrants has been highlighted in recent weeks after it emerged that thousands had been at risk of deportation for not having the correct documents.Despite coming to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s from Commonwealth countries and had been living here ever since, they had told to produce proof of their right to stay.One was denied NHS treatment for his cancer, and another missed his own mothers funeral because of the bungle.A Home Office spokesperson said today: UKVI staff are committed to providing people with appropriate and timely advice on how to progress their immigration case.Where we receive a complaint about the service provided, we will investigate thoroughly. UKVI use the complaints to constantly review and improve the service."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000391680056.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baldness cure shampoo","story":"Scientists found the therapy promotes speedy sprouting of hair in lab tests.It works by blocking a naturally-occurring protein that kills off growth and plays a key role in male baldness.Experts are “optimistic” the treatment, known as WAY-316606, could one day help millions of men.Researchers found the drug – originally developed for osteoporosis — boosted growth from human hair follicles in just two days.They now hope to carry out clinical trials on blokes with thinning patches.Lead researcher Dr Nathan Hawkshaw, from Manchester University, said: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.“I’m very optimistic it could work. In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.The only other option to balding blokes is hair transplantation.Scientists have also discovered a new drug that could cure baldness, especially in patients with alopecia.Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center found 75 per cent of patients with moderate to severe alopecia showed significant hair regrowth after taking the drug ruxolitinib.By the end of the treatment the average hair regrowth among patients was 92 per cent.Previous research has found that football players are more likely to go bald as repeated trauma to the hairline can cause chronic inflammation, which in turn can cause alopecia.Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men.It is a genetic condition that follows a pattern of a receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown of the head.It is caused by a hormonal and genetic predisposition.Each strand of hair you have sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle.Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair until, eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair.There are several options available to men who suffer from hair loss.Hair transplants: Removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them in areas that are balding. The procedure usually requires multiple sessions and may be expensive.Minoxidil: A solution that is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. It slows hair loss for many men, and some men grow new hair but hair loss will return when you stop using it.Propecia: A drug that interferes with the production of a highly active form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better than minoxidil but hair loss will still return when you stop using this medicineOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

knife-edge votes later today, the PM said the Government was confident of defeating calls for a new Leveson-style inquiry and punishing sanctions regime.She told Cabinet Ministers that amendments tabled by Labour MPs to the Data Protection Act could undermine a free Press.Several Tory MPs have indicated they plan to back calls for a new statutory inquiry into the media.A second vote on proposals to impose court costs on publishers that refuse to join a state-recognised Press regulator — even if they win — is “too close to call”, sources said.Culture Secretary Matt Hancock is trying to win over MPs by promising to review journalists’ exemption from the Data Protection Bill in four years.Mrs May’s official spokesman insisted she believed the idea of imposing court costs on victorious publishers went against “natural justice”.And he said it would not be “proportionate” to restart the Leveson inquiry.Former Cabinet Minister Priti Patel last night urged MPs of all parties to put personal grudges aside and defend the free Press.MPs will today vote on a law that will pose a real threat to the freedom of our Press.The bill being debated is important, because it will give people more control over how their personal data is stored and used.However, new amendments put forward by certain MPs are an attempt to hijack the bill and to use it to force newspapers to sign up to a state-sponsored system of Press regulation, as well as to hold another long and costly inquiry into events of up to a decade ago.I chaired the Parliamentary Select Committee that helped to uncover the phone hacking scandal.The behaviour of those involved was shocking and it rightly led to criminal prosecutions of those responsible.It also resulted in the setting up of Lord Leveson’s inquiry, which sat for 15 months and cost more than £5million.Since that time, a lot has changed.A new body, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), has been set up to replace the old Press Complaints Commission.It is fully independent and has powers to investigate complaints and to impose penalties on publications that break the rules, including front page corrections and fines.Most recently, it is introducing a new system of compulsory arbitration which the UK’s 15 best-selling newspapers have agreed to join.This will give people low-cost access to justice without having to employ lawyers or go to court.This new system of Press regulation fulfils almost all of the requirements set down by Lord Leveson in his inquiry.In all important respects it meets the tests for recognition under the Government’s Royal Charter.However, for reasons of principle, not a single national publication, nor the vast majority of the local press, has been willing to join a government-approved regulator.It is hard to see why some now wish to persist with an inquiry into the past when so much has changed.Today, it is not the printed press that exerts influence and makes money but social media and the internet giants.Nor is it clear why they should want to impose massive penalties on newspapers that do not sign up to an alternative regulator that has been approved by the state.Under their proposals, newspapers that choose to remain outside the Government’s system of Press regulation will be liable to pay all the claimants’ costs of legal actions brought against them on data protection grounds as well as their own, whether they win or lose.At a time when many newspapers are struggling, a lot would not survive.Some of those pressing the amendments have their own grudges against the Press.The amendment by Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson to the Data Protection Bill is a jaw-droppingly blatant and probably illegal attempt to shut down newspapers he dislikes.It would compel every paper to submit to controversial State-backed ­regulator Impress, funded by his own millionaire benefactor Max Mosley. Every paper, that is, except the Labour-supporting .Incredibly, it is exempt.The free Press would reject such control — so new rules would force us to fund any legal claims against us even if we WON. Investigative journalism would be axed overnight as too risky. Hundreds of papers could be bankrupted and thousands of journalists dumped on the dole.The winners would be crooked politicians, tycoons and celebrities — placed in effect beyond scrutiny — and the Labour Party, having silenced its critics.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” is just as bad: ANOTHER public inquiry, at vast cost, to rake yet again over the ashes of Press wrongdoing two decades ago.Even  opposes that.Maybe Miliband missed “Leveson 1” and all the (failed) trials of journalists.Maybe he hasn’t noticed that the Press is fighting for life in a totally new media landscape dominated by Facebook and Google, that it has changed its practices entirely and has a new regulator, IPSO, far more potent than any before it.The truth, though, is that neither Miliband nor Watson really care much about improving Press practices or securing justice for victims of intrusion. They seek revenge for The Sun abandoning Labour in 2009 and then exposing Miliband’s unsuitability to run Britain.They want a tame media “free” to churn out left-wing positions.If these amendments go ahead, the rest of the civilised world will regard Britain with horror.Dictators crush free speech . . . liberal democracies don’t.The Government, to its credit, opposes both proposals. Our free Press is not perfect, nor can it be.But Britain is better for its newspapers, and these toxic plans will damage our country immensely.They must be voted out.They have been unhappy about stories written about them in the past.I too bear the scars of having had tabloid press stories written about my private life.Some of these were inaccurate or purely salacious.That is the price of being in the public eye, although I also know the distress that such coverage can cause to others, particularly the families of those involved.However, the alternative of state controls on the Press is far more damaging and dangerous.The media play a vital role in a free society in exposing wrongdoing and holding governments to account.It is no accident that it is the world’s most authoritarian states which impose strict controls on their media.Britain is seen across the world as a bastion of liberty and human rights.It is essential that we reject these amendments and not put that reputation at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I didn’t kill anybody.“Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do.“None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that.I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.”The child snatcher was released from prison after serving just half of her eight year sentence and is now living under a new identity in the South of England.The born-again Christian now works in a Christian charity shop, where she says she doesnt feel judgedShe denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the ­homeless that had been handed out free by Pret A Manger shops.She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless.“This woman that’s a church person was handing them out.“It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station.

When I do talks on obesity one of my top ten tips is pay at the pump, don’t go into the kiosk, and people really get that.”Industry claims that regulations on advertising are already tight are a “shocking sham”, MPs were told, as junk food adverts regularly appear on YouTube and Facebook.Dan Parker, an advertising executive turned obesity campaigner, said rules that prohibited online advertising for junk food on sites where more than a quarter of the audience were children were useless.“This code does not include Google, or any search engine,” he said.“It does not include YouTube, it doesn’t include Facebook, Twitter or any other social networks.“It is a shocking sham. If I type My Little Pony into Google, do I see junk food ads? Yes.”Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said: “My view, which is in line with a consensus of academics, is that advertising has a small impact on food preference.“It has even less impact on overall diet and even less on overweight and obesity.”Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050, according to the NHS.About 27 per cent of the UK population is considered obese and a further 34 per cent are considered overweight, according to the latest Government statistics.Carrying excess weight, even if its just a little, has been linked to type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease and 11 different types of cancer.World Cancer Research Fund estimates 25,000 cases of cancer could be prevented every year in the UK alone if everyone was a healthy weight.According to the World Health Organisation heart disease was the biggest killer in 2015 followed by stroke, both of which were responsible for 15 million deaths worldwide."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005064524.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"labours emily thornberry suggests little miss books should be renamed because little implies women are worth less","story":"The Shadow Foreign secretary suggested the Little should be dropped from the female versions of the kids books because it implied that women were less.She told ITVs Good Morning Britain today: I dont like this thing about being little.

They can uphold 350 years of press freedom or stop newspapers from holding the rich, the powerful and the corrupt to account. In Britain we believe in decency and fairness. We want those who rig the system, whether it is MPs fiddling their expenses or slum landlords ripping off tenants, to be held responsible. And the main champion of the underdog in our open and democratic society is the Press. Yet the freedoms the Press enjoy – and with it the ability to expose wrongdoing – are under threat.  In the latest World Press Freedom Index, the UK was ranked 40th in the world behind countries such as Jamaica and Chile. And if two Labour MPs have their way today, those freedoms could be further eroded. Tom Watson and Ed Miliband have hijacked the Data Protection Bill by tabling amendments which could have serious consequences for investigative journalism, the viability of local papers and the openness of our democracy. What will the Tom Watson amendment do? The Shadow Culture Secretary is trying to resurrect a modified form of Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Court Act. This proposes that unless papers sign up to the state-recognised regulator IMPRESS, they will have to pay the legal costs of both sides in data protection cases, even if they win. The amendment exempts not-for-profit publishers such as the  and the Observer and titles in specific regions with a turnover below \u0026pound100million. But it would still cover 85% of local papers as most are owned by media companies, such as the Mirror’s publisher Reach, with turnovers above that amount. Watson is a friend of former Formula One boss Sir Max Mosley, who has harboured a deep loathing for newspapers since the News of the World revealed he took part in an S\u0026ampM party with prostitutes. He bankrolls IMPRESS through an arms-length charity and also gave Watson a \u0026pound500,000 donation to fund office costs and staff – money Watson has declined to give back despite the revelation Mosley published a campaign leaflet in the 1960s which linked non-white immigrants to diseases such as VD and leprosy.  Why should it be resisted? Local newspaper editors and freedom of speech campaigners say the amendment will cause irreparable damage to journalism. Editors will not be able to risk running stories exposing corruption or wrongdoing if they know it will result in expensive legal action. Jodie Ginsberg of Index on Censorship said it could be used by people to avoid exposure, even in cases such as the Windrush scandal where exposure is in the public interest. The main beneficiaries of Watson’s amendment would be those who want to wipe their grubby reputations clean by removing stories from the internet. This could include paedophiles with historical convictions or shady businessmen who want to start up their next dodgy venture. These are the sort of people who would threaten us with a data protection claim, knowing we would have to pay all the costs of the case unless we removed the articles about them from our websites, preventing you from seeing the truth. Mosley recently threatened the Mirror with a Data Protection Act claim concerning revelations about him that were heard in open court and are still available online. We are defending it vigorously. However, if the Watson amendment goes through, Mosley would get all the costs of his claim even if he lost, unless we were to join IMPRESS, the regulator HE helped found and finances through a trust. Media lawyer Antony White says the Watson amendment could also be illegal.  Who regulates the press? In the wake of the phone hacking scandal, the British press has changed the way it operates. Following the recommendation of Sir Brian Leveson’s inquiry, the majority of the country’s papers set up an independent regulator called IPSO. More than 2,600 print and online titles are now covered by IPSO which has the power to impose fines of up to \u0026pound1million and demand front page apologies for serious breaches. An independent review of IPSO by Sir Joseph Pilling found it to be independent, effective and compliant with most of Leveson’s recommendations. What is wrong with IMPRESS? No title of any significance has signed up to IMPRESS – and there are not just concerns about the motives of Mosley. It is governed by a Royal Charter, which in turn is overseen by politicians on the Privy Council. Any organisation that accepts it as its regulator also agrees, by extension, to state control. While the present regime may not interfere through the Privy Council, a future regime could use it to exert control over the press.

Unfortunately for the Labour leader the House of Lords gave a timely reminder last night that it is not just the Tories who are riven on the issue.  More than 80 Labour peers defied the leadership to back a cross-party amendment to keep the UK in the European Economic Area.  While this will almost certainly be overturned in the Commons (but not without a mini rebellion by the most ardent Labour Europhiles) it points to wider problem for the Labour leadership. Even if you put aside Corbyn’s own ambivalence about the European project, the party is wrestling with how to placate a membership which is overwhelmingly pro-EU without alienating further leave voting supporters in Labour’s traditional heartlands.  Last week’s local elections were a stark reminder of the challenge facing Labour.   The party failed to make gains in places such as Nuneaton, Basildon, Walsall and Derby - all former or current Labour areas which voted to leave. At the same time it is benefiting from the anti-Brexit backlash among Tory voters in the metropolitan areas. The risk for Labour is its policy of ambiguity on Brexit has diminishing returns. Purist Remainers could turn to the Lib Dems or Greens, while Leave voters will feel betrayed if Labour fails to fulfil the result of the referendum. There are two votes in Parliament today which are too close to call.  One will see Labour try to force the government to reverse its decision to scrap student nurses’ grants .   The second will see MPs look to impose fresh regulations on the press .   Tom Watson has tabled an amendment to the Data Protection Bill which threatens the future of investigative journalism.  There is a good explainer by James Ball in the New Statesman here of the problems with Watson’s proposal .  If his amendment is carried then papers could be cowed from challenging those with the deepest pockets: the multinationals and the millionaires. Unless papers sign up to the state-recognise regulator they will, with a few exceptions, be forced to pay the legal costs of any action even if they subsequently win the case. For a national newspaper this is sufficiently chilling, for a local paper it is a form of censorship. There is no way a regional title already operating on limited resources would dare to challenge wrongdoing by a local bigwig or company if they face financial ruin. Bizarrely, Watson is exempting the  from this measure but not local papers such as the Liverpool Echo. This means the  and the Echo could publish the same story but only the former would be protected. There are many questions about the state of our media.  The lack of voices on the left, the influence of foreign-based press barons, the dominance of Facebook, the spread of fake news, the lack of accountability of the tech giants, the group think.  All of these are worthy subjects for discussion.  Refighting old wars seems a curious sense of priorities.

Speaking at Prime Minister’s Questions, the Labour leader asked Mrs May whether she agreed with Johnson - poking the ever widening splits on her front bench. Mr Johnson smiled cheekily as Labour MPs shouted “crazy” across the chamber. But Mrs May insisted what was ‘crazy’ is that after years of opposing the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), he now finds himself wanting to sign up for a deal that would keep Britain inside the deal.  Corbyn pressed her to explain why she and her cabinet “wasted weeks planning up proposals that the EU said was unworkable”, and were described as a “fantasy unicorn plan” by former ambassador to the EU Ivan Rogers. Mr Speaker, she presides over a divided cabinet, she’s had 23 months in order to negotiate an agreement and hasn’t made any progress on it. The [Confederation of British Industry] says a comprehensive customs union after transition is a practical, real world answer. The TUC on behalf of six million workers in this country put it simply - ‘ruling out a customs union risks jobs.’ “The government continues to reject a new customs union, but at the weekend the Business Secretary [Greg Clark] made clear that neither of their options will be ready to be implemented by 2020.”  He challenged the Prime Minister to reveal what her preferred option was - and on what date it would be ready. Mrs May said “questions had been raised” about the two options she outlined in her Mansion House speech - “and further work continues.” She added: “We are leaving the customs union, what we are doing is ensuring that we deliver customs arrangements that ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, as frictionless trade with the EU as possible, and an independent trade policy. But what would Labour give us?  They want to go into a customs union with the European Union with no say over trade policy, with Brussels negotiating trade deals in their interests, not our own. The Labour manifesto said it wanted to strike trade deals, now they’ve gone back on that policy. Typical labour, letting Britain down once again.”  But Corbyn hit back: “How can they negotiate in the interests of people’s living standards when Cabinet members are more interested in putting their own futures first? “Fundamentally, Mr Speaker, how can this government negotiate a good deal for Britain to defend people’s jobs and living standards when they’re unable to reach an agreement within themselves?” "},{"url":null,"title":"save our steel campaign jobs","story":"NewsHundreds of steel workers plunged into fresh uncertainty after Tata unveils plans to flog off some of its businessesThe group’s European arm is seeking buyers for “non-core” units which supply products to niche markets\u0026nbspShareByBen GlazeDeputy political editor12:06, 9 MAY 2018NewsTata is seeking buyers for “non-core” units which supply products to niche markets (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCampaigners hit out at Tata Steel yesterday after the firm unveiled plans to flog off some of its businesses - plunging hundreds of workers into fresh uncertainty. The group’s European arm is seeking buyers for “non-core” units which supply products to niche markets. The sale covers five business units, including Cogent, which manufactures electrical steels based in Newport, South Wales Firsteel, which coats steel for kitchen bakeware based in Walsall, West Mids and Wolverhampton-based Engineering Steels Service Centre, which processes engineering steels. Other sites are in Canada, Sweden, Germany and Turkey. The units covered by the announcement employ a total of 1,100 workers, who face weeks of uncertainty.  It comes as Tata continues talks about a possible merger with German firm ThyssenKrupp.  Senior Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, whose South Wales constituency includes Britain’s biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “Tata has unequivocally assured the steel unions that it would not engage in the sale of any assets during the process of joint venture negotiations with ThyssenKrupp. “It is therefore surprising and disappointing to see that Tata appears to be reneging on that commitment.” Community steelworkers’ union boss Roy Rickhuss said: “Clearly this will bring yet another period of uncertainty to hundreds of steelworkers across the UK and will be worrying news for many of them and their families.  “We are yet to be persuaded of the business cases for these proposed sales and we are calling on Tata to demonstrate that it is a responsible seller in practical terms by allowing time for the unions and our experts to look at the rationale behind today’s announcement.  “No sale agreements should be signed before full consultation has taken place. “During our discussions with Tata about the merger with ThyssenKrupp, we secured a commitment that there would be no asset closures and this principle must be upheld throughout this process and any sale.” Shadow Steel Minister Gill Furniss urged Tata to “work closely with the unions to seek the most sustainable and responsible way forward”. She added: “During conversations about its merger with ThyssenKrupp, Tata made their commitments clear that there would be no asset stripping. “They must honour these firm commitments throughout any sale process.” Tata Steel’s European operations chief executive Hans Fischer defended the planned sell-off.  He said: “These potential sales follow the successful sale of other non-core businesses in recent years, such as Long Products Europe and Speciality Steels. “Under new ownership these former Tata Steel businesses have found the focus to secure a more sustainable future.  “In turn, these divestments have allowed us to focus resources on making significant improvements to the core strip business, as part of our ambition to develop the most sustainable steel business in Europe focused on our IJmuiden and Port Talbot value chains.

Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd (KAI) admitted it paid the cash to a company set up by Michael Cohen, the lawyer at the centre of the Stormy Daniels hush money scandal. KAI is currently competing to sell jets to the US Air Force in an auction that could be worth up to $16 billion. Details of the payments to Essential Consultants were revealed by Daniels\u0027 lawyer, Michael Avenatti yesterday. Avenatti also detailed payments by a company with ties to a Russian oligarch who has been sanctioned by the United States to punish Moscow for activities that included suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  Novartis AG, another company that made payments to Essential, said today that it was contacted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s office regarding the agreement. But a KAI spokesman said the company has not been contacted by Mueller\u0027s office, which is investigating Russia. Neither Avenatti nor Cohen responded to requests from Reuters for comment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said Cohen paid her to stay quiet about a 2006 sexual encounter with Trump, which he has denied. A KAI spokesman said it signed a contract with Essential last year for legal consulting concerning accounting standards on production costs, and upon the expiration of the contract it made the payment in November.

And he made a very good fist of it.  Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject.  Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. Corbyn’s questions were uncharacteristically sharp and direct. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy? was his opening gambit.  Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill?  The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?

Every day after work I would go for an hour long walk through my neighborhood.Honestly I didn\u0027t feel that I needed to go to the gym. I didn\u0027t want to spend the money on it. I had a lot of people come up to me and ask me, \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 I had a lot of family members who said, \u0027You look great. \u0027I feel a lot better now. I feel much more confident, not only in my looks but in my personality. I feel like I can talk to more people. I definitely have more energy as well. I could go all night walking around my neighborhood now.  Kaylene decided to make a change in July 2017 in time for her vacation that December, firstly by cutting out some of the junk she was eating. She stuck to her favorite breakfast of eggs but switched chips and sandwiches from Subway for grilled chicken and salads at lunch. For dinner, she ditched carb-heavy pizza and pasta in favor of protein-based meals and she completely cut out her guilty pleasure - chocolate. Instead of munching on Kit Kats and Reese\u0027s she opted for healthy snacks and she swapped coffee for tea, always ensuring she was in a calorie deficit for the day. Kaylene also took up her walking regime and by the she stepped on the plane to Mexico she had lost 40lbs. She went on to lose a further 20lbs after returning home.  I have always kind of been on the overweight side and I was self conscious, she said. Through my teens, being in school and comparing yourself to other skinny little girls who get all the attention from the guys - it was very frustrating. I wasn\u0027t extremely down about it but it always kind of bothered me. I felt unhappy. In summer you want to wear bikinis and dresses and I was very hesitant because I didn\u0027t feel great in them. We have four beaches in the town I live in and my friends would always go, but I would avoid it. I wasn\u0027t worried about comments, it was more that I didn\u0027t want to be around a bunch of really good looking people and I felt I didn\u0027t look good. My goal was to feel confident in a bikini. I just wanted to feel better and more confident and not worry about people staring. It was torture in the beginning but Mexico was keeping me going because I had it booked.

Laura Jackson, 32, says becoming a single parent had a dramatic financial impact leaving her living on \u0026pound2,000 less every month. Instead of spending money on healthy meals for herself, she made sure her children ate good food and she would sit alone in the house and snack on pizza and chips, chocolate and 50p biscuit packs.  Cooking a healthy meal for one is expensive and I wanted to save my money to make sure the children had enough, she told Mirror. I always fed them good quality food but biscuits, chips and pizza are so much cheaper than a chicken breast so that\u0027s what I would eat. And I\u0027ve always loved chocolate!  Laura would also make \u0027bad choices\u0027, eating too many takeaways and meals out in restaurants. I was going out loads and enjoying life too much, Laura said. I was a single mum and I gorged if I had a good day and I gorged if I had a bad day. I ate to console myself when things went wrong and to reward myself as a treat.  However, it wasn\u0027t long before Laura, then 28, piled on more than 6st and went from a size 14 to a size 22. One day while out shopping with friends she realised that she had gained so much weight that shops did not stock clothes big enough to fit her.  Determined to lose weight she started a meal replacement programme and a high protein diet but she still craved cake and found that many supermarkets did not stock any healthy alternatives to her liking. So Laura went home and started experimenting in the kitchen, baking healthy, protein-based snacks for her and her family and in doing so, she stumbled on a major gap in the market. Since starting The Protein Bakery in August last year, Laura has piled on the pounds again by building a multi-million pound business in just eight months creating \u0027healthy\u0027 guilt-free cakes. Her business has a projected turnover of almost \u0026pound3m for the first year and she has secured deals with two national supermarket chains. She counts Strictly Come Dancing and Emmerdale star Gemma Atkinson, a host of sporting professionals and The Real Housewives Of Cheshire among The Protein Bakery\u0027s celebrity fans.  Laura believes her determination was key to making it a success. People said \u0027you can\u0027t do it, you have no experience, you won\u0027t get retailers to listen to you.\u0027 But I was determined. I wanted a better life for my kids and I believed there was a gap in the market, she said. Her children, William, 10, Gabriella, 9, Elodie, 5, and Mila, 2, were her chief product testers and once they loved her cakes and could not tell that they were \u0027healthy\u0027, she knew she was onto a winner. I invested my own money in it. I Googled about business and recipes all night. I went into sales meetings and had to look up what business terminology meant on my phone to learn that language. I sent samples to celebrities like Gemma Atkinson, Christine McGuiness and Duncan from Blue with a handwritten note asking them to mention the product on their social media accounts if they liked them. Usually you have to pay for endorsement but I could not afford that. They were so kind and it really worked. After Gemma Atkinson shared my product on Instagram I got 700 new followers almost instantly. I think my story also inspires a lot of people. I was a single mum, struggling with my weight who became a business entrepreneur creating healthy snacks. I was scared at first to put myself out there but I realised that if you want people to buy your product they need to know who you are. Sharing my personal story really helped me build the business.  Her experience as a cash-strapped single mum also inspired her to keep the cost down. Her protein snacks will sell as three bars for \u0026pound2 as opposed to \u0026pound2.49 for one. I used to feel guilty as a single mum that I could not afford to buy healthier snacks for my kids. I want everyone to be able to afford these. I select my ingredients carefully and really think about how to produce them cost-effectively. I\u0027m also careful not to be greedy. I would rather work on lower profit margins so the products can be accessible to everyone. As a former dieter, she was inspired to create a high-protein product sold on the baked goods aisle instead of being hidden away on the healthy foods shelf - a first Laura claims for that product category. I want my products to be accessible to everyone so that someone like me can walk by and buy a guilt-free treat. A high-protein diet is beneficial to many people, not just body-builders or gym fanatics. They\u0027re made with healthy, everyday ingredients and you can make them at home so they belong on that aisle. Before her baking revolution she had a beautician business in her home town of Congleton, Cheshire, which employed three people but did not have enough to pay for extras like holidays. And in just eight months, what she hoped would be a \u0027pocket-money\u0027 business with an aim of turning over \u0026pound600 a month to save for a a family holiday, quickly became a booming business with a multi-million pound projected turnover.  She just signed a major deal with Asda which will stock her products in 350 stores nationwide from May 17 and in September she will launch with other major retailers. Laura said: I burst into tears when I was told about the deal. I had to really cut back on the kids to pay for packaging and ingredients for the business so to have that financial pressure lifted was incredible. It was like light suddenly dawning at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly I knew I could pay for simple things like my kids\u0027 school trips next month. Laura has an exclusive deal with a bakery to produce her recipes under her guidance and she will employ administrative staff this summer. I need to manage the business but keep time for my kids, I started it for them so if it takes my time away from them the whole thing loses its point, she added. A cookbook is also in the pipeline, followed by baking sets designed to make healthy baking affordable and easy and a cookware and utensils range. While she was on her weight loss journey, which began with meal replacement and a high-protein diet, she met her now husband Dylan in a bar in their local town. The couple welcomed their first child, Mila, into the world in January 2016 and married last year. Laura explained: I was a size 18 at the time and a single mum but he loved me for who I was. He helped me through the dark days when I just wanted to give up. He\u0027s been hugely supportive. Fake it \u0027till you make it: Have confidence in yourself. You can learn something really quickly if you put the effort in and it may surprise you just how much you can achieve. Networking is key: I had no contacts before I started using LinkedIn. Use networking events. By the end of the event you will have helped other people and found solutions for issues of your own. Use social media: LinkedIn was a vital tool for me to make contact with suppliers and retailers. Instagram was a great tool to promote my brand and the business. Goals: Identify what motivates you, focus on what you want to achieve and make small, achievable goals. Keep a clear budget: Costs can quickly spiral and cash-flow issues can arise quickly when you have to pay suppliers before payment comes from sales. Be realistic and very strict with your budget. Use Google and teach yourself: I used to spend all night researching the business online. Initially I did not understand what people said in meetings. Now I walk in and I understand it all. Have a story: Build your personal story and motivation into the identity of your business. A genuine personal story and sharing yourself with your audience helps them relate more to your product."},{"url":null,"title":"couple who weigh 55 stone","story":"NewsCouple who weigh 55 stone \u0027banned\u0027 from taxis after car suspension broke\u0027Marcus Edwards and Taylor Faulkner, from Hodge Hill in Birmingham, used to use Centrex Cars up to four times a day\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter11:38, 9 MAY 2018Updated11:42, 9 MAY 2018NewsMarcus Edwards weighs 36 stone and claims he has been banned from using Centrex Cars\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A couple who weight a combined 55 stone claim they have been banned from taxis because the 36-stone boyfriend broke the suspension of two different cabs.  Marcus Edwards and Taylor Faulkner, from Hodge Hill in Birmingham, used to use Centrex Cars as many as four times a day for rides to and from Edwards\u0027 mother\u0027s home a mile away from where the couple live.  But on Tuesday the overweight pair were attempting to book a cab and they claim they were told they had been banned because the 29-year-old had damaged two cabs due to his weight.  Faulkner, 26, who weighs 19 stone, and Edwards claim they are being discriminated against because of their size. Centrex Cars have denied they are banned and a spokesperson said they do not have vehicles big enough for Edwards.  Edwards is registered obese, has cellulitis in his legs, body fluid problems, and has blood clots in his lungs and heart.  He is appalled by the company\u0027s decision, as he has been a loyal customer\u0027 for the past five years and spends up to \u0026pound20 a day on the rides, he told the Sun .  He even books a five seater van when taking rides so they can fit his girth. Edwards told The Sun: I am obese because of my medical problems but this is discrimination against larger people like me, pure and simple. I don\u0027t believe I have knackered two cars\u0027 suspensions but I think they just don\u0027t want a person of my size around them. They should realise I suffer from a disease called obesity. After all the money we have spent with them they should be ashamed.

Flat Earth truther Gerrard Gallacher has been rejected by a number of the main national bookies because his request is invalid. The Grimsby man firmly believes it\u0027s a bet he would win - and says it would cost bookies millions of pounds.  Gerrard, who doesn\u0027t believe manned rockets have been sent into space, told the Grimsby  that the bookmakers know I am right and they should at least accept his wager.   He first began thinking that the Earth was flat a few years ago after becoming curious about the subject. Since then he has done his own research and is now even more convinced that Earth isn\u0027t round. Gerrard, who has tried to bet up to \u0026pound100, said: I think the reason that they won\u0027t accept my bet is because they know that I am right in saying that the Earth is flat, and if other people joined me in placing the bet they could lose millions. But then even if I am proven wrong and the world is round, then why would they not take my bet? It is just easy money for them.  William Hill are known for taking on crazy bets, I could go in now and bet my son will play for Celtic and score a hat-trick in 20 years, and they have even accepted one saying Elvis will come back from the dead, so why not that the Earth flat? I have tried everyone - Paddy Power, Bet 365, William Hill and Coral - but none of them are interested. I thought I had made some progress with SkyBet as they were open about it when I spoke with them, but yet again they came back to me and said they wouldn\u0027t do it. One of the main reasons he believes Earth is flat is the conspiracy theory that there are no real photos of the planet from space, and the existing images were generated by a Nasa computer.  Gerrard said: I just don\u0027t believe that we have ever sent rockets into space. I cannot comprehend that if space is a vacuum where there is no air, then what do the rockets propel against? I have also viewed footage of amateur weather balloons that clearly show to me that the Earth is flat, as I cannot see a curvature anywhere. Another reason that has convinced me is that apparently water is always meant to fall at a level and does not bend. So then how does the Earth manage to bend water all the way around a globe, it just doesn\u0027t seem to add up.

In her first full interview, for which she was not paid, she told the Mirror that she is not evil and insists she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Shannon was found sedated at the home of Michael Donovan, uncle of Matthews’ boyfriend Craig Meehan, after a search lasting 24 days. Matthews and Donovan were found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of \u0026shykidnapping, false imprisonment, and perverting justice. Both were given eight-year prison sentences. Last year, the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside about Shannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Karen Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. Here is what has happened to the people involved in the real life drama on the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in 2008.  Shannon was taken into care after the trial, and now lives with a new family. She is 19 years old now and was given a new identity which cannot be revealed. Karen Matthews Shannon\u0027s mum Karen was released from jail in 2012 after serving half of her eight-year sentence. The 43-year-old, who has a new identity, was relocated away from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. She has dramatically changed her appearance as the Mirror\u0027s exclusive pictures show.  Julie Bushby Played by Sheridan Smith in the series, Julie led the search for Shannon after her \u0027disappearance\u0027. She still lives in Dewsbury and has admitted she feels sorry for Karen Matthews after the ordeal. She visited her friend in prison monthly for four years in an attempt to discover the truth about what happened - but stopped when she didn\u0027t get answers.  “I just wanted the truth,” said Julie. “She kept saying other people were involved, I wanted the truth, to know who, why, what.” After Karen was released from prison, her contact with Julie stopped as the terms of her release meant she was unable to communicate with her.  Natalie Murray was another of Karen\u0027s friends who helped her in the search for Shannon. She is now a stay-at-home mum and left Dewsbury in 2009. Appearing on TV ahead of the drama\u0027s airing, she revealed she will never be able to forgive Karen. “It started when she did the very first interview outside her house,” recalled Natalie.  “I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview or speak to the press until they had as much information as they could get, and then they’d deal with that side of the press. It was due to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life at risk. But Karen did the interview. To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put a child’s life at risk?” Natalie said she “went straight down and asked her” why she did it, and claimed Karen’s answer was “everybody told me” to do it. “[I felt] angry that nobody listened to me or saw what I was seeing about her behaviour or things like that,” added Natalie.  Craig Meehan was Karen\u0027s boyfriend at the time - and his uncle Michael Donovan was found to have planned Shannon\u0027s disappearance to generate money from the publicity and search. Although he wasn\u0027t involved in the kidnapping, he was convicted of possession of child pornography after police examined computers at the home.  He was sentenced to 20 weeks imprisonment, but was released on the same day as he had spent longer on remand than the length of the sentence. The ex-fishmonger, now 30 and with a new name, had no part in the fake abduction. Michael Donovan  Michael was found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice for his role in the stunt. Along with Karen, he was sentenced to eight years in prison - and by the time she was released after serving half the sentence, Donovan had already been released. The Sunday Mirror published a new picture of Donovan snapped outside a coffee shop watching children playing nearby from 2012.

MirrorOnline reported on Saturday how Eric, a self-proclaimed devout Christian, was said to have funded a lavish lifestyle for Matthews - having helped her kit out her state-funded flat with top-of-the-range appliances and super-fast internet.   In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mirror today , Matthews - who has a new identity - denied claims he was her \u0027sugar daddy\u0027.

I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context.

Sources close to Matthews – who has dramatically changed her appearance – have previously claimed she has targeted older males since \u0026shyleaving prison in 2012. She is said to have posted profiles on websites for women seeking financial arrangements with men. One source said: “She has an \u0026shyimpressive lifestyle for someone who has been in prison for arranging the kidnap of her own child. “She puts on a good show about having changed but the truth is different. You would think she would be destitute given her past but she has somehow found a way to live a very nice life. “She had friends over for a party and there was apparently champagne and canapes – it certainly wasn’t on a budget. “She has a huge flat screen TV and a Samsung Galaxy 8 smartphone that she flashes about.”  Matthews, who claims to have found God while in prison, now works in a charity shop alongside generous \u0026shypensioner Eric. A source added: “She’s not getting that money from volunteering. “She makes no secret of the fact that she has older benefactors who keep her in the lifestyle she wants. “She knows how to manipulate \u0026shypeople to get what she wants.” Eric last week declined to comment on whether the relationship is sexual or if born-again Christian Matthews is paid for companionship.

But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil.

She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.  “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven.  Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds. Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked.  “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson.  She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle.

I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”  Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.”  When she goes out she puts a head band on to cover up her roots as her natural ginger hair starts to appear. She isn’t very well – doctors said she has gallstones – and she is on pills to ease the pain as she awaits surgery. Matthews said: “It scared me. I’ve lost six stone since because it was down to fatty foods. I used to eat lots of sweets but now I try to eat better.” Last year the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside, about \u0026shyShannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. In the past, Matthews has spoken to the Mirror about how the only thing she missed in jail was sex and \u0026shyshopping. In another interview she claimed she knew where Shannon was after she had been snatched – contradicting her own story. Karen Matthews has not been paid for this interview.

Leanne Bale and her teenage daughter Taylor formed a search party when Joe Cannon didn\u0027t return from a ride out on his new 125cc motorbike - bought so he could start another job. But they came across the scene of a tragic accident. Paramedics spent an hour battling to save the young dad after a heroic witness had tried to perform CPR. Leanna and Joe been inseparable since their first meeting in 2013 and became engaged on Christmas Day when the 30-year-old proposed in their living room. The tragedy unfolded in the village of Drybrook in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, just after midnight on Sunday.  Leanne has paid tribute to the “love of her life” who can never be replaced. “I loved him so, so much, my world will never be the same again,” she told Gloucestershire Live . As well as Leanne, Joe leaves behind their son Jai Jai, who will be two in July. His grieving fiancee said: “I’m not the only one, everybody loved Joe. He was an amazing dad and all the kids loved him because he was a big kid himself. “Everybody warmed to him because he was always helping people out and he made friends wherever he went. “He wasn’t one of those men who are too scared to show his feelings. When Joe loved you, you knew it. He was really soppy. “He loved us and he loved his family to bits. I still can’t believe he’s gone.” Joe had bought the motorbike online on Saturday because the general handyman and labourer was due to start a new job making glamping pods after the bank holiday weekend.  He was excited about the bike but was having problems starting it so took it for a late night test run around the village on Saturday night. When he didn’t come home, Leanne and teenage daughter Taylor went for a walk to see if he had broken down and came across the scene of the accident. As paramedics battled to save him for about an hour, a devastated local woman who had given Joe mouth to mouth until the 999 crews arrived spoke to Leanne, but she could not take in what was being said. “Never in your wildest dreams do you think something so awful could happen,” she said. “I could see the blue flashing lights and I was thinking broken bones and working out what to do because I thought I’d be sitting in A\u0026ampE for hours. “People were talking to me but nothing was going in. I just went numb and went back to wait. Then somebody from the police knocked on the door to say he had gone. Even now I can’t believe it.  “I like to think he was smiling. He hadn’t had a bike for years and was so excited to get one he could not stop smiling all day. “I didn’t want him to go out that night but he was so excited, he wanted to ride it.” Joe was born and brought up in a close-knit loving Mormon family to a school secretary mother. He also leaves a stepfather Jeff and siblings Beth, Nathan, Zac and Matt, who is currently working in New Zealand. The keen sportsman played rugby for the school and Gloucester All Blues RFC. “His mum says he was a cheeky little tyke at school and he grew up to be a cheeky, cheeky man, but he was our cheeky man,” she said. The couple met when Leanne saw an image on social media and commented that his son Tyler, who lives with his “lovely” mother in and stays with the couple weekends, and her daughter Taylor had the same blanket. After a week talking non-stop, nonsense to each other for hours at a time Leanne caught a bus to Gloucester to meet him. It was love at first sight for both of them and they have been together ever since.

A tribunal review today called a Restricted Parking Zone (RPZ) in Coventry city centre unenforceable and added that its signs were confusing and the public had been \u0027misled\u0027 The Traffic Penalty Tribunal ruling upheld six cases but the decision could land the authority with a heavy bill if it impacts the tens of thousands of drivers fined since the zone was set up. Between October 2012 and August 2017 58,536 fines were dished out - equal to about 30 tickets a day.  If all of those drivers fined decide to appeal to the Traffic Penalty Tribunal, and have their appeal upheld the council could be looking at forking out millions of pounds to make things right. If all of the drivers had paid the higher rate of \u0026pound70, the council\u0027s bill could be upwards of four million (\u0026pound4,097,520). Coventry City Council strongly opposes the decision and said it is taking legal advice on a possible challenge. Chief Adjudicator Caroline Sheppard OBE said the information about parking could be easily missed as some of the gateway signs had been placed in unusual locations and also close to signs warning about a change of speed limit. She also said there hardly any repeater signs present during her visit to the city and none in some of the streets where fines had been complained about. She said it would be particularly confusing for visitors coming to the university and those attending tourist attractions in the city centre, she added. She concluded: Coventry City Council’s enthusiasm for the concept of a city centre zone bounded by Ringway that they are blind to the fact that motorists unfamiliar with Coventry are confused and effectively misled into thinking that the street where they parked is unrestricted.

Parents and students at Mount Pleasant Primary School in Shrewsbury, where a school dinner costs \u0026pound2.20 per day, have been warned in a newsletter that arrears exceeding \u0026pound6.60 will mean the school will only be able to offer bread, fruit and water to pupils. Children falling foul of the policy are also being sat away from other pupils to eat. Mum Jamie-Lee Heath, whose daughter Madison attends the school, for four to 11-year-olds, said the rule was shocking and showed no compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. Jamie-Lee received a text from the school just one hour before lunchtime to say \u0026pound4.40 was owed and no dinner had been ordered for Madison. She said Madison had accidentally left her lunch in her father\u0027s car the day before and was given a hot meal, leaving her owing \u0026pound2.20. Madison went to school without money or lunch the following day and despite her father agreeing to pay at the end of the day because he had no cash on him, the school text Jamie-Lee who quickly managed to pay the arrears in time.  The 30-year-old kitchen designer said: My daughter left her lunch in her dads car and was given a hot lunch instead, putting her in arrears of \u0026pound2.20. I was completely unaware of this as we share custody and she was with him that entire week. The very next day the school refused to order her a lunch and text me about an hour before lunchtime stating so. I called up immediately and explained I would pay online straight away as I didn\u0027t realise she had arrears or no dinner money but also asked about what she would have been given if I hadn\u0027t managed to read the text in time. This is when the bread, fruit and water policy was explained to me. It had been mentioned in a previous school newsletter but I must admit I hadn\u0027t read it properly. I then wrote a status on my personal Facebook page alerting other parents who may have missed the newsletter about what was happening. People caught on pretty quickly and it was shared and commented on quite a lot with most people agreeing that this was just a step too far. Not only was my child not in the arrears amount threshold, I also pay \u0026pound50 plus a week in advance for her breakfast clubs, dinners and after school clubs which the school are well aware of. To withhold a hot dinner from her over the matter of \u0026pound2.20 seemed shocking to me and many others. Myself and others also agreed that the fact the child would be taken away from their friends and given a different \u0027lunch\u0027 in a separate room seemed like a punishment to a child and could easily create upset or bullying opportunities.  To take such a sharp stance on such a small amount of money just doesn\u0027t tie in with how I imagine schools would like to be seen. No compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. I would have been at work when the text was sent. If I had missed that text due to being in a meeting or with a customer I have no doubt that they would have followed through with the bread and water. I work 40 plus hours a week as a kitchen designer but luckily that week was my first week of maternity leave and I was off. I also find it appalling that if indeed a parent was struggling to pay lunches for whatever reason, it is the child who would suffer. Surely the first port of call is offering support and help to the parent and a point in the right direction. Not segregation of the innocent child. My issue is with the policy and how it may affect a child. To be taken away from your peers and not fed the same meal that you would normally expect. For this to happen regardless of whether the parent is a repeat offender or it\u0027s a one time genuine error as it was in this case, is just not a reasonable method. We want our children to be alert and happy at school, as we all know children learn better this way. To do this they need a full stomach. I understand repeated missed payments must be frustrating to deal with, and it\u0027s surely not the best use of school resources chasing up parents who have forgotten to pay or are struggling to pay. But they are children. It is not their fault. There surely needs to be a rethink at Mount Pleasant and indeed at any other school adhering to this policy. The school highlighted the policy in their June newsletter last year.

James Shaw, whose eldest daughter, Ella, reached the talent show\u0027s semi-finals in 2015, was out with his wife during the \u0027girls-only\u0027 house party. He was supposed to be out for the night with partner Janine, but could not resist logging on to their home security system using the app. He was horrified when he saw four young men at the party - which was supposed to be \u0027girls-only\u0027 - and rushed back home to break it up.  Mr Shaw, 50, arrived to find Cameron Hull, 18, kissing one of his other daughters, and the teenager was given his marching orders, a court heard.   Hull was going to leave quietly but then realised he had forgotten his brand new jacket. When he went back to get it, he found the dad barring his entry and there was another bust-up in which Mr Shaw was punched in the face. Hull, who lives around six miles away from the Shaws\u0027 home in Langho, Lancashire, admitted assaulting the dad during the incident in March. He was handed a conditional discharge for eight months by Blackburn magistrates, and ordered to pay \u0026pound100 compensation.  Last night, the labourer claimed he and his pals did not know 21-year-old singer Ella\u0027s family lived at the home, the Daily Mail reports.   He reportedly said: We got invited to a party that night by the hostess’s friend. I did not know the name of the girl I was kissing. He added: We did not know it was Ella Shaw’s family place. Mike Church-Taylor, prosecuting, had told JPs that Mr Shaw had gone out with his wife but was keeping an eye on his home via the cam app. The prosecutor said: He saw four young men in the house and decided to go home. The four males ran from the house but the defendant then tried to get back in. Mr Shaw blocked his way and was punched in the face for his trouble. Damian Pickup, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the police before and had been invited to the party.  He was kissing the girl when her parents returned home unexpectedly, said Mr Pickup. It is clear she had been told she could have a small party but it appears they didn\u0027t expect males to be there. My client says the girl\u0027s parents went mad and much of their anger was directed towards him because he had been kissing their daughter. Mr Shaw cornered the teenager, from Blackburn, and yelled at him before kicking him out of the house, the court heard. He realised he had left his brand new jacket in the house and returned to get it, said Mr Pickup. He was met with further aggression and accepts he punched the aggrieved in the face.

Kevin Cooper taught at the St James School in Grimsby until he was suspended in July 2016 when the nature of his relationship with the pupil came to light.  At a disciplinary panel by the Teaching Regulation Agency, Cooper was banned from teaching againafter being found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct which could bring the teaching profession into disrepute, reports the Grimsby  .  Cooper\u0027s relationship with the girl was described as sexually motivated and he admitted he hoped they could start a \u0027romantic relationship\u0027 when she left school.  The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) hearing in Coventry was told that he had also contacted the girl via social media and gone with her to London. Imposing the ban on behalf of the Education Secretary, TRA decision maker, Dawn Dandy, said the ban was both proportionate and in the public interest.  She said she had taken into account that the disciplinary panel had found that Mr Cooper lacked insight or remorse in respect of what he had done. In some cases when bans are imposed on teachers a period of years is set after which they can apply to another panel to have the ban lifted. But Ms Dandy said she considered that, in order to satisfy the maintenance of public confidence in the teaching profession, there should be no review period.

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe. And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed with fans, royal-watchers and media around the world fascinated by every last detail. Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job. But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.  The actress was born to Thomas Markle Snr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting. Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s age-defying yoga teacher mum  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum too. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue to her age-defying physique. She met Meghan\u0027s lighting director dad while working as an assistant make-up artist at ABC television. They married in 1979 and Meghan arrived in August 1981. The couple were to split citing irreconcilable differences when their daughter was just six. Meghan has previously revealed that her African-American mum used to be mistaken for her nanny, and that she was once called the N-word because she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white, Meghan wrote in an essay for Elle magazine. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating. While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” Doria will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Thomas Markle Snr, the reclusive dad who\u0027ll walk her down the aisle  Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along. “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies. Like his daughter, Thomas Snr worked in entertainment, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic America shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. The family\u0027s situation was to improve when Thomas Snr won \u0026pound560,000 on the lottery. This allowed Meghan to be privately educated, and she regularly visited the TV sets were her father worked, including Married With Children. “There I was, behind the scenes of a glossy soap opera and a TV sitcom, surrounded by famous actors and their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, Meghan on her blog, The Tig.  Thomas Snr\u0027s split from Doria was bitter and he decided to leave LA for Mexico after declaring himself bankrupt with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. He now lives a reclusive existence near Rosarito Beach. There had been some debate about whether Meghan\u0027s 73-year-old dad would be lured from his retreat to walk her down the aisle. But Kensington Palace has confirmed he will be at her side on her big day. Thomas Snr will meet son-in-law to-be Prince Harry for the first time in the week before the wedding. Meghan\u0027s parents will also spend time with the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person. He has gone so far as to write an open letter urging Harry to call of the wedding before it is too late. Thomas Jnr was a little kinder during an interview he gave just after the news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged. It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” Thomas Jnr is currently estranged from his full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said. Samantha Grant, the step-sister who\u0027s writing a tell-all book  Samantha Grant - born Yvonne - lives in Florida and has three children. She lived with Doria, Thomas Snr and her brother during Meghan\u0027s early years. But like her brother, she now has a difficult relationship with the bride-to-be and will not be at the wedding. Now a writer and counsellor, she is confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008 The 53-year-old claims she has not spoken to her half-sister for three years. All hell broke loose when she revealed plans to write a tell-all book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister. She has also accused Meghan of behavior \u0027not befitting of a Royal family member\u0027 and accused her half-sister of distancing herself after the MS diagnosis.  However, Samantha did have some positive things to say during an interview with Good Morning Britain. She\u0027s very strong she\u0027s very worldly and educated, graceful, Samantha told the show, discussing Meghan\u0027s future royal role as Harry’s wife. I think she will absolutely be a compliment to her role and I think the public will be surprised by how graceful and lovely she is. Despite the animosity, Samantha wanted a royal wedding invitation. She is not believed to have received one. Tyler Dooley, the cannabis farmer nephew  Meghan Markle\u0027s 25-year-old nephew has revealed he is a proud cannabis farmer who will reportedly make a special potent batch of the drug called Markle\u0027s Sparkle. Tyler lives in Oregon, where recreational marijuana was made legal in 2015. Reports say Tyler is proud of being part of the industry, which remains illegal in the UK. The 25-year-old, who remembered being babysat by Meghan when he was a kid, told the Daily Mail : We are passionate about marijuana and all the good things it brings. Prince Harry enjoys a good party. I’d be happy to show them around if they ever come out here and educate them on the medicinal benefits of marijuana which helps everything from post-traumatic stress syndrome to insomnia to pain in cancer patients. Tyler, the son of Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, reportedly tried his first joint at high school but says he no longer uses the drug. Since it was made legal in his state, Tyler got involved in the business and is paid a commission for sales and marketing jobs.  Frederick Markle, the \u0027recluse\u0027 bishop uncle with a \u0027congregation of one\u0027 Frederick Markle, 75, is the brother of Meghan’s dad, but their lives couldn’t be more different. While Thomas ’s career too him to Hollywood, Frederick’s took him to Sanford, Florida, where he runs a ramshackle chapel and goes by the name Bishop Dismas. But despite being the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, he’s reportedly a recluse who can’t even work a mobile phone. “He is basically a real friendly guy but he doesn’t go for new ideas. He lives like a hermit. He’s got a cellphone but he can’t figure out how to switch it on. As for emails and computers, that’s all Greek to him,” a source said. However, while it attracted a congregation of around 40 in the eighties, these days reports claim that the only person who visits the church is the Bishop himself.

Natalie Agostinho has criticised the company after noticing one of their sponsored ads on Instagram. The woman in the ad is wearing a low-cut pink vest top, has a head full of curlers, her finger placed to her chin and is puckering up her shiny lips in a confused way, with the tag line \u0027do I need a financial advisor?\u0027. Natalie, 36, claims it suggests the woman has blown her cash on a hairdo and perpetuates the stereotype that millennial women can’t successfully manage their finances.  The company who created the advert, Local Financial Advice, said it regrets any offence caused by the advert, which was meant to portray a \u0027pondering\u0027 woman. The ad has now been pulled and a full review of the organisation’s sign-off process will take place.  Natalie, a HR manager from Manchester said: I thought it was going to be an advert for a blow dry at a salon but when I realised what it was for I got really cross.   It\u0027s that same old stereotype that women should leave men to do the financing because they aren\u0027t \u0027clever enough\u0027 to do it themselves.     It leaves girls looking like they are clueless and useless.   I think the way that the woman has her hair in rollers suggests that she has spent all her money on her hair and make-up and has no money left so needs a man to save her. It\u0027s insulting. The advert is saying that millennial women are more interested in their make-up than finances and are incapable of sorting it themselves, which is false. It\u0027s like we\u0027re all little airheads. I am personally really fed up with the daily sexism, it\u0027s all the same at the minute how women are treated and perceived. Natalie contacted Local Financial Advice on social media and claims she has yet to receive a response.  Natalie said: I haven’t heard anything from the company and don\u0027t expect to hear anything from them to be honest. We go through our whole life just dealing with daily sexism yet when we stop and think about it properly we realise we shouldn\u0027t have to go along with it. Women have to do a lot to try and prove themselves so we don’t live up to the stereotype that has been built. Companies having adverts like this really doesn\u0027t help us. What makes it worse is that as it’s a sponsored post it will only appear on a certain demographic\u0027s feed, which could be young females.

The man, whose name is not known, was filmed muttering the racial slur during a confrontation with customer Irby Fogleman on Friday at the Country Inn \u0026amp Suites by Radisson in Newport News, Virginia, US. Mr Fogleman, 36, said he spoke to the employee after his girlfriend had complained about their room after arriving at the hotel with his mother and young family because of a strong smell of smoke.  The dad-of-two said he began filming the worker when he told him to leave the hotel and later shared the resulting video on his Facebook page.  In the footage, the visibly agitated worker can be seen opening a door which leads to the hotel reception before approaching Mr Fogleman and telling him please get off of my property.

As the pair squabble back-and-forth, the hotel attendant repeatedly orders Mr Fogleman to get out before uttering f****** monkey as he returns to the reception.

Little Spencer Devlin, whose dad is British, was tragically pronounced dead in hospital after plunging from the second-floor balcony last Saturday. His heartbroken family have described how he climbed through a window after his mother Holly Bishop opened it a little bit as she cleaned. The 18-month-old had reportedly been following Holly, 28, around as he always did in the moments before the tragedy in the Algarve region. After he went quiet and out of view, his mum initially thought he was getting up to mischief and searched for him, his aunt, Jess Marach, said.  But as she struggled to find him, she reportedly began to panic. She then noticed the window was “fully open” and ran over to look outside. Horrifically, she saw Spencer lying on the ground, surrounded by people. “[Holly] saw little Spencer on the ground outside with people surrounding him and she ran straight down the stairs to him,” Jess told news.au . The tot, whose breathing was laboured, was rushed to the local hospital before being transferred to Faro\u0027s Algarve University Hospital Centre. He sadly died as a result of his injuries. His mum Holly, from Perth, Australia, and dad Robert Devlin, from the UK, are said to have been left utterly devastated by his death.  The parents live in the holiday resort town of Lagos, where Robert, 32, runs a business and where the tragedy happened at the weekend. Recalling the moments leading up to Spencer\u0027s fall, Jess said Holly had opened the window a little bit to air the property and let the floors dry. “She said he was then playing in the bathroom banging around on the cupboards and she went to tell him to come out and he followed her back to the living room.  She then continued to clean the apartment and again couldn’t see Spencer or now hear him either, she told news.au. She went on to describe the horrifying moment Holly - her sister - discovered her little boy had fallen 25 feet from the balcony.  The tragedy was a freak accident, Jess told the news site, adding that Spencer, born in Portugal, was a happy and smiling youngster. A GoFundMe page has now been set up to help Holly and Robert pay funeral costs and other bills while grieving for their son. A post on the page, set up last Sunday, a day after Spencer\u0027s fall, reads: Yesterday was the worst day of rob and Holly’s life’s (sic). Yesterday morning their little baby boy Spencer had a tragic accident and was taken to faro hospital in Portugal where they did all they could for him but unfortunately he just couldn’t fight any longer and last night their beautiful baby boy Spencer grew his little wings and left all of his family behind. They are beyond devastated and would like to let everyone know but at the moment would just like some time to come to terms with their loss and be around family.

A royal meets and falls for a regular member of public. Love conquers all and everyone, bar the baddies, lives happily ever after. In reality, it\u0027s taken a while - circa 2000 years - for the UK to get to this stage. To put things in perspective, the Duchess of Cambridge is the first commoner to marry a future king since Elizabeth Woodville, the woman who married Edward IV in 1464 in secret. Since 1464, other monarchies have embraced non-royals and non-aristos into their regal folds.  Sometimes, as with Japan\u0027s Princess Mako , sacrifices are made and in terms of happy endings, for every Grace of Monacco there\u0027s a Wallace Simpson.    With Prince Harry and Meghan Markle walkng down the aisle in less than two weeks, here\u0027s a look at all the recent princes and princesses who had their heart stolen by a commoner.   1. Prince Rainier and Grace Kelly This one needs no introduction.  American actress Grace Kelly, famous for her roles in Rear Window and High Society, met Prince Rainier III of Monaco while heading the US delegation at the Cannes Film Festival in 1955.   The two then began a secret correspondence and in December, Rainier flew out to the States for a tour, during which he met Grace\u0027s family. The two were engaged three days later, news of which ignited the world\u0027s collective imagination. Their big day was dubbed The Wedding of the Century - but spare a thought for Grace\u0027s family, who had to fork out a $2 million dowry for the wedding to go ahead.  After marrying Rainier, Grace retired from film-making, dedicating herself to her royal duties. She tragically died in a car accident on September 14, 1982 at just 52 years old. 2. King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson This particular union altered the course of history in a dramatic fashion.  Baltimore divorcee Wallis first met Edward, Prince of Wales, in 1931. She was still married and he had a mistress, Lady Furness. Three years later (and still unattached), the pair fell in love and reportedly consumated their relationship. His father, King George V, died on 20 January 1936 and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. Just a few months later he expressed his desire to marry Wallis. The Prime Minister at the time, Stanley Baldwin, presented him with three options: abandon the idea of marriage marry against his ministers\u0027 wishes or abdicate.  Not wanting to give Wallis up, but also wanting to avoid a constitutional crisis, Edward abdicated in December 1936. The year after the couple married and moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life. Edward married Simpson in 1937, the year after he abdicated, and in exile, moved to France, where he lived for the rest of his life.    3. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark A bit more of a fairy-tale story, Mary Donaldson from Tasmania first crossed paths with Prince Frederik at Sydney pub the Slip Inn during the 2000 Olympics.  As with the best stories, she had no idea he was heir to the Danish throne. The couple conducted a long-distance relationship for the first year, with Mary then moving to Denmark in 2001. Two years later the pair were engaged. 12 years and four children later, they seem to be happier than ever. Mary has also mastered the Danish language, and was able to come up with a quick-witted retort two years ago when one man passed wind very loudly during a speech she was making.  4. King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain This is a royal romance which raised a few eyebrows at the time it was made public. Letizia is the first Spanish commoner to ever have become queen. Not only that, but she was also a divorced TV reporter and presenter who\u0027d had a live-in boyfriend. This may not sound like a big deal, but it was pretty unprecedented at the time and, to some extent, still is.  The two met at a dinner party thrown by a mutual friend but their romance got off to a shaky start after Letizia initially turned him down for date. It took Felipe four more attempts before she agreed. They went public with their relationship in 2003, n announcement which took the public by surprise, owing to the fact Letizia was divorced. But because her first marriage was only a civil ceremony, the Catholic Church didn\u0027t demand an annulment for the couple to marry, which they did in 2004.  5. Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Prince Daniel Another couple who bucked the trend and had a more modern romance, Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden met her husband at the gym. Then known as Daniel Westling, the now Duke of V\u0026aumlsterg\u0026oumltland was the princess\u0027 personal trainer. News of their relationship broke in 2002 and in an interview with a Japanese newspaper in 2005 she said: I think the general idea with the Swedes is that the modern way is to marry someone you love, not necessarily based on where she or he comes from.  Four years later their engagement was announced and the couple wed in 2010. The couple have two children together. Both Victoria\u0027s sister, Madeleine, and brother Carl Philip also married non-titled partners.

Eventually, her doubts were realised when an employee from a nearby zoo confirmed the pet was a domesticated fox, it was reported.

She said: The fur got thicker when it reached three months old. Its face became pointy and its tail grew longer than that of a normal dog. Before she learned the truth, Ms Wang said people using a park where she walked her pet told her that the animal was a fox. She added: Other pet dogs seemed to be scared by my pet so I walked it with a leash.  Ms Wang told Chinese media she fed the \u0027pooch\u0027 fruit, chicken breasts and dog food, which the pet stopped eating when it reached three months old. Sun Letian, an expert in animal epidemic prevention at Taiyuan Zoo, confirmed Ms Wang\u0027s pet is a fox after she brought her pet in for advice. He said: Based on the size, it is a domesticated fox. It carries a smell in their body and the smell can get stronger as it grows older.

Now, though, we will fancy our chances going back to Tannadice.”And Fraser believes the United playing surface will give them an added advantage in the second leg.“It was a typical play-off. There’s a lot of pressure on teams in these situations and you know winning or losing can come down to small margins, so it was all a bit frantic at times.“We were trying to get our game going on a pitch that wasn’t great, so that was difficult and it suited them to put the ball in behind and run.“Tannadice should suit us better because our surface there is good and we can pass the ball. We’ll water the pitch and that will suit us when we get the ball down and try to pass it out from the back.”He’s also in no doubt knowledge gained from previous play-offs also has to give them an edge.“We do have a few boys who were in the play-offs last year with us or have played in them for other teams in the past and that helps. We know what to expect and how to handle it.“Last year at this stage we went down to Morton and got a good result, then came back to Tannadice and won well and we’ll be looking to do the same again tonight.“We’ve also got a lot of experienced boys like Scott McDonald, Bilel Mohsni and Willo Flood and they’re all a big help.”After his long injury lay-off because of well-documented problems with a broken foot, starting two games in three days will be a challenge, but he reckons he’s back to 100% fitness.“I’ve been working hard on it over the past couple of weeks and I was happy with the way I got through the 90 minutes on Tuesday.“We had the wee break last week in terms of no midweek game for a change and that meant I was able to put in some good work in training.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.

You can be tattooing for 10 hours but it was an amazing experience.” Hue, who was previously a performance artist said she has appeared in pop videos and did some advertising — but the latest venture is something new.She added: “I have always wanted to be an artist — but it is quite hard to make a living as one.“I started tattooing in Dundee but it wasn’t the way I wanted to go in the industry.“So I just travelled around the world and learned from artists I respected and admired, getting tattooed from them.“Just learning from them — that is really how I got to where I am now.”Despite her recent successes, Hue is keeping her feet on the ground.She added: “I just want to tattoo for as long as I can and just keep on loving what I do.“If anything else comes along then that is great but tattooing is my main ambition.”Hue said she thinks locals will love the “crazy” show.She said: “You just wouldn’t believe some of the things that happened — it was such a crazy, funny time.“I don’t think people would even believe me if I told them but take my word for it — it is crazy”.Just Tattoo of Us series three premieres on May 21 at 10pm, on MTV.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/ohara-collage-940x564.jpg ","title":"toothless mark ohara epitomises dundees spirit says boss mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee manager Neil McCann praised midfielder Mark O’Hara after he went off at half-time in their 1-0 win over Hamilton missing his two front teeth.The 22-year-old felt the full force of an aerial collision with Accies’ Danny Redmond after 10 minutes but powered through to complete the first 45.He was replaced by Lewis Spence at the break after Kevin Holt had given the Dark Blues a 1-0 first-half lead with a powerful strike.Elliott Parish saved an 86th-minute Dougie Imrie penalty to secure the three points and all-but guarantee Premiership safety for another season.It was a collective effort which saw the Dee over the line but Neil took the time to single out O’Hara for his battling performance in the team display.“He was immense on Saturday but I have to compliment the whole team, they pulled together,” he said.“He’s not looking too bonnie and he’s not speaking too well either, he’s lost his two front teeth.“I think the groundsman found one of them, not sure if he’s got his second one yet but I thought it was a heroic performance to make it through 45 minutes because his face wasn’t great.“The big fella dug in because there were a few headers where I didn’t think he would fancy it but he did.“He was feeling a bit light-headed at half-time so we had to change him but I’m hoping that we can get him to a dentist and get him sorted out.“He’s a bit sore and was just one of the heroes on Saturday in what was a big performance.”Going into tomorrow’s contest with Ross County in Dingwall, Dundee cannot be automatically relegated as they sit eight points clear of their Highland rivals. However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win like the new dundee shirt here is how you can get it for free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee this week unveiled their sharp new home kit for 2018/19 – and the Tele has teamed up with the Dark Blues to give a free shirt away to one lucky winner.The hooped dark blue Puma kit was launched with the help of 50 young Dees at Dens Park on Thursday ahead of the strip going on sale on Friday.An adult shirt would cost £45 for an adult or £35 for children and £37 for a full infant kit.Answer the following question correctly, though, and you’ll get yours for free.So, thinking caps on, here it is:\t\t\t"}]
