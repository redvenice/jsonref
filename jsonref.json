It doesn’t help that he’s originally from Brescia in the north of Italy – “one of the biggest red dots in Europe” as he puts it.“It’s been incredibly intense,” he admits. “I found myself going online at three in the morning, to check the local newspapers to see if there were people I knew among the dead. When you’re living alone the news can get in your head. So you calling me right now is the perfect excuse to change the channel!”The project was commissioned with lockdown in mind, but Vezzoli says he’s long dreamed of hiring one of the big polling companies to survey his nation’s emotional state. Instead of a pollster, though, he’ll be using the poll function on Instagram Stories – each weekday from 11 May an image of a famous couple will appear and viewers will be able to vote for one of two pithy phrases written by Vezzoli. For example, a photograph of Miss Piggy and Kermit will offer the audience the choice between “non-binary couple” and “a love supreme” an image of James Dean and Marlon Brando gives you the options “Slave \u0026amp Master” or “Hair \u0026amp Make Up”. It’s not all pop culture – some couples are taken from paintings by Caravaggio or Toulouse-Lautrec.“And there’s one picture of Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret,” says Vezzoli. “They’re both looking at something that we don’t see in such a different way. Under the Queen the word says ‘finding’ and under her sister I put ‘looking’.”The project is, he says, about the complexity of relationships, as well as acting as a cultural barometer: “It will be interesting to measure how many people react to each image – have they forgotten certain icons that maybe in the art world we think are totally recognisable but are no longer relevant to a younger generation?”Each week’s results will be posted on Saturdays, and on Sunday Vezzoli has invited an array of cultural critics, historians and artists to comment on them, from Klaus Biesenbach, the director of Moca in Los Angeles, to “the most important ancient art historian in Italy” Salvatore Settis. I wonder how these critics will be expected to make sense of the poll’s results, given they seem rather open to interpretation – but that, Vezzoli says, is the whole point. “I have no idea what will happen!” he laughs. “The beauty of the project is that these people have total freedom to make their own interpretation of other people’s interpretations. Everything is up for critical grabs. It’s all a big collaborative game, a distraction … just a lot of fun to be honest.”Vezzoli’s work often seems “just a lot of fun”. It can be flashy, gleefully shallow, a little daft – but dig deeper and it contains political undertones. In 2009 he filmed Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams wrestling over a perfume bottle in an advert for a fake fragrance called Greed – all quite silly, yet clearly a satire on the Burlusconi era too.This work is no different, says Vezzoli. “There’s an image of Ronald Reagan dancing with Imelda Marcos where they’re both dressed in white satin,” he says. “So of course if you figure out who they are you start asking – why is the president of the United States dancing with the wife of a dictator? Did this really happen? So I think most of the questions are political, even if it’s just asking if Jenny is from the block or the yacht.”What Vezzoli seems most proud about with Love Stories is the fact that it’s a genuinely digital artwork. “You’re seeing galleries trying to digitise themselves in this moment … but being digital doesn’t mean a drone with a camera flying around your institution! Online viewing rooms are just analogue ways of thinking put online. With Love Stories, I don’t say if it’s a good exhibition or a bad one, but it’s a real digital exhibition.”It’s tempting to think that such projects will become commonplace as coronavirus changes the art landscape, but Vezzoli advises caution with any bold predictions: “After the Lehman Brothers crash there was a naive hope that it might bring a higher degree of morality into the art world,” he says. “Instead we saw the opposite – the rich in the art world got richer, the rest got wiped away. When this is over people may end up bingeing on comfort food rather than nouvelle cuisine. But then hopefully, after that, there will be an explosion of something completely new.“The world has seen tragedies like this before but never within a hyper-technological environment,” he continues. “We have no idea how this will impact on our brains. I haven’t left my apartment for so long that it has generated in me new emotions that I’ve never dealt with before. It’s unfathomable. I just hope that gentleness will be one of the feelings people respond with.”And will this project at least give the isolated Vezzoli a greater sense of human contact?“Oh yeah!” he exclaims. “Even just this interview is making me feel more human, more alive again! It’s been very healthy for my brain and for my heart.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17efcd182d70ecc31e7e56302da292e1e405c1ec/0_0_5184_3888/master/5184.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d891e4981a997f9b1a8b8212ed0bbce4 1010w","title":"eats leaves licks trees how koalas get enough water to live","story":"Study solves lingering mystery of how Australian marsupials stay hydratedScientists have solved a lingering mystery about koala behaviour: how they consume enough water to live.A new study describes koala drinking behaviour in the wild for the first time, finding that they lick water running down the smooth surface of tree trunks during rainfall – a phenomenon called “stemflow” – and do not rely merely on the water content of the leaves that make up their diet.The findings, which the researchers said may be useful in koala conservation efforts, were based on 46 observations of koalas in the Australian wild from 2006 to 2019, mostly at You Yangs regional park in the state of Victoria.“I think the main message is that behavioural observations in the wild are very important to establish what is normal and what is unusual, and to truly understand what animals need. If we watch them carefully, they will tell us,” said the University of Sydney ethologist Valentina Mella, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Ethology.Koalas, which are not bears despite a common misconception, spend most of their lives high up in eucalyptus trees. They rely on a diet of eucalyptus leaves, normally consuming up to 800gm daily. The word koala is thought to have meant “no drink” in one of the Australian Aboriginal languages. The question of their water consumption had long been puzzling.“Koalas have been alleged to never drink free water in the wild, or to drink only occasionally. Drinking behaviour has often been considered unusual and attributed to disease or to severe heat stress,” Mella said.“Koalas were thought to gain the majority of the water that they require from the moisture content in the leaves that they feed on and to drink water unintentionally in the wild by eating wet leaves after rain, or when dew is present on the leaf surface,” Mella added.Koalas sleep about 20 hours a day to conserve energy because their diet requires a lot of energy to digest. “Koalas are nocturnal animals, so they are only active at night, and they are arboreal, which means that they live in trees and rely on them for food, shelter and, as we just discovered, also for drinking,” Mella said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24562724e5f57d13c694e41df89e1a32a1c2455b/0_128_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d00e2dd2c8f0455c49c169bd431d320","title":"uk car sales coronavirus lockdown electric car","story":" Just 4,321 new cars were registered last month, after car showrooms were banned from staying open as part of attempts to limit the spread of Covid-19.It compared with 161,064 sales in the same month last year, and was the weakest since 1946 when the UK was emerging from war and resources were still rationed, highlighting the historic extent to which pandemic restrictions have hit the economy.The UK car market was already being squeezed before the pandemic, with confusion over fuel types following emissions-cheating scandals that prompted a consumer and political backlash against diesel cars. Brexit uncertainty also held sales back in recent months.The government is considering how to ease the pandemic lockdown without allowing the disease to spread again, but there are concerns that even a gradual easing of restrictions will do little to spur car sales once more, amid surging unemployment. The SMMT’s latest forecast for 2020 suggests there will be 1.68m new car registrations, the worst year for sales since 1992, when the population was smaller.The industry lobby group said reigniting demand would be key to saving jobs in UK sales and manufacturing. Production plunged in March to its lowest level since 2009, and the SMMT’s figures are expected to show a similar freeze in April. All large UK factories have also been closed during the lockdown, although some started to gradually reopen on Monday.Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said, “With the UK’s showrooms closed for the whole of April, the market’s worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising. These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector.“A strong new car market supports a healthy economy and as Britain starts to plan for recovery, we need car retail to be in the vanguard. Safely restarting this most critical sector and revitalising what will, inevitably, be subdued demand will be key to unlocking manufacturing and accelerating the UK’s economic regeneration.”Volkswagen’s procurement boss said reduced volumes had made components more expensive, further adding to financial pressures for manufacturers which are running production lines at lower speeds to allow physical distancing by factory workers.“If we continue to see lower volumes, parts will be more expensive,” Stefan Sommer told the Financial Times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cbe39a8de2a7e4ccd4788acc67f11f8b4124a93/0_86_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c721539e9aa518a778b4099c6b9bbc","title":"uk online grocery sales lockdown internet coronavirus","story":"Supermarkets ramp up internet operations as coronavirus restrictions drive demandOnline grocery sales are expected to surge by more than a quarter this year as the coronavirus lockdown prompts more families to shop from home.Supermarkets have ramped up online operations to serve millions more shoppers as fears of catching Covid-19 have driven demand from vulnerable shoppers, including the elderly, as well as families trying to avoid trips to the shops.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at research firm GlobalData, suggested that the switch to shopping from home was unlikely to reverse even if the government-imposed lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus is eased later in the year.Despite the rapid growth, supermarkets have admitted they cannot keep up with even higher demand.It takes time to develop infrastructure to service home deliveries, including additional vans, staff to pick groceries from shelves or new “dark stores” or warehouses.Ocado, the online grocery specialist, for example, has struggled to expand its service, because it relies on robot-driven facilities that take months or years to build. The grocers with physical stores have been able to adapt more quickly by setting aside time when supermarkets are closed to pick online orders or by extending click and collect or home delivery services to more outlets.The effort to meet demand has become more pressing as consumer and disability rights groups have warned that thousands are not getting the help they need during the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5aec9b49b6f5f467607ee0b452e9ef0a4f424da5/0_93_1928_1157/master/1928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83d0da1e1614ec6fb62f51e3c6cac26b","title":"uk car sales tumble services pmi recession covid 19 business live","story":"Virgin Atlantic plans to cut nearly a third of its workforce in response to the devastating impact of Covid-19BALPA, the pilots union, has called Virgin Atlantic’s job cuts a “terrible blow” to the UK airline industry.They say 426 pilots are at risk across the workforce(alongside cabin crew, ground staff and office workers).On Monday the union urged chancellor Rishi Sunak to implement a moratorium on job losses in the sector, warning that it faced a ‘death spiral’ otherwise.BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton says today’s announcement from Virgin highlights the need for action:“Our members and all staff in Virgin Atlantic will be shocked by the scale of this bombshell. We will be challenging Virgin very hard to justify this. “My letter to the Chancellor yesterday is all the more significant - why is the Government sitting on its hands while aviation plunges further towards a death spiral? Government should call a moratorium on job losses in aviation and lead a planned recovery.” Virgin is scaling back its operations so sharply because it believes the industry might not recover from the coronavirus pandemic until 2023. Following the pattern of previous crises including 911 and the Global Financial Crisis, capacity across the aviation industry will significantly reduce, with recovery to pre-crisis levels expected to take up to three years. Uncertainty around when flying will resume, coupled with unprecedented market conditions brought on by the pandemic, has severely reduced revenues for the global aviation industry and Virgin Atlantic. Virgin says it is now consulting with unions about its planned job cuts: Even in the toughest times, the people of Virgin Atlantic are what sets it apart and decisions taken have been aimed at preserving as many jobs as possible.In order for the airline to emerge from the crisis, regrettably it must reduce the number of people employed and today the company is announcing a planned reduction of 3,150 jobs across all functions. Working closely with unions BALPA and Unite, a company-wide consultation period of 45 days begins today. Newsflash: Virgin Atlantic is slashing more than 3,000 jobs as it tries to survive the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.The airline has just announced that it has cutting 3,150 positions, which is nearly a third of its 10,000 workforce.Virgin is also moving its flying programme from London Gatwick to Heathrow, and says it no longer plans to use all its 747-400S jets (although it hopes to return to Gatwick when demand picks up again).It’s another blow to Britain’s airline industry. Last week, British Airways began consulting on up to 12,000 redundancies, and Ryanair is planning to cut 3,000 jobs.Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic’s CEO, says the coronavirus crisis means it must cut costs - including reducing the number of staff.“We have weathered many storms since our first flight 36 years ago, but none has been as devastating as Covid-19 and the associated loss of life and livelihood for so many.“However, to safeguard our future and emerge a sustainably profitable business, now is the time for further action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and to protect as many jobs as possible. It is crucial that we return to profitability in 2021. This will mean taking steps to reshape and resize Virgin Atlantic in line with demand, while always keeping our people and customers at the heart of all we do. Virgin also says it is still in “constructive discussions” about financial aid with several stakeholders, including the UK government.More reaction to the German constitutional court ruling:Pfizer has teamed up with German pharmaceutical company BioNTech to test the potential vaccine on a group of US citizens. testing began in Germany last week. If the tests are successful, they hope to have millions of vaccine doses available in 2020, increasing to hundreds of millions in 2021.Britons haven’t been buying cars, but they have been buying an awful lot of food - online - and probably won’t break the habit.The latest data suggests that online grocery sales will surge by more than a quarter this year as the coronavirus lockdown prompts more families to shop from home.With major supermarkets expanding their delivery networks to cope, these new customers are likely to stick with online orders rather than brave the shops as often again. Italian government bonds have also been hit by the German constitutional court’s ultimatum to the European Central Bank to justify its QE stimulus programme.The gap between the interest rate on Italian debt, and safe-haven German bunds, has widened - a sign that investors are a little more edgy.Rightly so -- the ruling could undermine the ECB’s pledge to do ‘whatever it takes’ to hold the euro together. On the other hand, the ECB simply has to prove that buying up several trillion euros of sovereign debt was a proportionate response to the eurozone crisis....The recovery in the oil price is helping to lift Britain’s stock market.Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA explains:Production cuts combined with reopening measures across the US and Europe seem to be behind the rally in oil prices, although we’re still at extremely low levels and capacity is still fast running out.The oil price is rallying today, on hopes that demand will rise as countries start to ease their lockdowns.Last night, California announced that some businesses can restart operations on Friday, with restrictions to protect customers. Italy has begun to partially lift some of its restrictions, and Turkey is planning to allow more movement and shop openings too.Analyst Vandana Hari suggests the oil price has ‘turned a corner’ as economies emerge from their deep freeze. However, there’s a risk of a second spike in infections which could force new lockdown measures, hurting economies again..... Here’s our news story on the slump in UK car sales:Back in the UK, fast food chain McDonalds is taking its first step towards reopening from the lockdown, by naming the 15 restaurants that will start offering deliveries next week.They all appear to be in the South, with two in Chelmsford, while Luton-based burger and nugget lovers are spoiled with three stores.Legal experts and investors are still digesting the German constitutional court’s ruling -- but ING analyst Carsten Brzeski reckons it’s a “big bang”.Brzeski says the most relevant part of today’s ruling is the part prohibiting the Bundesbank to participate in QE unless the ECB proves that the programme is truly proportional (ie, that buying government bonds is justified by the economic and financial problems in the euro area). An optimistic interpretation could be this is lots of barking without biting and that everything is fine as long as the ECB demonstrates that it has thought through the economic consequences of its decisions but a pessimistic interpretation could be no amount of additional ECB analysis will convince German judges and could, therefore spell the end of QE.The euro is sliding after Germany’s constitutional court issued a long-awaited ruling on the legality of the European Central Bank’s massive asset-purchase programme.The judges in Karlsruhe appear to have dropped quite a bombshell -- instructing the Bundesbank that it must drop out of the Public Sector Purchase Programme unless the ECB proves, within three months, that the PSPP is needed.The ECB has already bought billions of euros of government bonds under the programme, which was created by former president Mario Draghi during the debt crisis.The court has considered a claim that PSPP was illegal as it amounted to the direct financing of eurozone governments. They concluded that the ECB needs to prove that the programme is justified, through “a proportionality assessment”.“The Bundesbank may thus no longer participate in the implementation and execution of the ECB decisions at issue, unless the ECB Governing Council adopts a new decision that demonstrates...the PSPP are not disproportionate to the economic and fiscal policy effects.Significantly, though, the ruling does not apply to the ECB’s new €750bn stimulus programme -- the pandemic emergency purchasing programme (PEPP).But it does still raise serious questions about the future of the ECB’s money-printing programmes, especially if the ECB doesn’t address these concerns.The euro has dropped by three-quarters of a cent in response, to $1.0833, amid concerns that the PEPP could be challenged next.David Madden of CMC Markets says:The ruling means the Bundesbank- the German central bank – can’t participate in the ECB’s stimulus scheme beyond three months, unless the ECB can come up with a new arrangement.Today’s news mean the ECB’s pandemic stimulus package could face legal challenges too. Hugo Boss, the German fashion house known for its sharp suits, has warned that things will get worse before they get better. There is obviously less demand for smart suits when people aren’t going to the office … meanwhile, the Berlin-based meal kit delivery firm HelloFresh is thriving. It delivered 111.3m meal kits in the first three months of the year as the Covid-19 lockdowns boosted demand for its pre-portioned ingredients and easy-to-cook recipes.Dominik Richter, the chief executive who co-founded the firm in 2011, says: “On top of our already very strong first two months of the year, our meals have attracted significant additional demand in the second half of March, as the global pandemic hit all of our markets in short order.”We also have confirmation that Britain’s economy suffered a painful slump last month, as the Covid-19 lockdown suppressed activity.Data firm Markit has reported that its ‘composite PMI’ index, which tracks activity across the private sector, fell to just 13.8 last month from 36 in March. Any reading below 50 shows a contraction, and this is the worst on record (going back to 1998) - by a long way!The service sector was particularly grim, as Markit explains, with most firms reporting a drop in business activity -- either due to business closures, shutdowns among clients or shrinking sales due to a slump in non-essential spending.New work, backlogs and employment across the service economy also slumped at a record pace. Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, says the reports shows Britain is entering its worst recession in many decades.“April’s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.Just one-in-five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March, and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.”Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, warns that the slump in car sales is bad news for Britain’s auto manufacturing industry: “With the UK’s showrooms closed for the whole of April, the market’s worst performance in living memory is hardly surprising. These figures, however, still make for exceptionally grim reading, not least for the hundreds of thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on the sector. A strong new car market supports a healthy economy and as Britain starts to plan for recovery, we need car retail to be in the vanguard.Safely restarting this most critical sector and revitalising what will, inevitably, be subdued demand will be key to unlocking manufacturing and accelerating the UK’s economic regeneration.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64eed70af2c43a9ccb227c04ae04e874717918fd/0_237_4234_2541/master/4234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d2e4e67d7170ca92d07e83c07d968b","title":"britain emergency planners pandemic government","story":"A pandemic has been warned of for years. But the government’s flat-footed response betrays its lack of emergency expertsTwelve years ago, I attended a conference on public health where a leading expert on pandemics introduced his talk by saying: “My task is to tell you things you don’t want to know, and ask you to spend money you haven’t got on something you don’t think will happen.” He then went on to describe, in considerable detail, a scenario for a global pandemic that was eerily similar to the one we’re currently experiencing.Fast-forward more than a decade, and it seems the UK government was badly prepared for the coronavirus pandemic. It’s not as if we didn’t have prior warning that an event like this was a threat. Though Exercise Cygnus of 2016 remains shrouded in mystery, the government’s national risk register of civil emergencies has long put pandemics at the top of the list of risks the UK faces. In the 2017 register, a virus symbol sits in the top right-hand corner of a diagram of likelihood versus consequences. The UK’s strategy for managing a pandemic, meanwhile, was first published in 2011. But by 2014, government attention had turned away from pandemic preparation and back to counter-terrorism planning. And by 2016, planners in the UK were fully engaged in confronting the supply-chain disaster that would be Brexit, struggling to figure out how, for example, to boost the UK’s coffee supply.Britain is experienced in planning for pandemics – so where is the emergency management of coronavirus? What we know so far about committees such as the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is that they appear to include no independent advisers on emergency planning and management. Expertise in medicine, virology, epidemiology, statistics and global health are all represented. So are behavioural sciences and psychology. Yet there seems to be a prevailing sense that the coronavirus crisis is primarily a medical and epidemiological problem – and that other aspects are mere fallout.This is not exactly true. Modelling the transmission of the virus, researching a vaccine and procuring antiviral therapies are of course vitally important. But there is more to the coronavirus crisis than flattening its curve. The measures to contain the virus are relatively simple – physical distancing, testing, tracing and isolation – but they are laden with consequences, both for society and for iniduals. Anticipating these effects and finding ways to mitigate them are the keystone of emergency planning.The coronavirus crisis is complicated by the fact we are living in a highly interconnected world, where one event can have a ripple effect across the networks on which we all depend. Halting international travel, for example, has left food producers without seasonal migrant workers to harvest crops. But the arrival of seasonal workers from abroad in the future could lead to a second spike of infections, particularly if they live in close proximity to one another. The issue of a second spike has already proved an issue in Singapore, previously lauded for its response to the virus. These are among the types of issues that emergency planners need to consider.Early attempts to deal with the crisis in the UK involved minimising its significance to the public and frantically improvising in a vain attempt to catch up with the spread of the virus. If plans existed, there was an abyss between the decisions mandated by the government and the reality of how they played out on the ground. This underlines the fact that emergency planning must be a live effort. Reality does not stand still – so neither must the plans for dealing with an emergency. Planners should be able to foresee urgent needs and prioritise them, providing enough personal protective equipment to the care homes that have become hotspots for the virus, for example, and knowing in advance how to source such equipment in adequate quantities.Numerous academics have presented fairly detailed scenarios for an influenza pandemic since 2008, which covered many of the social, economic and public health consequences that we are now experiencing. But we still don’t have a clear idea about the recovery process, and what actions the government should take to help society and the economy to recover. Although we can look back to the 1918-1920 flu pandemic for an idea of how long this recovery process might take – and the challenges that this period will present – it’s difficult to apply this knowledge to the current crisis when so much has changed.Emergency planning isn’t rocket science, but it’s distinctly challenging on many levels, involving intellectual, scientific and practical decisions. Wherever an event can be foreseen, the plans should be based on a range of scenarios. Planning scenarios aren’t predictions of the future but rather systematic explorations of hypothetical situations, answering the question: “What if…?”When disasters strike there should be three elements to the response: plans, procedures and improvisation. We can imagine the planner as an orchestral conductor, directing the members of the orchestra to play their sheet music. It’s the conductor’s job to ensure the musicians play in harmony, and although improvisation can’t be eliminated, it should be reduced to a bare minimum. Emergency planners will be needed to identify and meet the novel challenges that coronavirus presents – both now and in the future. Never have they been needed more on critical advisory committees.• David Alexander is professor of risk and disaster reduction at UniversityCollege London and vice-president of the Institute of Civil Protection andEmergency Management"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5924906cb4ab79ddfaafa9818004c762a7423ae5/0_201_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d486d14bdc4c40c16013afa42ac981","title":"harry and meghan are trying to rebrand themselves but they should take a breather","story":"The Sussexes have reportedly collaborated with a book about their split from the royal family. So much for pursuing a new life of privacyThe Sussexes’ noble experiment in living a quiet life, free from the glare of publicity attached to a royal title, continues. First they started a war with the British tabloids, fighting them over the misuse of private information in court while grandly declaring a new policy of “zero engagement” with a number of outlets. Then they moved to Los Angeles, a paparazzi-free zone perfect for people trying to reclaim their privacy. Now they have reportedly cooperated with a tell-all biography – Finding Freedom: Harry, Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family – that is coming out in August.According to a press release, Finding Freedom dispels “the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond” and was written with “unique access” and “the participation of those closest to the couple”. It is unclear how involved Harry and Meghan were with the book, but the Mail on Sunday claims they sat for interviews with the writers, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand (representatives for the couple deny this). Given their record, one imagines that, if they weren’t happy with the biography coming out, they would have issued a statement unequivocally saying so.If Harry and Meghan did give a green light to this biography, I can’t understand why. Let’s be clear: the racism and malice directed at Meghan by parts of the British media has been horrific. The pair have every right to try to take control of their narrative. But cooperating with a biography entitled Finding Freedom may not be the best way to do so. They had a row with their family and relocated they didn’t escape persecution from a war-torn country.Maybe before going full-steam ahead with their rebrand, our fearless freedom finders should take a bit of a breather, lay low and avoid baiting the media. After all, there is a fair bit going on in the world they may soon find that we are not all as desperate to hear about them as they seem to think."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84dd40a4b177c134f055219326f426176529b948/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=303cb0571ce7310e8221d90ee8b334d6","title":"sally rooney normal people hulu bbc soap opera","story":"The series adapted from the Sally Rooney novel is a tedious reworking of a romance plot as old as time. I’d rather read an honest bodice-ripperHere we have a young woman, smart and beautiful, but emotionally distant because she is a product of the cold, aristocratic upper classes. But she’s different, you know? We know this because she does things like look out of windows, daydreaming, which regular people would never dare to do.Then we have this young lad. He’s handsome and charming, sociable and popular. He’s from the working classes, which we know because, well, the show keeps telling us he is. And because his house is not as nice as her house.Normal People follows these two characters, Marianne and Connell, from high school to college, with a will-they-or-won’t-they story arc, with various forms of authorial interference to separate our lovebirds at various points in order to fill time. I thought I must be missing something. People love Sally Rooney. Her books have replaced those of figures like David Foster Wallace or Joan Didion as the books to be caught out with – “Oh, did this bestselling yet critically acclaimed novel fall out of my bag at the bar right next to the person I’m sexually attracted to? How clumsy of me!” – and adroitly signal to everyone around you your great taste and your with-it-ness in regards to cultural developments.But I was bored. I was bored watching actors with crows’ feet play 19-year-olds. I was bored watching these very typical representations of college students doing very normal things for freshmen, like throw tasteful dinner parties with all of the food made from scratch or dabble in S\u0026ampM (represented in the show as a little bit of hair pulling, which, sure). Certain that nothing was ever going to happen, I started jotting down the action of each episode. “Glances exchanged” was the entirety of episode one. Episode two, “vaginal penetration”.Perhaps what I was missing was the deeper meaning of the show. Maybe there was something there about Marxism. Rooney is a Marxist. Did you hear that hit Irish novelist Sally Rooney has Marxist politics? The author of Normal People and Conversations with Friends, she has Marxist leanings. I know Rooney is a Marxist because she brings it up in every single interview she has ever given.We get it, Sally. You went to an elite university. Elite universities are where Marxist transmission happens these days, after all. Saying “I’m a Marxist” is a more understated way of saying: “I went to Trinity.”The relationship between Marianne and Connell is explored mostly through power dynamics. She’s rich, so she wields more economic power he’s a white male so he has more societal power. Marianne’s wealth gives her a natural introduction to the children of the elite on Trinity’s Dublin campus. “Do you see that?” I asked my cat, pointing at Marianne’s circle of friends on the screen. “That’s social capital.”The characters say excruciating things, like “As a cis white male … ” and “It’s money, though. The substance that makes the world real.” Ah, there’s the Marxism I had been looking for. Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, iconic tome of socialist feminism, is flashed. Someone says: “Men seem more interested in limiting women’s freedoms than exploring their own.” The TV show analyzes itself for you with these offhand comments by the characters, so you don’t have to do any of the hard work of thinking, and they don’t have to do any of the hard work of delving into the complexity of contemporary heterosexuality.The desire to tell an old story in a new way only really works if you actually have something new to say. And bringing the power imbalances between the classes or between the genders to the surface of the story only counts as new if you assume that romance novelists throughout time, and their audiences, were completely ignorant about these dynamics. At least when these same stories appear in romance novels, chick lit, and romcoms, there are usually some good jokes, and the S\u0026ampM is more stimulating than just lying there limp while your hands are bound.For all its performed awareness about class relations, the show can’t maintain an interest in anyone who isn’t extremely attractive or extremely privileged. The only character who didn’t make the move from high school to university kills himself out of the hopelessness of it all, but of course that happens off screen and is only included as a catalyst for the reunion of our protagonists. And our hero, who struggles to make his way from vague, poorly defined hardship into the upper echelons of career-making education? He completes his hero’s journey into the creative class. He gets into that New York University MFA program."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8faf8f904a43433163dace7809015c4785e7a4e8/0_133_4052_2430/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=051957b4f47abf131e9d063f3c76aa69","title":"we created the anthropocene and the anthropocene is biting back","story":"It’s clear from a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticatedAbout 12,000 years ago, human domestication of the natural world began in earnest with the intentional cultivation of wild plants and animals. Fast forward to today and our dominion over the planet appears complete, as 7.8 billion of us multiply across its surface and our reach extends from the deep-sea beds, which are being mined, to the heavens, where we are, according to Donald Trump, dispatching a space force.Yet as has been made clear by a recent litany of disasters – from the coronavirus pandemic to America’s deadliest wildfire in a century – there are forces that cannot be domesticated. Indeed, our interference with the natural world is making them more liable to flare up into tragedy. We created the Anthropocene, and the Anthropocene is biting back.Covid-19 appears to have emerged in a Wuhan seafood and wild animal market, yet some scientists argue that its true origin story lies in the disruption of ecosystems. Genetic testing indicates that the virus probably came from bats, and at some point may have been transmitted via an intermediate species such as the pangolin, the most trafficked animal in the world. Although pangolins were not – officially – listed as traded at the market, it was certainly host to other wild animals such as wolf pups, crocodiles and civets.“Wild animals carry their own unique viruses,” David Quammen, the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, told Yale Environment 360. “When we go into a tropical forest with its great ersity, and we start cutting down trees, and capturing animals, or killing animals for food” – or sending them to markets where they can mix with farm animals and humans – “then we offer those viruses the opportunity to become our viruses, to jump into us and find a new host, a much more abundant host”.The risk of diseases spreading from animals to humans is in fact greatest when the animals concerned are endangered and in decline owing to trafficking and habitat destruction, a recent study found. The climate crisis and human population growth are “disease amplifiers”, according to the World Health Organization.Wildfires similarly show how our remaking of the natural world has had disastrous consequences. In our new book Fire in Paradise, which is based on our extensive reporting for the  and published today, we document the destruction of an entire California city in 2018 by a fire of unprecedented severity in modern times. Claiming 85 lives, it is the deadliest ever wildfire in the state.Wildfires are native to the western US in the same way that monsoons or hurricanes are native to other places. Yet a century of efforts to stamp them out and protect human lives and property in California has left the state’s forests and grasslands unnaturally dense with flammable vegetation that would otherwise have burned off in semi-regular but low-intensity burns. To make matters worse, global heating is rendering California’s wild places ever drier.Paradise’s residents knew of the sword that hung over their heads. The town had an evacuation plan and an emergency robocall system. In the summer of 2018, a horrifying and awe-inspiring fire tornado 1,000ft wide had laid waste to an area just 80 miles away. “It’s not a matter of if,” one longtime resident, Iris Natividad, told us. “It’s a matter of when.”Even so, no one imagined how bad it would be on that morning in early November, when a spark from a PG\u0026ampE transmission tower ignited the brush that surrounded it, at one point consuming nearly 400 American football fields’ worth of vegetation a minute on its sprint into Paradise. Flames that burned as hot as a crematorium melted cars and blowtorched thousands of homes. The fire trapped people in town and caught many unaware.Paradise suffered total devastation, and the images of neighborhoods reduced to nothing but piles of ash shocked the world. We’d say this was the new normal – except that actually “it would be a mistake to assume that the region has reached any semblance of a stable plateau”, three wildfire scientists wrote for the  only a few months before the Paradise fire. We know there will continue to be huge fires. We also know there will be more outbreaks, as a consequence of extreme weather, bioersity destruction, political instability, and expanded ranges for mosquitoes and ticks.Yet one optimistic lesson from the Covid-19 tragedy is that we can act. We will heed the calls to stay home, and we will condemn the economy in the process, if it means saving lives. And we will do it overnight.On our part-domesticated, still-wild planet, in the geologic era that bears our name, we’ve learned that we do indeed possess the willpower to prevent another pandemic, and another Paradise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed0242b88455b67703058dee5b08964ca4a5e43/0_406_6016_3610/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4702639dce5efd7d3e74e6336218178","title":"why cybersecurity presents the public sector with an opportunity to innovate","story":"For public sector organisations embarking on digital transformation, cybersecurity cannot be an afterthought – and by embedding it in projects from the start, they can continue to safely reshape public services Public sector organisations are embracing digital transformation to make it easier for citizens to interact with them. We see the benefits of this in our daily lives, whether it’s filing and paying taxes online, renewing a passport, booking a driving test or registering to vote. Offering services online means they can be provided far quicker and at a lower administrative cost, saving citizens time and helping government bodies to get the most out of finite budgets.However, because the services are now available through a computer or smartphone, there is an inherent risk of hackers gaining access to highly sensitive personal information.The public sector is now realising, as are many private companies, that this means cybersecurity can never be just an afterthought, and nor is it just a means of protecting online services from hackers.Important though that still is, digitally astute public bodies are starting to see cybersecurity as a mindset and a suite of enabling tools that help innovate new services to make life more convenient for the public. They also drive budgetary efficiencies through reduced administration, less paperwork and smoother running IT projects.As Stephen Wray, director of the cyber risk services team at Deloitte, explains, this means public organisations are now embracing cybersecurity as a vital consideration right from the start of a project. “It used to be a case of building something and then passing it on to the cyber team at the end of a project to see if it was secure,” he says. “Today, though, smart organisations realise they need to build in security-by-design throughout the entire process.”This is not just because compliance has been brought into sharper focus by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which offers members of the public more privacy and greater control over how companies and government departments collect and store their information.In Wray’s opinion, public organisations seeking the best advice will come to see compliance as “a carrot, not a stick”, because by ensuring secure-by-design practice is incorporated from the start to the end of all projects, government services are empowered to deliver optimal features and at the same time provide a defendable position should there be a cybersecurity incident.People expect any provider of public services to be as flexible as any private company they deal with. Rather than fill in forms and queue in a town hall, they want to press a button on a smartphone to access services. This digital first approach requires a total rethink about how security is applied.“Cybersecurity has just got so much bigger. It used to be about securing a clearly defined perimeter,” says Wray. “Now cyber is everywhere. It is foundational and an enabler for all digital technology. Organisations are having to think about the wider picture, often critical systems and key assets are not within an organisation’s control and a significant portion of the value of the organisation rests in its supply chain. They may have computer-controlled devices, such as security cameras or automated doors to a public building, or huge swathes of citizen data managed and maintained by somebody else. Systems are built on systems and things can get complicated very quickly. It is within this complexity that hackers thrive. That’s why you need to start out every project with security in mind from the start.”Deloitte is finding that embracing this approach of security-by-design is enabling public bodies to turn around the preconception of cybersecurity as an expensive bolt-on to a suite of tools that can actually boost IT efficiency. “When organisations build security-by-design into everything they do, they prevent over-specification of the solution and avoid putting in too many features that are often unnecessary, unused and expand the opportunity for vulnerabilities from a security perspective,” says Wray. “What we’re seeing is that when cyber is built in from the start, public sector bodies don’t overscope, they can get it just right.”And when they get it right, they achieve two huge strategic goals at the same time. Not only do they protect citizens’ data and help maintain the public’s trust in government services, they also keep pace with the public’s expectations for how they should be empowered to interact with those services. Rather than get left behind, the public sector can be at the forefront of designing innovative services.“People want to use the latest, smartest products and services, but they can’t unless they’re safe,” says Wray. “It doesn’t matter what new technology can do, it’s only of use if it can be made secure for the public to enjoy. That’s what makes cybersecurity such an exciting, enabling capability. Without it, you couldn’t launch anything new without risking the trust customers have in you.”Wray cautions that government bodies must not only work on the technology but also the people within their organisations. “People can be your strongest link,” says Wray. A user-enabled security approach means that well-trained and cyber savvy workers can contribute to the overall security posture of the organisation. A single compromised computer could provide a path to a treasure trove of citizen data. But healthy password use, security policy adoption and being able to identify and report phishing will counter some of the most prevalent and common attack vectors.Getting the people focus right and embracing cybersecurity throughout the life cycle of any new service is essential. When combined, these measures allow the public sector to delight citizens with convenient, slick new ways of accessing services that they might have previously only imagined was possible through a Silicon Valley startup."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bcdb06f9ceecdb2da38af728c9275eb9259e7ea/0_50_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f64267158cca83c5fbadc33d8a690c","title":"headteachers call for kinder school system coronavirus michael gove","story":"Ten years since Michael Gove’s reforms began, coronavirus shows up their failings, says the Headteachers’ Roundtable - and offers a chance for changeSchools closed, exams cancelled, a halt to Ofsted inspections and performance tables. Even the weirdest misfit futurologist employed by the prime minister’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, couldn’t have envisaged that, 10 years on from the start of the coalition government, the UK would be locked down with a partially functioning school system.Normal politics seems a distant memory. It could be 100 years, rather than 10, since Michael Gove, now a minister at the heart of the Covid-19 battle, was trumpeting traditional academic education, rushing legislation through parliament to fast-track academy conversions, and evangelising for a new generation of free schools with hotly contested claims that they would help to close the attainment gap.But, as schools grapple with assessing exam grades, virtual education and providing care for the children of key workers, questions are surfacing about what the pandemic has revealed about the last decade’s reforms – and what may need to change.The government’s new warmth towards teachers contrasts sharply with Gove’s often abrasive tone towards the profession. During his reign as education secretary, swathes of the education establishment were dismissed as the “enemies of promise”.Now some headteachers are looking for a more radical acknowledgment of what Covid-19 might mean. Stephen Tierney, chair of the Headteachers’ Roundtable (HTRT), a grassroots organisation set up in 2012 out of frustration with coalition policy, says now should be a “world war 2” moment.Tierney, who recently retired from a Blackpool school, believes the narrow “Govean” image of schools as vehicles for the transmission of knowledge – the former education secretary once described broader aims such as wellbeing and community cohesion as “peripherals” – has taken a knock.“The overwhelming image now is of schools relating in a very different way to their communities,” he says. “What does this moment tell us about what sort of society we want to build, and how schools fit into that?”The HTRT first met at a time when education policy was dominated by the introduction of the English baccalaureate, designed to encourage exam entry into the most academic subjects, and GCSE changes that, in effect, limited the number of pupils awarded each grade.“By the same token, BTecs in engineering and public services will be essential, won’t they?”Tomsett is one of few founding HTRT members still running a standalone maintained school. Rapid academisation was among the most controversial 2010 reforms, and most of the original HTRT group became academy chain leaders, defending the benefits of being in local collaborative arrangements.But according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank, set up after the 2015 election to provide objective analysis of education policy, the impact of academisation was minimal. For all Gove’s talk of a relentless “moral crusade” to narrow the attainment gap between the best and worst-off children, research suggests that at the current rate, it would now take more than 500 years to close.David Whitaker, director of learning for the Wellspring Academy Trust, which specialises in special needs and alternative provision education, isn’t surprised: “Austerity has hit our families hard. Cuts to social care, housing, and mental health provision mean more children are exposed to trauma and are cognitively impaired at a young age,” he says.The government has already tacitly acknowledged that Covid-19 school closures risk exacerbating attainment gaps, and has promised to provide laptops and boost broadband capacity for some families. But the economic shocks of the pandemic may deepen inequalities for years to come.David Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP, now chair of the Education Policy Institute, was a schools minister in the coalition government at the time it introduced a pupil premium to try to boost attainment for the most disadvantaged pupils.He now admits the impact of austerity almost certainly pulled in the opposite direction. “When poverty and the out-of-school environment are deteriorating, it becomes much more difficult to improve outcomes for poor children,” he says.“The choice is not between tackling poverty or improving schools – both are necessary if the gap is to be shrunk.” For one thing, he says, “we need to think more about how to attract the best teachers and leaders to the most challenging schools – higher per pupil funding, by itself, may not be enough.“Obviously, the current school closures are very worrying, and it would be surprising if the gap didn’t rise over the year ahead.”Laws acknowledges that schools with high disadvantage often find it harder to find teachers and may be more harshly graded by the inspectorate, Ofsted, making it more difficult to attract the best teachers and heads.The HTRT, which recently launched a Pause Ofsted campaign, believes the Covid-19-related halt to inspections and league tables should force a fresh look at how the accountability system affects the most challenging schools – and headteacher morale.Ros McMullen, another founding member of the HTRT, retired early from her job as an executive head in the Midlands, partly because heads were being treated as the “whipping boys for all the failings of social policy”, she says. “Headship can be very lonely, and people are frightened of being sacked or exposed. Michael Gove’s mantra was about giving heads control, but the truth is that I had less autonomy as an academy head than I did in a local authority.“This moment may provide an opportunity to think again about how to create a structure in which the challenges of a school’s context are recognised and heads can get their autonomy back.”Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, has called for a “rebirth” of the school system. “My hope is that we will come out of this more strongly demonstrating that it’s the human stuff that matters in education – the relationships, the socialisation of young people, the sense of an older generation preparing the next generation to take their place.”Another original HTRT member, Jon Chaloner, now chief executive GLF Schools, a 40-school trust, agrees: “The ideal, for me, would be an ‘education policy of unity’ supported by all the political parties so that, for the next 20 years, we are all committed to the agreed course of action”.Less focus on results and inspections, more value placed on a school’s role in the community, revaluing vocational qualifications and a unity approach to education would certainly be a different recipe from the past 10 years. But the Covid-19 crisis has forced government and citizens to act in ways that would have been unimaginable only two months ago.“There is a newfound respect for people who keep society running that requires us to think again about the true worth of key workers,” says Tomsett. “School staff are currently providing them with childcare so that they can save lives.

Others include expanding broadband so more people can work from home.“Tackling climate change has the answer to our economic problems,” Prof Hepburn told the . In their stimulus packages after the 2008 financial crisis, governments largely failed to capitalise on the carbon-cutting potential of their spending, partly because there was a lack of “shovel-ready” initiatives.This time, countries already have commitments to cut emissions under the Paris agreement, so there is a framework to require them to take account of carbon, as well as better awareness of the economic benefits of renewable energy, electric vehicles and other clean technology. “I think there is a better chance this time of a green recovery,” he said.The findings of the study, published in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy, provide academic backing to the calls for a “green recovery” that have been made by leading experts amid the Covid-19 crisis.The study also supports calls for any bailouts for fossil fuel companies or heavy emitting sectors, such as airlines and car manufacturing, to have conditions attached that would require the companies to reduce their climate impact.Brian O’Callaghan, also of the Smith School and co-author of the paper, said governments should act quickly. “Following large-scale government spending, there is often a hesitancy on the part of the public to spend more,” he said. “The natural inclination might be to take an easy pathway. But this is the single biggest opportunity for the government to shape the future decade, and it could give a significant economic boost.”The paper, co-authored by the Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, and Lord Nicholas Stern, the climate economist, catalogues more than 700 stimulus policies and makes comparisons with the global financial crisis of 2008. More than 230 experts, including senior officials from finance ministries and central banks in 53 countries, responded to a survey on the potential for climate benefits and fiscal recovery measures.Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and now a finance adviser to Boris Johnson for Cop26, called for all companies to disclose their plans to reach net zero emissions. “Every company in every sector, every bank and every insurer, every pension fund, should be expecting to develop and disclose a transition plan to net zero,” he said.The UK can seize the opportunity as president and host of the crunch UN climate talks to lead the way on an international green recovery, leading economists said, in a briefing to ministers to accompany the Oxford study results.The Cop26 summit has been postponed to early next year, giving time for the government to come up with a recovery package that would set the UK on a path to net zero emissions. The economists called for a new climate emergency committee, led by ministers, and for the UK to set up a sustainable recovery alliance with other governments.“The UK should link Cop26 with the Covid-19 recovery,” said O’Callaghan. “They have a real leadership opportunity.”Emily Shuckburgh, of the University of Cambridge, a co-author of the government briefing, said: “Shaping the national and global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic in a way that supports the response to climate change and other environmental threats simply makes sense. Not only does analysis suggest green recovery packages deliver greater economic benefit, but investing appropriately in research, innovation, infrastructure and skills training, and matching that with robust institutional structures, will help create a fairer, more resilient, sustainable world with benefits for all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3b8b524aa046c043df1051f8ec7ff698461cc0d/0_945_2244_1346/master/2244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b1dd2b2fe4ed9ebee3e52ab7725f79c","title":"judi dench becomes british vogues oldest cover star","story":"85-year-old Oscar-winner appears in the magazine’s June issueJudi Dench has become British Vogue’s oldest cover star, securing her first front page for the style arbiter at the age of 85.The Oscar-winning actor was photographed just before lockdown for the magazine’s June issue, but the accompanying interview explores her experiences self-isolating at home in Surrey.“I am sure I feel like everyone else, such unprecedented times are quite hard to comprehend,” she says. “What is a good thing is that it has made people aware of the predicament of others who are completely alone.

Are some women still wearing makeup every day?The shutdown feels like a good opportunity to examine an age-old feminist question: when women put makeup on, can they ever truly be doing it for themselves?We will probably never have an answer. The pressure imposed on women to look good is such a part of our existence that we might never get rid of it – even “dressing up for oneself” can be traced back to self-hatred fueled by a beauty-obsessed culture.But the shutdown means that we interact less with the outside world and the societal pressures that come with it. We asked women about their own relationship to their appearance right now. Are some wearing a full face of makeup every day? Wearing a bra? And who still dresses up, anyway? Here are their answers.Before everything shut down in Austin, I would put on mascara and lipstick (Clinique Chunky Cherry) every day, even though I work from home as a writer. My southern belle mom always taught us to “put on a little lipstick” no matter what – advice I hated as a teen. Somewhere along the way, I figured she was right. I still put on mascara and lipstick in quarantine, even though I know it’s ridiculous. It makes me feel human. It brings some normalcy to a very abnormal and scary time and It lifts my mood, even if I’m just walking to the mailbox.I grew a unibrow, named it Angelina: Conquerer of Space and Time. I wanted to see what it would look like since I’ve done upkeep since I was 14. I was disappointed by the results, which in no way made me resemble Frida Kahlo. Sparse. Too many years of plucking.I feel much happier with my natural appearance after a month in lockdown. I’ve worn makeup pretty much every day since I was about 14, even though in recent years I’ve cut down to just a bit of foundation and mascara. I believed I had an uneven and blotchy skin tone, but having now not worn a scrap of makeup for a month (probably the longest I’ve gone without it in nine years) I actually like the way my skin looks. I feel like I’m going to have the confidence to just stop wearing makeup once this is all over.Since shutdown, I’m not wearing whole parts of my wardrobe, getting haircuts or getting my hair colored. The only makeup I really wear is eyeliner and i still put that on when I’m going outside.As a trans person – I haven’t gotten the whole laser hair removal on my face yet, so I still shave my face and I have found myself not shaving, not consciously, but if i don’t go out I don’t do it. Trans-femme people can get really stressed out about body hair, but I’m fortunate to have very thin facial hair and body hair so I don’t notice it too much.Now when I look in the mirror I feel more stripped down. It’s not about confidence, it’s much more about the way I see myself. I see myself as very colorful and vibrant and so that’s why I dress up the way I do. Right now it feels like some of the functions through which I normally express myself are disabled. In the past i have thought of myself as pretty vain but now I realize it’s not about being vain, it’s about not getting to express myself, and feeling like parts of myself are stifled.I honestly don’t know how I’m going to go back to wearing a bra after this?I am 30 and rather overweight. Favorite dresses no longer zip up the back, and as all the shops are closed I’m having to order dresses online, without of course trying them on first. I’m eating somewhat wantonly: takeaways, large portions of meat and veg too. My face is unusually spotty. A couple of massive subcutaneous beasts lurk on my cheeks of all places, never rising to the surface. I put expensive green highlighter on them to make them less apparent, but now it looks like I have marker pen on my face. I doll myself up daily, thinking I want to look nice to walk my little dog. My leg hair grows and I shave it occasionally so I can wear my dresses.All in all I am discontented with my appearance in lockdown. I find all body types beautiful but I feel heavy and like my excess weight is tiring me out. I post maudlinly on social media about my excess weight and receive no likes. The lack of face-to-face contact with friends makes me blue, as well as lack of opportunities to go on dates and have occasions to dress up for.I think all I’ve learned is that lighting matters more than anything else? Oh wait, and also that my hair is so flat it looks drawn on with a pencil. Two lessons! Someone said that what we realize now is that the best part of going out to dinner with your friends is that you don’t have to look at your own face for that whole time. And it’s true – I have been recording my lectures and it is humbling, man. To watch myself on a video is the worst.Since the lockdown, I love to wear no makeup. It is the first time I feel beautiful without it. I also wear sneakers (I normally do not like them because it reminds me of my childhood in a poor, working-class family), and I do not miss business clothes. And I do not want to wear a bra again.I don’t have the same morning routine anymore and I am mostly wearing sports clothes. When I do take a shower, if I know I’m going to go running, I’ll put on sunscreen and a little bit of makeup – mascara and a little bit of eyeshadow. It makes me feel more awake and I feel like it’s nice for other people to see something nice. I am having a little fun with it – wearing mismatching or stripy tights or something a little festive when I run, because life is a bummer right now. We can’t control it, so trying to control what you can control helps a little bit.You’d think quarantine would see to me not taking care of my appearance and elucidate that this dressing up is for others. But it’s proved that I do it for moi. I love lookingfeeling buff. And as a Muslim when you pray you’re supposed to look your best, so may as well stunt to the heavens.Some names have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/351515c8842614fb6e399c33f19d23b5b24bcd9e/243_0_2498_1500/master/2498.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d187532f26789946aaa05d793832801","title":"i was overwhelmed with joy match the cast member to their cats quote","story":"Judi Dench has broken her silence on Tom Hooper’s musical, calling her Cats coat ‘battered, mangy’, ‘a great big orange bruiser’ and more colourful descriptions.

But that isn’t why you’ll read it. No, you’ll read it to witness Dame Judi Dench struggle to describe her Cats costume. She has several attempts at it.

When the sausages are nicely coloured, lift out and set aside, leaving the fat in place in the pan.Stir the sliced onions into the fat and leave to cook for 25 minutes or until the onions are soft and deep amber in colour. Stir in the garlic after 20 minutes.While the onions soften, cook 250g of small, brown lentils in deep, boiling water for about 20 minutes, until they are tender.Chop 200g of small, fresh tomatoes and stir them into the softened onions. Continue cooking for 7-10 minutes until the tomatoes have collapsed, then stir in 2 tsp of harissa paste. Slice the sausages into thick pieces and add to the onions.Drain the lentils and incorporate them into the tomatoes, onions and sausages, check the seasoning. Serve with a scattering of chopped parsley leaves. Serves 2May I suggest you don’t try to hurry the onions? It’s easy to fry onions quickly at a high temperature, but if you let them take their own time, they will become a soft, deep amber in colour and sticky in texture. Depending on the onions and the heat you use, expect this to take anything from 25-40 minutes.Using the sausage fat from the pan in which to cook the onions will add an extra layer of flavour.You could make this into a warming, substantial casserole by stirring in 250ml of tomato passata then baking it for 25 minutes at 200Cgas mark 6. Check the seasoning before doing so, adding a little more harissa paste as you think fit.Alternatively you could make an instant version using tinned lentils or vacuum-packed cooked lentils instead of boiling your own.

You don’t need any fancy kit, eitherThere’s been no pasta at the shops for weeks, apart from own-brand orzo (what’s that all about, by the way?). So there’s nothing else for it but to try DIY. Any beginner’s tips? The more idiot-proof, the better, please.Maggie, BradfordI’ve no idea what shoppers have against orzo, either, Maggie – the little, rice-shaped pasta (hence its alternative name, risoni) is ideal for bulking out soups, using in fake “risottos” (or orzotti), or as an alternative carby side (season generously and dress in butter or good oil, depending on what you’re serving it with). But to cut to the chase, pasta couldn’t be more basic if you tried: just flour and water or eggs. At its simplest, pasta is cucina povera (“the cooking of the poor”) in spades.Purists insist the flour has to be Italian “00”, but regular plain will also do the trick (assuming you’ve got some, that is, flour being almost as rare as pasta these days), and the process couldn’t be simpler. You don’t need any fancy kit, either, Locatelli says. “All my chefs have to know how to make it by hand, without a machine.”Put 350g flour in a bowl – “At home there’s no point in flouring an entire worktop, because you’ll only have to clean it after” – make a well in the centre and add three eggs and a small pinch of salt. “With your hand, pull the eggs through the flour until the mix comes together into a ball, and congratulations: you’ve just made five portions of pasta dough.”There’s more to it, of course, but not much. If the dough is on the dry side, don’t be tempted to pour in any liquid, Locatelli warns. “With wet hands, work it again – it’ll come together soon enough.” Knead for a few minutes – “It will be hard going, because it’s a pretty stiff dough” – then wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.When you want to cook, unwrap the dough and poke a finger into the ball – the resulting indentation should pop straight back out. “If it doesn’t, the dough’s too soft and needs more flour, but don’t worry: you’ll add a bit of that when you roll it out anyway.”On a floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll the dough from inside to out – “You need to put some effort in, and most of the force should come from your hips, not arms” – to a 90cm x 90cm square, and you’re good to cut it into your shape of choice: “Cut into neat slices, roll these up, cut again into noodles and shake out the strands.” Cook your fresh pasta in boiling salted water – “A litre for every 100g, to give it room to move” – for just 30-45 seconds for thin tagliolini and up to a minute and a half for wide pappardelle.In the south, however, water takes the place of eggs and the flour is coarse semolina, or durum, flour, which gives the pasta a firmer bite. River Cafe chef Carlotta Soper explains: “For six, pile a 400g mound of semolina on a worktop, make a well in the middle and add up to 180ml water a few tablespoons at a time. Mix with your hands until it just comes together – don’t be tempted to add more water at this stage, because it will soften as it relaxes – then knead for five to 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Cover with a clean cloth and rest for half an hour.”Use it in the Italian south’s classic pastas – ear-shaped orecchiette, canoe-shaped cavatelli, hollow ferretti: there are numerous online guides, Pasta Grannies being one of the best. “Or just create your own,” Soper says. “No one will judge you.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

In the Maori language, Mana represents a spiritual essence that almost defies translation but in everyday use it broadly applies thus: a way of holding oneself through dignity, respect, humanity and authority.It has been invaluable over the past five days because Buckingham is navigating one of the biggest disappointments of a young coaching career that, since he moved to the other side of the world after leaving Oxford United in 2014, had rarely let up. When his New Zealand Under-23 side qualified for the Olympic Games last October he expected to be leading them to Tokyo 2020 nine months later. The Covid-19 crisis put that on hold and then the dream was snatched away completely: last Thursday NZ Football confirmed it would not extend his contract beyond August – effectively making him redundant now – and that a restructuring would see the senior coach, Danny Hay, take the team to Tokyo next year.“You just have to reflect on a really enjoyable and successful time with some really memorable and historic moments,” Buckingham says. “The decision’s not going to change. My staff and I have never been ones to shout from the rooftops, whether things are going well or not.”The hurt is still raw but he has only good words to offer about his former employers, even though plenty in his orbit have expressed their views strongly. Speculation over his future had rumbled to the extent that last month a group of 24 players wrote to NZ Football requesting Buckingham and his Whanau (family) be kept together. It was not heeded and last week’s news is understood to have gone down particularly poorly among a squad whose fortunes he had turned around.That comes as little surprise on examining Buckingham’s record. He first came to global attention when New Zealand performed superbly at last year’s Under-20 World Cup in Poland, edged out on penalties by Colombia in the last 16 but outdoing any of the country’s previous showings at a Fifa event. They did it in style, bucking the image of Kiwi footballers as honest-but-dull grafters with a slick, often scintillating, attacking approach.“Before the tournament we were a team that, across the last decade, was always outpassed, outshot and outscored,” he says. “We’d won two games in 10 years. So we wanted to agree on a way of playing and showcase exactly what New Zealand players could do on the world stage. I said to them: ‘Let’s go there with belief and play the way we think we can, even if we lose all three games.’”Buckingham put together a document that looked to fuse his playing philosophy with other attributes –“a never-say-die attitude, a humbleness, no egos, a really open people who are receptive to new ideas and putting others first” – he perceived in a New Zealand player. His side lost once in open play during the tournament, Uruguay winning what was essentially a dead rubber. Honduras were beaten 5-0 and a Norway team featuring Erling Braut Haaland were defeated 2-0.The Bayern Munich midfielder Sarpreet Singh was influential and so was Liberato Cacace, a 19-year-old left-back with explosive attacking potential tipped for a move to Europe. The shootout against Colombia was, in Buckingham’s words, “devastating” because they felt so close to a push for the latter stages. But the point had been made: Kiwi footballers could get it down and play with the best.“We absolutely flipped it on its head,” he says. “The playing style was totally different. We were outpassing teams, outshooting them, and reduced opportunities on our goal by a third. Some of the football we played was a pleasure to watch.”He had been combining the under-20s role with the seniors’ assistant manager position but was then tasked with overseeing the Olympic qualification, which was earned via New Zealand’s first football gold medal at a Pacific Games. In a less troubled world that would have been the springboard to his proudest moment yet but joy can still be found in a journey he had never foreseen.“It was a bit of a jump but if I hadn’t taken it I’d have always looked back and wondered,” he says of the 12,000-mile journey from Oxford to Wellington. “I can’t describe why, but it felt right.” He had been with his local club for a decade, starting as an academy coach after his ambitions as a goalkeeper in the youth team fizzled out and becoming part of Chris Wilder’s first-team staff at the age of 29. Wilder and the long-serving Mickey Lewis were towering influences much earlier Brendan Rodgers had been one, too, during a spell playing for Reading’s youth setup.So a move to Wellington Phoenix, the only New Zealand club to play in the Australian A-League, took him far from any comfort zone. “My last game at Oxford was a 12,000 sellout at the Kassam and Dave Kitson had just risen to score the winner,” he says. “I arrived in New Zealand and the first game I went to watch was played to a capacity of 450. Getting on a plane for a few hours to every away game took some adjustment too. But it didn’t take long and the football was of a good standard.”Buckingham was recruited as Phoenix’s assistant but ended up becoming the youngest head coach in A-League history, taking over for six months in early 2017 and steering them away from the bottom of the table. A brief return to England ensued with Stoke’s Under-23s – he worked under Mark Hughes and Paul Lambert – but then NZ Football came calling with the under-20 position.“I don’t know how many experiences you get like that in a lifetime,” he says. Once the frustration and, perhaps more pertinently, the country’s lockdown have eased he will look to supplement them, although it will be a wrench to leave. In theory he could take off all by himself: Buckingham received a trial flight with an instructor for his 30th birthday five years ago and one thing led to another. Six theory exams and innumerable hours later he emerged with a pilot’s licence for craft of 24 seats or below his father visited recently and turned a shade or two of green as Buckingham flew him over the breathtaking Marlborough Sounds coastline.As hobbies go it takes some beating but he hopes a new challenge in football will be consuming him soon. Another motto from his adopted home helps him make sense of what has passed.“There’s an All Blacks saying about leaving things in a better place than when you found them,” he says. “I’d like to think that, from when we picked it up until now, it’s in a far better place in terms of results, performances and culture across both teams. “I hope they continue to go on and do what I think they can, achieving some more special things for New Zealand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4e6d3afac710bcc5dcf2752de4e9a80952b4e6/0_0_7680_4608/master/7680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d8d0fe7d4d4086797029e582bb081d 620w","title":"david squires on the premier league and project restart","story":"Our cartoonist on the plans to resume the 2019-20 Premier League season and possible options to complete it"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23aab4e9b941556cab86ab23b6dd953dabb7fc5e/0_94_3543_2125/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34527051ab172aab2cb3151d466c6891","title":"covid 19 lockdown small kind acts make a difference","story":"While we all need to stay home right now, iniduals and groups are finding ways to help their neighbours. From easing loneliness to providing food and clothes, we hear how two women and a football club are supporting their communitiesWhile thousands of us have been turning to local mutual aid groups during the pandemic, Lauren Henshaw went one step further.After asking members of her local Facebook group for Cheadle Hulme in Stockport whether there was a Covid-19 support group in the area, Henshaw – an operations director, who lives with her partner, Dave, and two-year-old daughter Beatrice – was surprised to find the answer was a resounding no. “Another woman and I realised nothing seemed to exist, so we discussed setting one up ourselves,” she says.Within days, Henshaw and fellow resident Roshini Latham had launched the Helping Hands Cheadle Hulme Facebook group, with the aim of sharing advice and matching people in need with volunteers or goods. “We bought pay-as-you-go phones and a local printing shop made leaflets which – with the postman’s help – we delivered to vulnerable people, targeting those in sheltered accommodation and the elderly,” she says. “At first, it was a volunteer-led service where people called us and Roshini and I would do things like shop for those who were isolating, pick up prescriptions and walk dogs. Then we started putting shoutouts on the Facebook group to match those in need with people who could help.”In recent weeks, the group’s focus has shifted to include not just older people and high-risk iniduals, but others in need of help too. “Now, most of that demographic have received letters from the government, local medical practices are involved in their care and food is more readily available,” she says. So, the idea of a “family bank” was born, designed to support those who wouldn’t necessarily ask for help. “So many people are falling through the gaps – you have to be registered to receive vouchers from the food bank for example, but many people aren’t yet. Then there are people like hairdressers who lost income overnight. We wanted to help people like that, and be a useful resource to the community.”The family bank works via Facebook requests, with Henshaw and Latham asking members to donate things such as children’s toys or nappies, which are then taken to a local car park for Henshaw to collect. Adhering to strict social distancing guidelines, it’s a major undertaking. “I travel alone, take antibacterial wipes and wear gloves and everybody leaves items in the centre of the car park, and when I drop donations off, I knock on the door and wave from the car at a distance,” she says. Her now-deserted office at a local industrial estate has become a temporary storage space for donations. It isn’t without its difficulties, though. “The sheer scale of donations is huge and social distancing means it’s just me alone. I haven’t had time to sift through it all – I’d like to organise it by age and gender so I can quickly grab what’s needed.”Henshaw and Latham have also enlisted the help of local businesses. “We’ve run Q\u0026ampA sessions with a local HR consultancy for people confused about employment rights or being furloughed. A local accountancy firm has offered free webinars for small business owners, and a nearby golf club has donated soup, which I distribute through local community groups to care homes, hospitals and vulnerable people.” Restaurants have also offered to cook meals, delivered by volunteers.Day-to-day, the pair have little time to stop and think about how far they’ve come. “Sometimes I feel totally overwhelmed – as admins of the Facebook group, Roshini and I are constantly monitoring requests or messages and manning volunteer phones,” she says. “We’re also liaising with people offering services, handing out leaflets, dropping off goods and applying for council grants.” And when daughter Beatrice takes her lunchtime nap, Henshaw takes the opportunity to drop off more donations, with plans already underway to set up a fundraiser to pay for a storage container, cleaning products and ingredients for meals. “I’m not getting much sleep,” she admits. “But then you take a bag of clothes to a family in need and realise why you’re doing it.”Jesse Tan has always provided a lifeline for older people and, alongside a bevy of colleagues and volunteers, she is determined that during the lockdown those same people don’t become isolated.Tan is the office manager of the Friend In Need (FIN) Community Centre in East Barnet, London, and is one of the many people around the country working on the frontline of community care during the Covid-19 crisis. “I live everyday knowing that our jobs are making a very significant difference to the people who are now locked down, desperate at home,” she says.Usually a busy day at the centre would involve welcoming visitors for anything from yoga classes, to tai chi or lunch clubs. “Our main reason for doing that is to battle loneliness, it’s a lot of prevention work because people come to build friendships and to socialise.”But the day after the nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March, that all changed. With all of their usual activities put on hold, Tan and her colleagues had to swiftly mobilise to provide support for their clients, who are on average aged between 85 and 90.They created both a Covid-19 community response group, to help with shopping, prescriptions and small DIY jobs, and a specialised mental health fitness team, to provide a check-in service over the phone. “Some had no one to collect their prescriptions or no food, or they had minor damages to their homes that made them worried or anxious,” she says. “Our calls have been very welcome as they were getting into a state of desperation, which – if not attended to – might trigger more severe problems.”Thankfully FIN has been inundated with offers of help from local people. “We have been recruiting volunteers who are placed in contact with an older person to make sure they are looked after. I can sense the spirit of community, because most of the people who have come forward to support us are people who wouldn’t usually.“I interview every new volunteer personally, and it does come across very clearly that we all have good in ourselves and it will come out at a difficult time. It’s the human in us.”As Tan explains, small acts of kindness by multiple iniduals can, together, make a huge positive impact within a community. “All of the volunteers do a small part of the work. They each carry out one or two small tasks a week, but together the team has made a very significant difference to the services we can provide. I always tell them: ‘Every little helps.’”It is not always easy to provide support though. With their usual schedule cancelled, Tan says that FIN is without a lot of its usual funding: “We normally collect a nominal charity fee from the people who attend our services, but we have lost all that. We have been left with a very small amount of funding. We are at risk of closing down in two months as the money that we’ve been saving has all been invested into the services we provide,” she says. “If people can’t give their time, it would be helpful if they consider donating.”But for those who can give their time, there really is no time like the present, with an estimated 8.8 million people over 70 who have been advised to remain at home.Tan says: “I always tell the younger people I work with: ‘All of us will grow old. One day most of us will need some support. Would you help the people who are old and vulnerable and who need us today? They contributed to this country. They need us now.’”With the football season shut down indefinitely, a team in Scotland, Stenhousemuir FC, turned their energy to the community. Within days of the lockdown being announced a hotline was set up to help local people, and a 30-strong squad of volunteers assembled in the first week to carry out tasks, such as dog walking and shopping, for those in isolation. Since then the number of volunteers has hit 80.The idea has been well received, so much so organisers have branched out to ease the strain on parents by collecting school lunches from a local high school and distributing them to children stuck indoors. On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than 130 meals.Stenhousemuir FC chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, says: “It’s clear that there will be a significant impact on football and we will no doubt be affected by this. However, there are more important matters. The coronavirus will affect thousands within our communities. The wellbeing of friends, neighbours and our community should be our top priority.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

They married months later and now live in Hollywood, FloridaCarol Natelson and Ray Bertoia had been travelling the world for years working in casinos when they met on a cruise ship in 1995. “I was working on another ship and was moved to her ship by pure chance,” he says. “As I was boarding, I spotted her outside a cabin reading a magazine. I just knew straight away that she was the one for me.”Carol, who is American, had sworn off dating, but, despite her reservations, romance blossomed quickly. “I thought he was cute and then we ended up spending lots of time together,” she says. They shared their first kiss on the island of Mayreau in the Grenadines. “We pretty much became a couple within two weeks of meeting. We had so much fun it was like being on a holiday.”They spent three months together onboard the ship, before Carol’s contract finished. “I still had six months left, but there was no way I was staying on the ship without her,” says Ray, who is originally from Scotland.Although he had been planning a career working in the cruise casino industry, Ray didn’t hesitate to leave for Carol. They disembarked in Los Angeles, before heading to Palm Springs, where she found work in a local casino. It was hard work and long hours, but they loved the lifestyle. “We were in the pool one day when I asked her to marry me,” says Ray. “We went to Las Vegas in June to get hitched. Our witnesses included Carol’s sister and a few people we’d met on the ship.” The marriage meant Ray could start working at the same casino in Palm Springs. “Our wedding happened so fast that I don’t think anyone thought we’d last,” laughs Carol. “But here we are, 25 years later.”The couple built a home for themselves in Palm Springs. They kept up their passion for travel with regular trips to Europe. “Ray learnt to sail, too,” says Carol. “One of the things that I love most about him is that he is always up for anything and he likes to do different things.”She also loves his honesty and caring nature: “He doesn’t just care about me, he cares about everyone.” Ray says they have always been on the same wavelength. “I just liked her from the first moment. She loves an adventure and she’s a fantastic cook. I think when you know, you just know.”In 2009, Ray became seriously ill due to complications from erticulitis, a digestive condition, and ended up on life support in a coma. His mother died while he was in hospital and it took him a long time to recover. For the next three months, Carol nursed him back to health. “Without her, I don’t know what I would have done,” he says.The couple had always dreamed of moving to the beach. In 2017, they took the plunge and bought a new home in Hollywood, Florida. “We have lots of family here. We can look out of the window and see the cruise ships,” says Carol. Ray found a job at the Hard Rock guitar casino when they moved.He is currently out of work due to the pandemic, but says they are “very lucky”. “We were meant to be going on a cruise to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary this year,” says Carol. “But we’ll just have to wait a bit longer.”Although Ray was 39 and Carol was 42 when they married, it was the first wedding for both of them. “Before Ray, I was always choosing the wrong guy,” says Carol. “It’s been so great to be with someone who I can always count on to be there for me.”Want to share your story?

Then, a few months in, she found out she was pregnant again – just as the coronavirus pandemic hitI stepped out of Oxford Circus tube into mid-morning crowds and cold, bright sunshine. The consultant’s words were still ringing in my ears. “Nothing.” How could the answer be nothing? This was January 2018, six months since my third miscarriage, a symptomless, rather businesslike affair, diagnosed at an early scan. The previous November, I’d undergone a series of investigations into possible reasons why I’d lost this baby and the two before it.That morning, we had gone to discuss the results at the specialist NHS clinic we’d been referred to after officially joining the one in 100 couples who lose three or more pregnancies. I had barely removed my coat before the doctor started rattling off the things I had tested negative for: antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, Factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation.“I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this is good news,” he said, while the hopeful part of me crumpled. We were not going to get a magic wand, a cure, a different-coloured pill to try next time.Now, my husband, Dan, was back at work and, for reasons I can’t really explain, I had decided to take myself shopping rather than go home after the appointment. I stood staring down the flat, grey frontages of Topshop and NikeTown and willed my feet to unstick themselves from the pavement.I ended up wandering the beauty hall of one of London’s more famous department stores. I let myself be persuaded to try a new facial, which uses “medical-grade lasers” to evaporate pollution and dead skin cells from pores to “rejuvenate” and “transform” your complexion. Upstairs in the treatment room, the form I was handed asked if I’d had any surgery in the past year. I wrote in tight, cramped letters that six months ago I had an operation to remove the remains of a pregnancy, under general anaesthetic. When I handed the clipboard back to the beautician, she didn’t mention it. I wished that she would.As I lay back and felt the hot ping of the laser dotting across my forehead, I thought how ridiculous this all was that this laser-facial is something humans have figured out how to do. How has someone, somewhere, in a lab or the boardroom of a cosmetics conglomerate, conceived of this – a solution to a problem that barely exists – and yet no one can tell me why I can’t carry a baby?There is no doctor who can reverse a miscarriage. Generally, according to medical literature, once one starts, it cannot be prevented. When I read these words for the first time, three years ago, after Googling “bleeding in early pregnancy”, a few days before what should have been our 12-week scan, I felt cheated. Cheated, because when you’re pregnant you are bombarded with instructions that are supposed to prevent this very thing. No soft cheese for you. No drinking, either. Don’t smoke, limit your caffeine intake, no cleaning out the cat’s litter tray. I had assumed, naively, that this meant we knew how to prevent miscarriage these days, that we understood why it happened and what caused it that it could be avoided if you followed the rules.You learn very quickly that the truth is more complicated. After a miscarriage, no medic asks you how much coffee you drank or if you accidentally ate any under-cooked meat. Instead you find that miscarriage is judged to be largely unavoidable. An estimated one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage, with the majority occurring before the 12-week mark. Seventy-one per cent of people who lose a pregnancy aren’t given a reason, according to a 2019 survey by the baby charity Tommy’s. You are told – repeatedly – that it’s “just bad luck”, “just one of those things”, “just nature’s way”.Just, just, just. A fatalistic shrug of a word. But this is not the whole story. “There is this myth out there that every miscarriage that occurs is because there’s some profound problem with the pregnancy, that there’s nothing that can be done,” says Arri Coomarasamy, a professor of gynaecology and reproductive medicine, and director of the UK’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research, which was set up by Tommy’s in 2016. “Science is trying to unpick that myth.”Unfortunately, the roots of this myth run deep. It’s an idea reinforced by the social convention that you shouldn’t reveal a pregnancy until after 12 weeks, once the highest risk of miscarriage has passed. It goes unchallenged thanks to age-old squeamishness and shame around women’s bodies, and our collective ineloquence on matters of grief. The bloody, untimely end of a pregnancy sits at the centre of a perfect Venn diagram of things that make us uncomfortable: sex, death and periods.There is a magical feeling that comes on after a miscarriage, I have found. A semi-delusional state that lasts for days, sometimes weeks, afterwards. After each one of mine (and there have been four now), I’ve caught myself believing I am still pregnant, despite all evidence to the contrary – the trips to A\u0026ampE, the blood, the still ultrasounds, the forms labelled “sensitive disposal of pregnancy remains”.It starts in the mornings. For a moment, stuck somewhere between sleeping and waking, I won’t have remembered, and, briefly, I’m still happy. Pregnant. When the phone rings, for a split second I’ll imagine it is the hospital calling to tell me there has been a mistake. A mix-up. They’ve got the results: I am, in fact, still pregnant. Or my husband will say, casually, over dinner, “Oh do you want to hear some good news?” and I’ll think: he’s going to tell me I’m pregnant.It is the shock, I remind myself, the trauma: it leads to disbelief. Like feeling that the loved one who has died is about to walk through the front door any minute and sit in their favourite chair. This inability to accept reality seems logical to me – inevitable, even – when there is no explanation for what has happened. The brain wants to solve problems, to make meaning.There are very few specialist miscarriage clinics in the UK. Some people end up being seen by a general gynaecologist or sent to a fertility clinic. Generally, doctors will only agree to look for a possible cause of miscarriages once you have had three in a row. Even after investigations, which in NHS centres tend to look for structural problems with the womb and for blood-clotting disorders, around half of people will never be given a reason for their losses. There aren’t even official guidelines on preventing miscarriage – only on its diagnosis and “management”.With no answers to your questions – why did it happen? Will it happen again? – you are cut adrift in a sea of recommendations from women on Mumsnet, private doctors, people offering fertility supplements, herbalists and nutritionists, and from cult best-sellers that promise to tell you how to improve the quality of your eggs. It’s been more than 40 years since embryologist Jean Purdy watched as a single-cell embryo in a petri dish ided into two, then four, then eight cells that would become the world’s first IVF baby. Humans have worked out how to intervene in order to create life in a lab, but not how to sustain it in the earliest weeks inside the body. The stage between conception and an ongoing pregnancy, visible on an ultrasound scan (at around six weeks) is sometimes referred to as the “black box” of human development.According to Prof Nick Macklon, medical director of the London Women’s Clinic and an expert in miscarriage and early pregnancy, the reason there’s been so little progress is that we’ve been asking the wrong questions. “We use the term ‘recurrent miscarriage’ as if it were a medical diagnosis, yet there isn’t one single medical cause,” he said. Some women may have a blood-clotting disorder for others, a contributing factor could be thyroid dysfunction. Many women who miscarry appear not to have an underlying health condition at all instead, their bodies seem to be less able to discern what is and isn’t a viable embryo. Yet studies of possible preventative treatments tend to recruit their subjects as if all recurrent miscarriages have the same cause.This, in Macklon’s view, is likely to explain why several large, quality trials of possible treatments to reduce the chance of miscarriage, such as heparin (a blood thinner) and aspirin, as well as the hormone progesterone, have failed to show any clear benefit, and have subsequently been dismissed by the medical community. Some of these treatments may in fact work for some women, but, Macklon says, “because of the way the study is designed, it comes out as not working overall”.A related problem lies in the mistaken assumption that most (if not all) miscarriages happen because the pregnancy was doomed to fail. In half of all miscarriages, the embryo will have a serious chromosomal abnormality that means it could never survive, but the other half are believed to be healthy embryos. Prof Siobhan Quenby, a consultant obstetrician at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, heads up a specialist clinic into recurrent miscarriage, one of four centres that form Tommy’s National Centre for Miscarriage Research. The key question, she believes, is establishing whether someone is repeatedly losing chromosomally normal or abnormal pregnancies. “Everyone from their third miscarriage onwards should have their miscarriage tissue tested genetically,” she said.Yet access to genetic testing is patchy. Not all NHS hospitals can do this kind of testing on site. If someone miscarries at home, the onus is on them to collect a clean sample of the tissue and take it to their hospital within 24 hours. This may not be something they can do – or even know about.Quenby is a celebrity in the world of recurrent miscarriage patients. Her name often crops up in the “miracle baby” stories that make the papers, with headlines such as “Baby joy for couple who lost 13 babies to miscarriages”. Her particular area of interest is how the lining of the womb behaves in early pregnancy – and how it might contribute to miscarriage. She is one of the authors of a study published in January 2020, which found that a repurposed diabetes drug, sitagliptin, could reduce the risk of miscarriage by boosting the number of stem cells in the womb lining. These cells are responsible for renewing the lining and reducing inflammation. “It’s still only a small pilot trial, but it is fantastically exciting,” Quenby told me. “It’s the first time in a long time that there’s been a potential new drug treatment.”Quenby is convinced it’s not so much the treatment options that are lacking, but the will to try them. “It’s the opposite of ‘we can’t do anything’,” she said. “There are tons of things we can try now.” Still, as a miscarriage patient, you run up against the dilemma that recurrent miscarriage is not a diagnosis in itself, so the difficulty is in establishing which treatment is most appropriate to you. Even with the help of the most motivated of doctors, there is going to be a degree of trial and error.Many people will be told, as we were, that the best treatment is no treatment – simply try again. This is what we did, only to miscarry for a fourth time. We were under the supervision of the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, yet even after that fourth loss, the prescription remained the same: just keep trying.It took us a year before we felt ready to roll the dice again. Shortly after I started researching this piece, in November, I found out I was pregnant for the fifth time.To be pregnant again after previous miscarriages is to live at the fork of two alternative lives. You try to think as little as possible about what’s going on inside your body, while, of course, thinking about it all the time. Alive or dead? Baby or miscarriage? In every possible scenario, you plan for the two outcomes. To a certain extent, you are forced to buy into both possibilities simultaneously. You cannot truly believe it will work out, but you have to proceed as though you are pregnant anyway, until a scan proves otherwise. Alive and dead. Schrödinger’s foetus.You treat yourself as your own walking research study: a sample of one. Perhaps you take a different brand of prenatal vitamin. Or you do different exercise. You do no exercise at all. You drink less caffeine. You drink no caffeine at all. You are more careful. You are less careful, because you’ve been unimpeachably careful before and look where it got you. Mostly, though, you just wait.Why hasn’t miscarriage medicine moved faster or farther? Why isn’t there more certainty about what works and what doesn’t? The first detailed depictions of a human embryo’s development, from three weeks to four months, were produced by the German anatomist Samuel Thomas Soemmerring in 1799, and the images are remarkably similar to graphics used in week-by-week pregnancy apps today. Yet a precise schema of measurements to date the stages of early pregnancy – between seven and 16 weeks – wasn’t established in modern clinical practice until 1973, with the advent of ultrasound imaging. We had put a man on the moon before we could routinely see, in real time, what was happening inside a woman’s womb.Pregnancy research, in general, is underfunded. A recent research review, published in January 2020, found that for every £1 spent on pregnancy care in the NHS, less than 1p is spent on pregnancy research. “Compared to other areas – such as infertility – miscarriage has certainly lagged behind,” said Arri Coomarasamy, who sees patients in both fields.“Miscarriage gets a bad deal,” agreed Hassan Shehata, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, who runs the Centre for Reproductive Immunology and Pregnancy, in Epsom, Surrey. “For a start, there is no specialist training,” he said. When you train as a gynaecologist, you can specialise in sub-fields such as infertility and IVF, but there is no specific speciality in miscarriage, he explained.There are also practical difficulties to conducting studies. “Pregnancy is difficult to research as, by its nature, studying it might disrupt it,” Nick Macklon told me. This means you’re often left with retrospective population data (easily skewed by multiple factors), or studying donated embryo or foetal tissue (tightly restricted for ethical reasons – and prohibited altogether by “personhood” laws in some parts of the US, which insist on burial or cremation of all pregnancy tissue).Even when human trials of treatments are feasible, there is the challenge of persuading women who are desperate to avoid another miscarriage to sign up to a study in which they might be given the placebo. As Ippokratis Sarris, a consultant in reproductive medicine and director of King’s Fertility, a private fertility clinic in London, put it: “It’s very difficult to do a proper trial – people want to take something they think might work. How do you tell them they can’t have it until there is good evidence?”Now that I was pregnant again, there was one treatment I was desperate to try. Progesterone has long been the great hope of miscarriage research. This “pro-gestation” hormone is produced in higher quantities during pregnancy by a woman’s ovaries (and, later on, by the placenta). It is essential throughout pregnancy and helps prepare the womb lining, although scientists don’t yet understand the precise mechanisms by which it does this. In May 2019, a large, multi-centre trial of progesterone, given in early pregnancy – the Prism trial – found that for women with a history of recurrent miscarriage who had started bleeding during their next pregnancy, taking progesterone made a significant difference to the live birth rate, compared with a placebo.I was prepared to argue the toss for progesterone with my doctors this time around. I knew the new evidence didn’t perfectly fit our circumstances. I wasn’t bleeding in this pregnancy, for one thing. To my surprise, the female doctor we saw at the clinic for our first appointment, in the first month of this pregnancy, agreed to prescribe it without so much as a raised eyebrow. It was not the first time I have asked about some speculative treatment, but it was the first time the clinic had agreed.As Dan and I joined the queue at the hospital pharmacy, tucked away in a grimy building in Paddington, I felt I was holding on to something bigger than the printed prescription in my hand. For the first time, we had something, after being told that there was nothing.Then less than a week later, at eight weeks pregnant, I started to bleed.There are therapies for miscarriage that have been available privately for well over a decade, yet are no closer to becoming mainstream medicine or available on the NHS. Where questions remain over the evidence, private clinics can go ahead and offer treatment anyway – something the NHS cannot do.One therapy available at a handful of private clinics – lymphocyte immunisation therapy (LIT), in which a woman is given a transfusion of white blood cells from their male partner before she becomes pregnant – has been banned in the US, outside of a research setting. Such treatments belong to a field known as reproductive immunology, and stem from work in the 80s and 90s by an American obstetrician, Alan Beer, who once summed up his theory in the following way: “Effectively, women become serial killers of their own babies.”The idea is that miscarriage can be caused by a hyper-vigilant immune system that misrecognises the symptoms of pregnancy as a threat. In these cases, treatment may involve suppressing the immune system using steroids or intralipids (essentially an emulsion of soybean oil and egg yolk, given intravenously, sometimes referred to as the “mayonnaise” or “egg-yolk” drip). Clinics charge up to £50,000 for such treatments. However, all but one of the experts I spoke to expressed scepticism about their effectiveness.Funding high-quality trials is particularly difficult when it comes to treatments that target the immune system, because, according to Quenby, in the past there has been a tendency to over-hype the results.Quenby believes our understanding of miscarriage would improve if we considered it as a public health issue, as we do stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Both of these are more common where there are high levels of social deprivation, and it’s likely the same is true of miscarriage rates, too. Though, currently, hospital trusts are not required to report the rate in their area.But like periods, female pain, the menopause and conditions such as endometriosis, which also want for good research and understanding, it’s hard not to conclude that miscarriage suffers from a lack of knowledge and interest because it happens to female bodies. What’s more, the underlying assumption tends to be that miscarriage is always down to something a woman’s body is or isn’t doing.In 2019, researchers at Imperial College London found that partners of women who have had three or more miscarriages tend to have higher levels of damage to their sperm’s DNA. The trial was small, comparing the sperm of 50 men whose partners had had miscarriages with 60 men whose partners had not. The results will need to be replicated. And before any possible treatments can be trialled, researchers need to establish what causes such DNA damage.Still, Quenby said, “The fact that we’re even looking at it is really important.” Traditionally, men and their contribution to the pregnancy have been largely left out of the picture. In the past three years, while I have been scanned and probed and pricked for multiple phials of blood, aside from completing a form outlining his basic medical history when we were referred to the recurrent-miscarriage clinic, Dan has not been required to so much as cough and say “ah”.When I discovered I was bleeding, I did a desperate search online for answers. I decided I was either having my fifth miscarriage – or, just possibly, the intermittent, brownish spotting was a side effect of the progesterone. I knew I should phone the recurrent miscarriage clinic, or my GP, or try to get an appointment for a scan at my nearest early pregnancy unit. But I couldn’t bear to. I was not ready to talk practicalities just yet, and there was no one at the clinic to call for the sake of talking. Besides, we were due to go back for a scan the following week.In the following days, the bleeding didn’t stop, but it didn’t get worse, either. Even so, I couldn’t shake the thought that, at eight weeks pregnant, this was the exact same point I had miscarried the last three times. Dan and I made our contingencies. It was early December, and we were due to move house in a few days, and we discussed how we would fit surgery around the move, if it turned out to be bad news. I bought sanitary pads and wine. We pretended we were sanguine. We pretended we knew how we would cope. “We’re pros now,” we joked. I barely slept the night before the appointment.On 4 December, my mum came with us to the hospital and managed to keep up a steady patter about her cycling, her knitting and the roadworks on the A14 while we waited. I knew she wanted to distract me. But the only words my brain had space for were the ones I was convinced I was about to hear for a fifth time: I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat. I’m so sorry there is no heartbeat.When we were finally called in for the scan, I explained to the sonographer that I was anxious. That I’d been bleeding. I tried not to look at the print on the wall of the room – the same room we were in last time – of a red heart, printed in swirly faux-brushstrokes. I tried not to think what I thought last time: how fucking inappropriate that is. A heart, for when there is no heartbeat.I lay down on the bed and unbuttoned my jeans. Dan held my hand. I was braced for the words: So sorry. So sorry. Except they didn’t come. The sonographer was telling us that everything looked fine. She turned the screen towards us, and she was pointing out the flickering heartbeat. She was telling us that I was measuring in at nine weeks and one day. The baby was moving. And I was crying.Did I dare to believe that the progesterone was actually working? The possibility loomed in my mind that our miscarriages really had been “just” bad luck all along. At least one of our losses was down to a chromosomal abnormality known as a triploidy: essentially an extra set of chromosomes. One cause of this is an egg being fertilised by two sperm at once – as random and unavoidable as that.About two weeks after it started, the bleeding waned and our clinic suggested it was time we transferred to our local hospital for antenatal care and the 12-week dating scan. (This is normally the first scan people have on the NHS, at the end of the first trimester, and it’s used to check the foetus’s health and estimate the due date.) On the one hand, this felt like an achievement – we had never made it this far before – but on the other, it meant leaving the relative security of the specialist clinic, where everyone understands why you don’t want to think further ahead than the next appointment.Feeling like fledglings pushed from the nest, we had to brave the official NHS booking-in appointment, which involved giving our medical histories to the local midwifery team and some routine screening tests. We have done this twice before, during previous pregnancies, when we knew and worried less. Two days after the second one, I bled out the tiny embryo on our bed at home. I hadn’t dared make this particular appointment since.We got our all-important appointment for the dating scan, a little over two weeks away – delayed slightly by the Christmas break. Time passed twitchily. We congratulated ourselves for not miscarrying on Christmas Eve, on Christmas Day, on Boxing Day.On 30 December, six hours before the scan, I read a note from the hospital that said you have to pay £5 for a copy of the scan photo. Fleetingly, I debated getting some cash out, but decided this would be jinxing things. At the hospital, I squeaked my name to the receptionist. We were early. This may have been our 12-week scan, but it had taken us 48 weeks of pregnancy to get here. I really wasn’t sure if I could wait another 20 minutes.I had my spiel prepared for the sonographer – “a bit anxious” … “four miscarriages”.“Thank you for telling me,” she said, as I lay down. There was the briefest of pauses. “OK, here’s your baby.”Whereas in previous pregnancies there had only been cavernous blackness on the ultrasound monitor, now there was wobbling movement the grey outline of a head and a tiny, round tummy – a waving, wondrous sea creature emerging from the dark.“They’re a wriggler,” the sonographer told us, smiling. I gripped Dan’s hand and we watched as the baby – I will try to call it a baby from now on – somersaulted for us. For the first time, we left an antenatal unit with a scan photo and stepped out into entirely new territory.On 14 March, we hit 24 weeks, which is deemed the point of “viability” – that is, when a foetus is theoretically capable of surviving outside the womb. Whatever was going to happen to us from now on, it would not be classified as a miscarriage. Keeping this baby alive would no longer be down to my body alone. Should anything happen, doctors would have to at least try to intervene. These were not comforting thoughts exactly, but they were something.Ten days later, the whole of the UK went into coronavirus lockdown. The weekend we had quietly celebrated reaching viability also turned out to be the last weekend I would see anyone but my husband or a healthcare professional for a long time.The initial days of confinement were softened by activity and preparation: batch-cooking, arranging deliveries, cancelling plans. I comforted myself by reading the official Covid-19 guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists over and over: “There is no evidence to suggest an increased risk of miscarriage … Pregnant women are still no more likely to contract coronavirus than the general population.”Slowly, though, as I watched the number of reported cases and deaths rise, marooned on the sofa at home, fear seeped under the door. Not a day has gone by, since finding out I was pregnant again, that I have not worried that my baby might die. But now, during a global pandemic, those nebulous anxieties hardened into something nameable. The shadow on the nursery wall had taken a solid shape.I woke up one night in the first week of lockdown feeling hot, my throat tight. This is it, I thought – I’ve caught it. I had barely been outside for a fortnight, though I did get my hair cut a few days before lockdown was declared. And so the taunt went round and around in my head, as I stared at the ceiling unable to sleep: your baby could die, and all for the sake of your split ends. In the rational light of day (and feeling fine), I concluded it had probably been heartburn.The world shrank. I baked bread and planted herbs. I silenced notifications and deleted social media accounts from my phone. I tracked my daily steps and counted my baby’s kicks using an app. Mixed in with the fear and stress of uncertainty, there was also a guilty kind of sadness for the things I would not get to do – things I had dreamed of for so long: a “last” holiday as a couple, showing off my bump in my first maternity dress, meeting new “mum friends” for coffee.People phoned to ask how we were coping, but it felt selfish to admit to such small sadnesses, when there were bigger worries: for my brother, who had to postpone his wedding for my cousin, who is a nurse for our four grandmothers, who all live alone. Then there were the worries of people I don’t know, but who could so easily have been us: those who have had their fertility treatment cancelled, or who will be told they have miscarried during scan appointments they have had to attend alone, in order to protect other patients and NHS staff. At the time of writing, hospitals were being advised not to offer extra scans in early pregnancy, even for people with a history of miscarriages.On 17 April, week four of lockdown, I attended an appointment for a 28-week routine growth scan by myself, while Dan, following the new rules, waited in the car. A security guard at the door checked my name off a list. The sonographer and midwife I saw wore masks and visors, while the doctor conducted my appointment from the opposite end of the consulting room. I projected my voice, like a bad stage actor: “No, no family history of diabetes”, and so on.On some days, it has felt as though the pandemic has brought my experience of pregnancy closer to the curve of normality. For so long, I had felt as if I was only playing at pregnancy, like a small girl with a cushion up her jumper. I couldn’t trust that I would get to do things other pregnant women take for granted. But then, suddenly, no one else was going to antenatal classes, throwing baby showers or browsing department stores for the perfect pram either.The temptation, when you get to where we are now, still pregnant after so many losses – and in the shadow of loss on a global scale – is to start talking about miracles. But I don’t believe in miracle babies any more. I believe we should be able to put our faith in the evidence, in knowledge of how our bodies work – or don’t work. That waiting and hoping isn’t enough. Even so, as I sit here, in my fifth pregnancy, in the third trimester, wearing my very first pair of maternity jeans, feeling our baby kick inside me, it is hard not to consider it a wonder that any of us gets to be here at all. Especially when there is still so much we don’t know.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7586d3fc4e168df6f56c026a7b657b1ce82d5bf4/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=642263ab36b629768b79468b36b68573","title":"normal people delivers best week ever for bbc three","story":"Millennials binge-watch Sally Rooney novel adaptation with 16.2m iPlayer requestsNormal People has delivered the best week ever for BBC Three as the youth drama proves a hit with millennials stuck at home during the lockdown.The television adaptation of Sally Rooney’s award-winning novel has been requested 16.2m times on BBC iPlayer since the series launched on 26 April. A quarter of those who have logged on to watch it have already viewed all 12 episodes, as millennials turn to binge-watching television to relieve the boredom.“A significant proportion of people watched all the episodes in the first 24 hours,” said Fiona Campbell, the controller of BBC Three, speaking in a virtual interview for the Edinburgh Television Festival. “The people who did that were all very young. People love bingeing.”Normal People has beaten the previous opening-week record for BBC Three held by the first series of Killing Eve, which drew 10.8m requests at its launch in 2018.Campbell said viewers had been lucky as the show was only just completed before the spread of the coronavirus halted TV and film production across the UK.“The directors just managed to get everything through post-production before the lockdown came,” she said. “For us, the Normal People figures show how well our content is still resonating. It is relevant to what people are going through at the moment.”Normal People has proved to be a breakout hit, appealing to those beyond BBC Three’s target demographic of 16- to 34-year-olds, who accounted for 5 million of the total 6.2m requests to view the show.Campbell said she believes the show would have been must-watch TV even if people were not stuck at home looking for shows to watch.“This probably would have happened irrespective,” she said. “The book had such a big fan base and it fits very much with BBC Three’s DNA. When any drama gets mega it becomes a phenomenon, everyone wants a bit of the action. People will want to watch the show even if they are in their 40s. When you have a hit you will pull in more people.”Campbell said BBC Three’s budget would “not be immune” from the cuts that the corporation is seeking to make, and the channel needed to keep its game up in the face of competition for the youth market from a variety of rivals.In March, it emerged that the corporation had held discussions about whether BBC Three should once again have a presence on traditional TV. BBC Three was taken off air in March 2016."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb47f7b629d5abfd62ebf9f6be39341fd404813/60_0_3761_2257/master/3761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d6d9c81759030deea72b764450dc29","title":"latitude refund festival ticket coronavirus","story":"The event was not cancelled until last week amid the coronavirus crisis, worrying some ticket holdersThe organisers of the Latitude festival in Suffolk (from 16–18 July) are still saying they plan to go ahead. I have a ticket (which cost £230) and was really looking forward to it, but I find this worrying in the current circumstances.We all have a duty to support the NHS by maintaining social distancing. Why does Latitude feel it is able to go ahead safely when almost all other events (football matches, Wimbledon, Edinburgh fringe, Glastonbury) have cancelled?I would prefer not to go and to get a refund for my ticket, but its website makes clear that it will not offer refunds while the event is still going ahead. That is simply wrong. To withhold money that people, in the current climate, need, and to put profit before people? Either they are going to go ahead, endanger staff and performers and force punters to make the choice of endangering their community or losing their money. Or they are not going ahead and are withholding money that ticketholders are entitled to. Please can you put pressure on them to cancel, do the right thing, and refund ticket buyers’ money? This has damaged my trust in the organisers.You contacted us in early April, at which time the Latitude website said the event was still going ahead. We got in touch with organisers Festival RepublicLive Nation at that stage, but despite numerous requests for information and clarification, nobody got back to us.However, on Monday Latitude announced that it was cancelled, saying: “We’ve been closely monitoring this unprecedented situation and it’s become clear that it’s just not possible for this year’s festival to go ahead.”You are among thousands of fans with tickets who are now being offered a refund or the chance to roll over their ticket to next year.Its agent, Ticketmaster, has been emailing all ticketholders, saying they will all be automatically refunded unless they contact it to specifically ask to transfer their ticket over to the new 2021 date. Ticketmaster says it expects all refunds to be processed by 25 May.Meanwhile, Reading and Leeds Festivals (in August) and Electric Picnic (in September) are still going ahead.

Here are some potential candidates for the role.Chief of staff to Starmer, with strong local government connections, the former campaign director of Liz Kendall’s failed leadership bid would be a popular choice among MPs and those loyal to the new leader. But he may struggle to win support from the unions, who traditionally occupy the role of general secretary.Among the favourites to replace Formby, the director of external relations at the GMB union is known as an extremely capable backroom dealer who has guided the union through tricky times with employers and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party. Her allies say she was among union officials who urged the GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, to step down last week.The Unison official and Labour’s executive director for governance, membership and party services was seen as a frontrunner for the job until a controversial leaked antisemitism report claimed she had made inappropriate comments about colleagues. She has denied any wrongdoing.A popular member of Jeremy Corbyn’s 2015 leadership campaign, she would be expected to command the support of many on the left of the party. She may suffer objections from some Starmer supporters because, like Formby, she is a Unite-backed official and is closely associated with Corbyn ally Len McCluskey.Scottish Labour’s former general secretary stood down in August after a row about the party’s position on a second independence referendum. He has been mentioned as a possible candidate by some on the right of the party.Some Labour sources have hinted that Starmer may wish to break with tradition and look for a candidate outside the party – an organiser from a third-sector body who will shake up the structures of the party without setting up their own power base."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d25c8d05349365d8d31544eee6eb38e77a7f9289/0_3_9324_5599/master/9324.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e64f21cbeb66b65723abf692c0ddd23e","title":"uk coronavirus live contact tracing app trial begins on isle of wight","story":"Deaths in Scotland rise by 44 to 1,620 trial begins for new contact-tracing app, while MPs question government scientists and new Sage papers publishedVirgin Atlantic has announced plans to cut 3,150 jobs and end its operation at Gatwick airport as the aviation industry struggles to survive the impact of the coronavirus crisis.The airline said it will reduce its workforce by more than a third and flights from Gatwick - closed due to the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic - will not restart. Some routes will be switched to Heathrow.Chief executive Shai Weiss said the carrier must take steps to “reduce our costs, preserve cash and to protect as many jobs as possible”.The airline said talks with the government about obtaining additional funding during the coronavirus lockdown “are ongoing”.Founder Sir Richard Branson recently warned the carrier will collapse unless it receives government support.Rival airline British Airways announced last week it plans to cut 12,000 jobs.NHS England has announced 366 more deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 21,750.Of the 366 new deaths announced today:- 66 occurred on 4 May - 127 occurred on 3 May- 54 occurred on 2 May - 29 occurred on 1 May The figures also show 85 of the new deaths took place in April while the remaining five deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 19 March.NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated.The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 871.A depleted workforce, problems with physical distancing and a lack of confidence among parents about children’s safety will present huge practical difficulties for schools reopening to more pupils, headteachers have warned.Ahead of reopening, the NAHT has called on the government for better guidance on physical distancing in schools, more information on how to support staff and pupils who are high risk or live with someone who is high risk and greater clarity on the science behind a return to school, as well as the availability of testing and PPE.Paul Whitehouse, the NAHT’s general secretary, said: It is clear from our survey of school leaders that the government cannot just ‘flip a switch’ and expect schools to immediately return to what we had before. The government has a lot more planning to do, which has to be collaborative with the profession in order to be successful.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: There should be no mad rush to reopen schools. It must be done with great care, and alongside a profession who feel confident about safety measures being adequate and fit for purpose.Covid-19 has claimed more than 1,000 lives in Wales, the country’s health minister, Vaughan Gething, has announced.Covid-19 has now taken over 1,000 lives in Wales. This isn’t just a number, but a sombre milestone, and a stark reminder of what we are collectively fighting for.There have now been 1,023 deaths in Wales – an increase of 26 on the previous 24 hours.During the Welsh government’s daily press conference, Gething played down a leaked report from Public Health Wales that claimed more than 30,000 tests a day could be needed to track and trace coronavirus.Gething said it was a draft plan and suggested the final daily number needed could be fewer than 9,000. Its current capacity is around 2,100 a day. Only 892 were actually carried out on Monday.The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. Here are the main points.We are looking at a range of possible easements to the social distancing measures. We are also looking at areas that need to be toughened. Once we have the scientific evidence and we have completed the review process, we will be able to set out what those are.Asked about a suggestion by Nicola Sturgeon that people in Scotland could be allowed to meet up with “small defined groups” outdoors, the spokesman said: Broadly the scientific and medical experts have been clear that there is less likelihood of transmission of this disease outdoors than indoors. That will obviously be something we are considering as part of the review.I am working as we speak to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.In the Commons Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that he could consider a proposal for a national arboretum memorial commemorating those essential workers who have lost their lives to coronavirus. He was responding to a question from the Conservative MP Heather Wheeler, who said such a memorial would be “a fitting way to commemorate the sad loss of essential workers to Covid-19”.Q: What options will be available for parents who do not want to send their children back to school?Sturgeon says she has to act in partnership with the public. She suggests there would be no point saying pupils should go back to school if parents did not have confidence in that decision.Q: The Irish government’s plan for relaxing lockdown includes specific dates. Yours doesn’t. Has the Irish taoiseach jumped the gun?Sturgeon says she does not know what advice the Irish government has had.She says the government will have to make choices.It can either continue making progress. Or else it might get to the point where lockdown measures have to be reimposed, she says.Q: Could building sites be some of the first places to come out of lockdown?Sturgeon says this is covered in the document. She will proceed at a pace that is safe.Q: How do you respond to the Scottish secretary’s criticism of your approach? (See 11.17am.)Sturgeon says she has sought to avoid partisan politics.She says both the argument that Scotland has to follow the UK exactly, and the argument that it has to do its own thing, are wrong.She will do what is right for Scotland, she says.She says a Sunday paper (the Sunday ) said schools should open at the start of June.She does not know what is right for England, she says.But she says she cannot “hand on heart” say that would be safe for Scotland.Q: The UK government has not published a document like this. Are they looking at ideas like this?Sturgeon says she thinks governments around the world are all facing the same problems, and she says she thinks they are all looking at the same possible ways out.But she says she does not know what Boris Johnson is considering.She says she wants to come out of lockdown at the right pace. If that means doing it differently from the rest of the UK, that is what it should do. If that means doing it differently in different parts of Scotland, that would be right too.Q: What advice do you have for businesses where social distancing is not possible?Sturgeon says it has to be safe.She says it might be possible to use PPE in some places where social distancing is not possible, like for hairdressers (an example cited by the questioner).She says it may not be possible to introduce these measures now. But if they do the detailed work now, then relaxing measures later might be possible.At her briefing Nicola Sturgeon is now taking questions.Q: For how long do you need sustained evidence that R is below 1 before you can lift the lockdown measures?Sturgeon says this is for the experts to advise on.She says, whenever schools get opened, there will be an impact on the R number. But if R is 0.2, that won’t take you into the danger zone. If it is 0.8, it will.She says in Denmark schools going back has led to the R number going up.Fundamentally we have got to base these decisions on what the evidence in Scotland is telling us.Q: What will the school year look like next year?Sturgeon says the paper looks at options for different year groups.There will need to be more social distancing, she says.She says surfaces will have to be cleaned properly.As for dates, she cannot say.But, as soon as evidence develops, she will make that available to the public.A total of 1,620 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 44 from 1,576 on Monday, Nicola Sturgeon announced.The first minister said 12,437 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 171 from 12,266 the day before.There were 104 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, an increase of five on yesterday, she added.There are 1,656 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 64.And since 5 March, 2,847 people who have tested positive for coronavirus have been able to leave hospital.Immediate changes to universal credit are needed ahead of a potential second wave of claims when the government’s protection schemes come to a close next month, Citizens Advice has said.Data released on Tuesday by the Department for Work and Pensions showed that 1.9 million households have made a claim for universal credit in the last two months. This equates to just under one in 10 working-age households in Great Britain.While the rate of claims has tapered in recent weeks, the charity warns its frontline advisers are preparing for a potential rise in inquiries this summer. The job retention scheme is currently due to end on 30 June, which could precipitate further job losses. Frontline advisers at Citizens Advice warn many people they support with universal credit can face hardship as a result of the five-week wait until their first payment, or risk getting into debt by taking out an advance payment.Dame Gillian Guy, the charity’s chief executive, urged the government to turn advance payments into grants to avoid putting people at risk of debt. She said:The dizzying number of universal credit claims since March is a grim reflection of just how many people have seen their income swept away by coronavirus.Decisive action from the government means hundreds of thousands of claims have been processed. The next step is to support people during the five-week wait without putting them at risk of debt problems in the future.With a potential second wave of claims looming, now is the time for the government to further strengthen the safety net by turning advance payments into grants.The Scottish government has released a second framework document setting out plans for leaving lockdown, ahead of Nicola Sturgeon’s daily media briefing and emphasising the need for the public to engage with the ideas being considered.It underlines the need for continuing caution, stating it is “almost certain” that lockdown will be extended on Thursday, the next review date for the regulations, but sets out some “illustrative examples” about how changes could be made.It is particularly cautious about schools, stating: We do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future. Indeed, we are not yet certain that they can re-open at all in the near future.Explaining that the R number – the reinfection rate of the virus – remains too high to conclude that the virus has been suppressed in Scotland, the document states:Our current best estimate is that about 26,000 people in Scotland are currently infective and R is likely to lie between 0.7 and 1.0.It adds that there is some evidence that the currently R number in Scotland is slightly above that elsewhere in the UK.The document also gives examples of some limited changes which could happen after the next review point, at the end of May, including allowing people to leave their home more often, or for longer allowing people to meet with a small number of others in a self-contained “bubble” resumption of some NHS screening services and social care support.It also says the Scottish government is in talks with businesses and trade unions about safe return to work for employees in particular sectors, with the focus on construction, manufacturing and retail as well as outdoor and rural work.

Actually, who fancies three-and-a-bit days of Proustian rushes? From 10.30am on Thursday, the BBC is replaying the full Test Match Special commentary of the second Ashes Test of 2005. It appears Sky Sports are also repeating the whole thing, though I can’t quite work out why the programme begins at 12.30pm on Thursday. Those five syllables – Edgbaston ’05 – have already sent me to several happy places and the re-listen hasn’t even started yet.This column isn’t long enough to tell the story of the whole game, and this needless sentence isn’t doing me any favours with the word count either, so let’s focus on the day life changed: 4 August 2005. The exponential drama of the match, culminating in England’s heart-stopping two-run win on the Sunday morning, sometimes obscures a first day that should never cease to astonish.England were all out for 407, their highest first-day total since the second world war. And that was from 79.2 overs the pro-rata total was 462 in a day. England’s captain Michael Vaughan later said that “the manner in which we played on that first day was the turning point of the entire series”. You can probably see it now: Marcus Trescothick pinging a stream of the sweetest cover drives, Andrew Flintoff heaving sixes all over the gaff, Kevin Pietersen bringing up his 50 with the dreamiest cuff past mid-on off Brett Lee.Even without Glenn McGrath, this was against a team with a 16-year aura and a four-man attack who had 1,083 Test wickets between them. Where did England get the effrontery?It stemmed from a chat between two blokes in a deserted field on the edge of the Leeds outer ring road. In the 10-day break after the first Test, the coach Duncan Fletcher drove up to do some technical work with Vaughan at the New Rover cricket club in Adel.When they chatted between net sessions they kept coming back to how submissive the batsmen had been, Pietersen aside, in the defeat at Lord’s. They knew they had to tell the top six to be hyper-aggressive, however scary a prospect that might be, but Fletcher also stressed the need for “total conviction” in their delivery. They even discussed the tone of voice they would use.Although there was far more to Vaughan’s captaincy genius, at its heart was a simple message: attack, except in times of trouble, when you should attack even harder, because it’s by far your best chance of stealing momentum.We know all about McGrath’s injury and the toss when Ricky Ponting made the errant decision to bowl first. “He didn’t rate the English batting and it cost him and us,” said Shane Warne in No Spin.The morning session went by in a blur of boundaries, and by lunch England were 132 for one after 27 overs. They got so far ahead of the game they were able to repel the inevitable Australia fightback and they also established an undeniable template for the rest of the series. “Marcus’s 90 was worth vastly more than many big hundreds,” said Flintoff in his autobiography Second Innings. “It announced we had come to play.”Even without McGrath, Australia had Warne to apply control and he was on inside the first hour. Yet even he went at a run a ball for most of the day. While he was defending Warne’s first three deliveries, Strauss kept thinking back to Vaughan and Fletcher’s team talk. And so he boffed the next ball back over Warne’s head for four, a symbolic statement of his and England’s intent.Two overs later, Trescothick saw Strauss’s shot and raised it with the quiet fulfilment of a 14-month fantasy. During the previous summer, Warne suggested in his newspaper column that England should drop Trescothick. “I did something I had wanted to do ever since he told the world I had been found out as a Test player,” wrote Trescothick in Coming Back to Me. “I didn’t say a word I just hit him back over his head for six. It was a completely sublime moment.”England ran with the mood for the rest of the day, with Flintoff’s exhilaratingly rustic 68, including five sixes, coming from only 62 balls. Like England, Flintoff had moments of fortune he got off the mark with a mis-hit boundary off Warne that just cleared mid-off. Had that been caught, he would have had three runs in three innings in the series. Soon after he muscled Warne down the ground for six and then, in Warne’s next over, chipped him over midwicket. He was aiming for four but timed it so well it went into the crowd. “That was when I thought: ‘I’m in here,’” he wrote in Second Innings. “And things just started happening. It all came back.”Flintoff said he “bottled it” in the first Test at Lord’s. If he could have bottled how he played at Edgbaston – seven wickets, two mighty half-centuries, nine sixes, one legendary over – he would have been one of the greatest players in history.Thinking about Edgbaston 2005 triggers so many vivid memories: having a minor breakdown while writing the ’s over-by-over coverage on that final morning, giddily hugging my colleague Sean Ingle when England took the final wicket, even going to see an outdoor screening of Donnie Darko in Kensington Gardens, London, the previous night.It evokes all those little details – irrelevant to anyone else, with meaning that is impossible to convey – that stimulate a kind of ephemeral, bittersweet time travel. I can remember so much about that long weekend: what was on my iPod, what I was wearing, where I drank, who I kissed.Most of all, I remember the desperate, dizzying and ultimately euphoric experience of watching the greatest Test match I will ever see.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

But this year’s edition was no ordinary draft (see: 19, Covid.) And Justin Rohrwasser is no ordinary kicker.When the New England Patriots selected Rohrwasser in the fifth round to replace the legendary Stephen Gostkowski, it was a shock, especially as the 23-year-old hadn’t been considered an exceptional talent in college. ESPN host Trey Wingo was even forced to admit on live TV that the Worldwide Leader in Sports had no highlights of Rohrwasser’s career.And even if there had been any B-roll of a weather-beaten Rohrwasser blasting three-pointers against Rice or Western Kentucky, none of those images could eclipse the more striking one on his left forearm – of the Roman numeral III ringed in 13 stars. To the untrained eye, the tattoo would seem little more than a marker of youth. To the keener observer, it is the unmistakable brand of the Three Percenters – a far-right paramilitary group that champions gun ownership and resists federal involvement in local matters. Formed in reaction to the 2008 election of Barack Obama, some members of the group took up arms and served as sentries for white supremacist protesters at the 2017 domestic terror attack in Charlottesville, that resulted in 28 injuries and one death.Rohrwasser, who can be clearly seen exercising his right to bare arms in official team photos, has played the naïf. He told reporters that draft night was the first time he’d heard about the significance of his tattoo, which he says he mistook for a US military symbol. He pledged to ink over it, then promised to laser it off entirely, all the while apologizing to friends and family whom he’d put in the “compromising position” of having to defend the indefensible.Those attempts at damage control might have sailed through the uprights if he hadn’t followed and “liked” so much far-right social media content. Or recommended books from Jordan Peterson and other radical traditionalists. Or previously bragged about tattooing himself with a sewing needle. Or completely ignored the much bigger tattoo just under his Three Percenters dog whistle that reads “Liberty or Death”. That’s the cry that was last heard by the anti-government protesters who’d sooner drive down to the local statehouse with their guns and exhaust in a policeman’s face than let something as trifling as global pandemic deny them the right to a haircut and a mani-pedi. Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer said the demonstrations at her state capitol – which, among other things, featured armed militia men waving Dixie flags and nooses – brought back memories of “some of the worst racism and awful parts of our history in this country.”So profound is the remorse in Rohrwasser’s heart that he apparently spent a portion of what should have been the happiest day of his life crying in his car, according to an anecdote his high-school coach shared with the Boston Globe. And, shoot, you had to feel for him. Pro football makes it so easy to summon the sympathy. When white players like Rohrwasser get whistled for their supremacist taunts, somehow, they’re the ones who are forgiven. It was true when Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins used a racial epithet to refer to black and Hiic teammates. (He blamed it on the alcohol.) It was true when Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper was caught on tape threatening to jump a security barrier at a Kenny Chesney concert and “fight every nigger here.” (He blamed it on the alcohol, too.) And it was true when Richie Incognito bullied his teammate Jonathan Martin – “a half-nigger piece of shit,” in Incognito’s estimation – out of the NFL. While Incognito resumed a career to which he’s felt very much entitled, Martin has spent the five years wrestling with his mental health. Collins, Cooper and Incognito all carried on their careers in the NFL, as will Rohrwasser. You could argue that everyone deserves a second chance. Protest about the racism inherent in the US though, and you may well find your football career is over. Or, for that matter, your basketball career.In a league where nearly two-thirds of the guys in pads are black, it stands to reason that a white player’s ethnic and cultural biases should be judged as harshly as their 40-yard dash times – you know, just to stave off any potential “locker room distractions.” But instead of a sharp examination of an actual weakness that only a white player can weaponize, we get the same ol’ soft focus on black poverty porn. We get an ESPN box on Clemson wideout Tee Higgins that ends with a bullet point about his mom fighting drug addiction for 16 years. We get another bullet in the box on Colorado receiver Laviska Shenault Jr about his mother surviving West Nile virus. We get yet another bullet in the box on Alabama cornerback Trevon Diggs about his father dying of heart failure. It’s enough to make you wonder where the bullet point about all the racist and homophobic posts Nick Bosa had liked (and subsequently deleted) before he was taken second overall in last year’s draft.For a shop run by Jimmy Pitaro – the politically averse ESPN president who has promised, on more than a few occasions, to deliver content that sticks to sports – these digressions are quite far afield indeed. What’s more, every year his network seems to come into the draft with an endless supply of these backstories. (Maybe someday one of the 12,000 draft analysts in ESPN’s employ will find the courage to weigh in.) It’s almost as if there is a stubborn social construct in America that makes it virtually impossible for black athletes to escape the traumatic beats in their humble beginnings. If ever there was a team owner in the league who might appreciate the irony at work here, it’s the Patriots’ Robert Kraft. Here, after all, is a man who not only works with Meek Mill and Jay-Z on criminal justice reform, but also gives liberally to Blue Lives causes, supports the troops and first responders and counts our law-and-order president among his closest friends. How does a guy like Kraft wind up drafting a guy like Rohrwasser? Easy. His team had a need, and his coach saw something. With a bit of laser removal and a few clutch kicks, likely, Rohrwasser will soon reduce the breathless stories about his rightward leanings to a “West Nile”-sized poverty porn bullet. The most people will remember is that he was called out for his extremist affiliations, he wept. As long as Rohrwasser plays the victim, he can never lose."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bd472ab53e296fea9be9d7a3817f26d53444ad3/365_407_2448_1469/master/2448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c477b4bcd8fd1c1f50f287b1ffb0481b","title":"london west end theatres extend coronavirus shutdown","story":"Sunday in the Park with George, starring Jake Gyllenhaal, postpones opening to 2021 as Theatreland’s closure continuesWest End theatres will remain closed until at least 28 June, the Society of London Theatres (Solt) announced on Tuesday.The organisation has been cancelling performances across the West End on a rolling basis, in line with the latest advice from the government during the Covid-19 lockdown. Those cancellations have now been extended from 31 May to 28 June. “This does not mean theatres will reopen on 29 June,” Solt stressed in its statement. “If further cancellations are necessary they will continue to be announced on a rolling basis.”The postponement of Sunday in the Park With George, starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Annaleigh Ashford, was also announced on Tuesday.

Amazon workers on Friday participated in a nationwide sick-out to, claiming the company has failed to provide enough face masks for workers, did not implement regular temperature checks it promised at warehouses, and has refused to give workers paid sick leave protest working conditions and inadequate safety protections.In a blogpost explaining his resignation, Bray called the firings of organizers at the company “chickenshit”, and said they were “designed to create a climate of fear”. In resigning, Bray has become the highest-ranking corporate employee at Amazon to publicly speak out about worker conditions.“Remaining an Amazon VP would have meant, in effect, signing off on actions I despised,” Bray, who had worked at the company for nearly six years, said. previously published Bray’s blogpost in full under Creative Commons licensing, but took it down at his request.Bray cited the experiences of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa – two user experience designers at Amazon who were fired in April after publicly denouncing the treatment of warehouse workers.Bray also cited activism among warehouse workers themselves, including actions from Courtney Bowden, Gerald Bryson, Bashir Mohammed and Chris Smalls – all of whom were fired  after organizing.A leaked memo obtained by Vice News showed how an Amazon executive denigrated Smalls, who had helped organize an action at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse, labeling him as “not smart or articulate” in a meeting with Jeff Bezos.Amazon did not respond to a request for comment, but previously cited violations of internal policies as reasons for dismissing these employees.Amazon made more than $33m per hour in the first three months of the year, according to earnings reports last week, boosted by consumers on lockdown ordering supplies to be delivered to home. The chief executive officer, Jeff Bezos, who was already the richest man in the world, has personally seen his fortune swell by $13bn this month to $145bn.“At the end of the day, the big problem isn’t the specifics of Covid-19 response,” Bray said. “It’s that Amazon treats the humans in the warehouses as fungible units of pick-and-pack potential. Only that’s not just Amazon, it’s how 21st-century capitalism is done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55f1622a0eb54040ce4ec2c7da77870f2d120e7d/0_276_5121_3073/master/5121.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=703fa1814e91baa9df95c9651da83d53","title":"the new rules of remote recruiting how to prepare for an online interview","story":"The Covid-19 lockdown has completely reshaped the way companies operate – even once restrictions are eased, many expect remote working to stay. So how can you impress a potential new boss from home?Candidates in their dressing gowns, dogs and children running about, partners in the background watching TV, or piles of dirty washing up on the kitchen counter – with 25 years in the recruitment sector, David Stone has heard it all when it comes to disastrous video interviews. “When people are working at home, because it’s your personal space, a lot of candidates completely overlook the fact that it’s still a formal first meeting,” Stone, the founder of MRL Consulting Group, says. “It’s amazing what you see going on in the background.”Holding interviews remotely – whether by phone or video – isn’t a new concept, particularly for companies that have built remote, international teams. Nor is the use of technology in the recruitment process, with an influx of artificial-intelligence tools that source and screen candidates hitting the market in recent years. There are algorithms that can analyse candidates’ tone of voice, facial expressions, and speech patterns during video pre-assessments, scoring them against an ideal profile for that role. Graduates have reportedly spent thousands of pounds learning how to beat these systems.But for many companies, still recruiting during the global Covid-19 lockdown, moving the process online can be a daunting prospect. Stone recommends all involved – recruiter and candidate – treat a remote interview like a traditional, face-to-face meeting as much as possible. “Get up, get showered, put a suit on,” he says. “Pay consideration to what can be seen on that camera behind you. Make sure you’ve got an hour’s worth of peace and quiet.” Some candidates may be more nervous appearing on video than they would be in person, he adds. “You’ve got to try and get past that. Build rapport, put them at their ease, get them talking about subjects they’re comfortable talking about so they relax.”Ellie Wilson, the co-founder and operations director of Virtalent, has run hundreds of remote interviews since launching her virtual assistant service six years ago. She’s found the recruitment process much more efficient when it’s all online. “We can go from someone submitting an assessment to having the final interview and running background checks almost within 48 hours,” she says. “I certainly don’t think you lose anything just because you can’t shake that person’s hand. I ask the same questions to a candidate that I would if they were sitting right in front of me. For me, nothing changes – I try to extract the information that I need to be assured that this is the right person for the job: can I see this person working with us, working with our clients? Do they give me confidence?”While recruiters may prefer to do the first round of remote interviews over the phone, Wilson says it is important to see the person you’re speaking to at some stage in the process. That doesn’t have to be via a bespoke HR platform – video conference tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Microsoft Teams work just as well. “If they’re going to be working remotely, you also need to be reassured they have the right set-up at home,” she adds. “I check that they have a dedicated desk area, they have an appropriate seat, and it looks free from distraction.”Candidates and interviewers alike should switch on all equipment 15 minutes beforehand, think about getting the lighting and camera angle right, test microphones, and put phones and any push notifications on silent, says flexible working consultant and executive coach Marilyn Devonish. “When speaking, look directly into the camera so the other person feels like you’re looking at them,” she adds, rather than getting distracted by your own image on the screen (Zoom has a “hide myself” option, which can help). She recommends interviewees also do a practice run-through with friends or family: “Think about making sure your personality comes out. So if you’re going for a job that needs a motivated self-starter, that’s what you’ve got to be when you’re on camera.” Candidates interviewed by video also have the luxury of being able to use printouts of the job description and any other reference notes without the interviewer’s knowledge.Recruiters should be mindful of including more visual and linguistic cues than they might use in person to show they’re following what the candidate is saying. “Things like saying ‘right’, ‘OK’, ‘great’,” Devonish adds. “If the sound drops, this is not the time to be scared or too polite – say: ‘I’m sorry, I missed that.’ Both sides need to make sure they can hear each other clearly.” A clear explanation for how the process will work should also be provided in good time, including the necessary passwords and access links. And always have a plan B. “Let them have a telephone number so that if the technology fails, they can call you. And if something does go wrong, watch how the candidate reacts – if they completely lose their head, that actually tells you a little bit about how they operate under pressure.”Stone believes the Covid-19 lockdown could mark a seismic shift in the way companies operate going forward. “This episode has proven that you don’t have to stop in your entirety when something like this does occur,” he says. “We’ve got some clients who are interviewing remotely and then onboarding new recruits by video too, just having a laptop delivered to their house. They’re hiring highly skilled people having never met them in their lives.”If you are currently recruiting for your schools please contact us by going to recruiters.the and if you are seeking a new role at a school please visit our jobsite"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec43ccfd4e8f655532094d4b8c0429660d64565/499_0_4273_2564/master/4273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=324e7c942e9dd33430f02c5e92313fad","title":"helsinki huge vr virtual reality gig potential virtual tourism","story":"Finland’s biggest online event – a gig by JVG – was ‘attended’ by over half a million but Helsinki has even more ambitious plans to become the virtual capital of the worldAccording to Finland’s National Police Board, this year’s Vappu Eve (the festive night before May Day, when the country traditionally enjoys public fun and frolics) was “exceptionally peaceful”. Citizens largely respected calls to stay at home. And yet … I found myself at a gig in Helsinki’s Senate Square with almost 150,000 other people. I was dressed as a giant pineapple called Temperamenttinen Satuilija (Temperamental Fabulist!), and was tossing champagne at Finnish rap duo JVG as they performed live on a stage, in front of the city’s neoclassical cathedral. Just another day in lockdown.Though it happened in real time, the event was held in the virtual world. While Temperamenttinen – my avatar – was bopping in the Nordic twilight, I was at home, at my computer, cat on knee, finger on mouse, sending gestures and fizz-bottle emojis to the duo, who could see the feedback as they performed. I can’t say it had the buzz of being at a “proper” concert. And JVG weren’t my personal jam. But, technically, it was impressive. Without the requirement of a VR headset, I was watching humans, performing in real time, in front of an interactive audience, within a world of meticulously rendered make believe.Virtual Helsinki – launched in late 2018 – is the physical capital’s digital twin. It was built using 3D modelling from open data (supplied by the city), as well as drawings and images. It allows users to experience key landmarks as they choose, and it claims to be one of the world’s most realistic VR experiences.The platform is part of the city’s bid to become the virtual capital of the world. “We are embedding digital innovation into all of the city’s activities. Simply, digitalisation builds better cities – it means personalised services and more choice,” says Laura Aalto, CEO of Helsinki Marketing. Helsinki is a good test-bed for VR: big enough to enable the development and trial of significant innovations, small enough for it to be feasible.The Covid-19 lockdown has spurred such a trial. “We realised we could use Virtual Helsinki for the local community, by inviting citizens to participate in a virtual celebration with one of the country’s most popular artists,” says Aalto. Development of Virtual Helsinki’s gig platform was accelerated, including new features, such as bringing in audience avatars. Zoan, the Helsinki-based VR studio behind the project, squeezed half a year’s work into five weeks. It worked.The live show was watched on 460,000 computers. With a conservative estimate of 1.5 viewers per computer, that is almost 700,000 people – Finland’s biggest online event. Of those, 149,403 attended by creating avatars, though the camera largely focused on the band and, with only 500 avatars visible at a time, you’d have been lucky to pick yourself out on screen – even dressed as a pineapple.The gig was a success, but what does it – and virtual tourism more widely – mean for the future of travel? Helsinki is seeking to be a pioneer of sustainable tourism, and allowing people to visit without racking up carbon emissions certainly aids that.“The travel industry needs to reinvent itself and I hope this encourages other destinations to experience with digital platforms,” says Mikko Rusama, chief digital officer at City of Helsinki. “Some are suspicious and think no technology can replace a real visit – which in a way is true. But VR can bring about new experiences that are impossible in real cities.”Virtual Helsinki plans to develop its content – art exhibitions, shopping experiences, “re-lived” historical events – and to make it all multi-user. “Multiplayer functions enable visitors to become social in virtual cities,” says Rusama. “That will have a big impact on people’s interest to explore places virtually.”But, when we’re permitted to move again, will the city have made actually visiting it feel unnecessary? “No, the idea is to offer visitors an alternative way of experiencing the city in addition to travelling here,” says Aalto.Right now, destinations across the world are brainstorming ways to create virtual content to keep visitors interested while travel is off-limits. There are 360-degree tours: we can scan the mountains of Switzerland, the skyscrapers of Dubai or the Great Barrier Reef  and 3D modelling allows us to take tours of Egypt’s ancient wonders that offer such clarity we can see chisel marks on the walls. Also, festivals and events have moved online: the Grand Ole Opry, Nashville’s weekly country music concert, which hasn’t missed a show in its 95-year history, is now streaming every Saturday night.And we can expect more, believes Dr Timothy Jung, founder and director of the Creative AR \u0026amp VR Hub at Manchester politan University. “The role of VR will increase,” he says. “The tourism industry may need to consider hybrid experiences – a combination of real and virtual – in the future. And, after this forced isolation, people will be more open for virtual experience as an alternative way of socialising and enjoying life. It might be accepted as the new normal within tourism.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7536f669d19af51bc5bc9f36880785e12f9b0407/118_372_4018_2411/master/4018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9aa0fe6748b4a86c61f42b4faa6a4aa5","title":"eurovision must go on the fans and stars who wont let coronavirus stop the party","story":"The 2020 song contest may be cancelled, but diehard devotees, plucky hopefuls and prosthetic-wearing Finns are boom-bang-a-banging on regardless For the casual viewer, the Eurovision Song Contest happens on one ridiculous, strobe-lit night in May, accompanied by a bottle of fizz and the sarcastic commentary of Graham Norton. But for the true devotee, the contest starts months earlier, with hot rumours and endless speculation about leaked demos, not to mention the precision tracking of every country’s heats and hopefuls.For those diehards, the cancellation of the show due to coronavirus was devastating. Not only is the grand final in Rotterdam not taking place for the first time in 65 years, the same fate has also befallen the many pre-parties planned around Europe. At these jubilant jamborees, 2020 acts would have performed their entries, while forgotten Scandinavian contestants from the early 90s would trigger hysteria just by strolling on stage, and a single spin of Katrina and the Waves’ 1997 winner would spark uncontrollable sobbing.However, the show isn’t quite over. The artists who were meant to compete have been fighting back through the power of live-streams and video-conferencing. Daði Freyr was one of the favourites to win, his song Think About Things having gone viral before it had even been selected by Iceland. The video shook social media, thanks in no small part to the band’s quirky dance routine and pixel-art jumpers, as well as their strange keyboard-saxophone instruments and smouldering looks to camera and wind machines. Everyone from Russell Crowe to James Corden tweeted their approval. No nul points here.Unable to take Think About Things to Rotterdam, Freyr has turned to YouTube to give a bit of Eurovision back to the fans, performing covers of such contest classics as Lipstick by everybody’s favourite bequiffed Irish twins Jedward. In another life, Freyr’s quarantine versions of bygone offerings could have won the contest.“The Eurovision community has been a big part of why my song has done so well,” he says. “I wanted to do something for them. Also, I’ve been doing video covers for five years. It’s not just something that has come with quarantine – although I’m close to 40,000 subscribers now. I didn’t have 1,000 before.” Freyr is planning a live-streamed concert this month ahead of the contest, although the details have yet to be ironed out. “I’m just going to press the button and see what happens.”Victoria from Bulgaria was another hot favourite with Tears Getting Sober, a touching ballad about mental health. She has been performing online concerts as replacement therapy for the pre-party addicts, as well as participating in Eurovision At Home. In this series, streamed on the official Eurovision YouTube channel, past stars perform in isolation, letting fans pick which songs they sing.The results have been tremendous. A Sámi joiker (a traditional singer) from the Norwegian band KEiiNO has rapped along to Hatrið Mun Sigra, an industrial track from pro-BDSM, anti-capitalist art collective Hatari, from Iceland. And on 16 May, meant to be the date of the final, the show’s organisers will air Eurovision: Europe Shine a Light, a celebration of the 41 fallen songs, that promises to include a crowdsourced karaoke version of the 1980 winner, Johnny Logan’s sax-and-flute scorcher What’s Another Year.What of this year’s UK entry James Newman, who was hoping to break the UK’s string of bad luck with his love songode to deep sea ing My Last Breath? Well, Newman will also be getting his time in the spotlight, speaking to Graham Norton on the night of what would have been the final and tracking his scuppered road to Rotterdam for a BBC documentary, as well as singing a Eurovision classic from the vaults for the home concerts.“I was gutted about the cancellation,” he says. “I knew it was coming, but when I found out, I had to pull over and have a little minute. But I’m still really busy – it’s just all from my front room on video calls.”Even outside the official channels, Eurovision is alive and well thanks to thousands of fans who are using the past to fill in the gaps of the present. These stalwarts, as well as former contestants, have been sync-watching vintage contests, casting their own votes afresh in an online poll and trending on Twitter with #EurovisionAgain.They’ve rewatched Lordi – the prosthetic-wearing Finnish rock monsters – triumph at Athens 2006. They’ve picked over UK hopefuls Scooch floundering at Helsinki 2007. And they’ve swayed along to Malena Ernman, mother of Greta Thunberg, representing Sweden with a dance-opera-bop at Moscow 2009.“One of the things I really love about Eurovision is chatting about it as it happens on Twitter,” says writer and Eurovision Again mastermind Rob Holley. “When you rewatch a year, there’s always stuff you’ve forgotten, so to go back and tweet along is really fun.“When we did it that first week, it started trending alongside Ant and Dec and Doctor Who. I wasn’t hugely surprised, because the Eurovision fandom is hugely enthusiastic and the group viewing experience is unique. But over the past few weeks, it’s just got more and more popular.”The European Broadcasting Union, the body behind the contest, got in touch – not, as Holley thought, to issue a cease and desist, but to help. They ensured that high-quality streams of contests were available on YouTube, and shared a countdown on their official channel to 8pm, so that Eurovision fans around the world could all sync their viewing for the ultimate simulcast experience. “I can’t imagine the Olympics producing all of this content to replace the competition,” says Holley.That celebration of the 41 fallen songs will be the last that will be heard of them, contest-wise anyway: the rules state that they can’t be reused for 2021. This is why the decision to completely cancel the show has so ided fans: many believe that remote performances could have been possible, allowing the songs to be aired and their singers to do battle.Although Freyr seemed on track for a high-placing finish, he backs the rules. “I wouldn’t want to bring Think About Things back next year. The song would be more than a year old, and the performance as well.” Nor does he like the remote option. “If the contestants aren’t all singing on the same stage, with the same lighting, cameras and production values, then there’s not really a competition.”Fans may have been robbed of a chance to witness Europe’s best, bravest and most bonkers musicians battle for glory this year, but the cancellation won’t stop them from celebrating Eurovision – they’re just going to celebrate, say, the 2006 contest instead. After Lordi’s historic victory that year, Finland broke the world karaoke record, when about 80,000 people gathered in Helsinki’s Market Square to sing Hard Rock Hallelujah. Changed days indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba412cacb6e452ce5b7501d9963b8a6b69fcdbbb/947_218_3798_2279/master/3798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=118000853d4ab2b2e49371687891dfc0","title":"forget friends the 25 greatest overlooked sitcoms from lovesick to younger comedy tv shows lockdown","story":"All 4A six-part Channel 4 comedy from 2009 about talent agents, the show starred Stephen Mangan, a pre-stratospheric Sharon Horgan, and features Anthony Head’s greatest ever performance. It made central London look as beautiful as it has ever looked. And yet it came and went in the space of a single series.BBC iPlayerMy theory is that many more people know about Better Things than have actually seen it, thanks in part to the participation and then very sudden non-participation of its co-creator Louis CK. It’s an unvarnished, autobiographical-seeming sitcom about a orced woman (Pamela Adlon) who single-handedly raises three children. It is raw, touching and incredibly funny. And yet the most remarkable thing about is Celia Imrie’s exceptional performance as Adlon’s mother.NetflixNobody watched Lovesick when it was first on Channel 4, because back then it was called Scrotal Recall. Which is a shame, because Tom Edge’s comedy was a thing of true beauty. A man learns that he has a sexually transmitted disease and has to revisit his past partners to let them know. The episodes are told in flashback, as we watch the birth and death of each inidual relationship. Lovesick isn’t just funny it is also exquisitely constructed and beautifully performed.All 4Mark O’Sullivan and Miles Chapman’s mockumentary began as something deceptively broad: a Stath Lets Flats-ish look at two working-class builder brothers from Stevenage. But in this final form, it is much more nuanced and multi-layered than the premise would suggest. It slowly blossoms into a sweet, beautifully observed meditation on fraternal friendship. Sky ComedyA sitcom about a disgraced Harvard professor forced to teach high school biology. Dripping with talent, it is consistently riotously funny and as structurally solid as any sitcom can be. In a parallel universe, this show is as big as 30 Rock. BBC iPlayerThis might be the funniest thing on terrestrial television at the moment. Spencer Jones plays a down-on-his-luck chancer who drifts in and out of absurd situations. A self-playing piano lets him fake his way into a job as a restaurant pianist. A painting and decorating job ends with a visit from the armed response unit. Imagine a much sillier Only Fools and Horses and you’re on the right track.Sky ComedyA show set in heaven that aired at the same time as The Good Place was never going to come out on top. And yet Miracle Workers, in which Daniel Radcliffe plays a celestial worker trying to save Earth from destruction at the hands of an absentee God (played by Steve Buscemi), is arguably just as smart and clever as its more successful peer. The first season is a self-contained story with a finite ending. It will take you a day to watch from start to finish, and your life will be better for it.Sky Comedy The only true post-Friends success an excruciating faux reality show starring Lisa Kudrow as Valerie Cherish, a former sitcom actor bidding for a second shot at success. The Comeback is so funny that you will ache and so unflinching that you will chew the flesh from your hands. AmazonThe third season of Future Man came out a month ago, and nobody seemed to notice. Co-created by Howard Overman (who co-created Merlin and last year’s War of the Worlds), this swing-for-the-fences silly comedy sci-fi is about a gamer who becomes a time-travelling superhero. There is a huge chance that you will forget about Future Man the second it finishes, but at least you will have a good time while it’s on.AmazonMichaela Watkins should be one of the most famous performers in the world and Casual is proof of that. Playing a therapist who moves in with her brother after leaving her husband, Watkins is funny, sexy, sad and raw all at once. It’s a revelatory performance that never quite got the response it deserved. All 4George Jeffrie and Bert Tyler-Moore’s 2010 sitcom is as undemanding as it gets. Rafe Spall plays a slappable man-baby who struggles with the most basic of tasks and interactions, and the whole thing has a running sports-style commentary, which gets old within seconds. But underneath all that, you will find a solid hangout comedy about a bunch of friends in their first flush of adulthood. Now TVDarren Star’s comedy-drama has an excellent premise a 40-year-old single mother must pretend to be 26 to make a success of herself in the publishing industry. What’s more impressive, though, is that Younger is somehow able to sustain this premise for a full series. It is lightweight and disposable, but never manages to fall prey to any of the obstacles that litter its path. For something that could have fallen flat at the first obstacle, it is tremendously well done.All 4A Phoebe Waller-Bridge sitcom about twentysomething property s. The characters are broader than you would expect, and the tone is slightly too twee. Nevertheless, if you squint, you can tell who wrote it. There are moments where the characters sidle up to big realisations and then back away, trapped in the words unsaid. But also there are ukuleles, so tread carefully.All 4One of the best comedies of recent years, The Other Two is as bright and confident as a sitcom can be. Drew Tarver and Heléne Yorke play siblings who get left behind when their 13-year-old brother is catapulted to Justin Bieber levels of fame. Vicious and warm, it might actually be perfect.Now TVLike Casual, Mrs Fletcher isn’t exactly laugh out loud. It is a quiet, slow, contemplative Transparent-esque sadcom about a middle-aged woman rediscovering her sexuality after her son leaves for college. However, it is held together by a towering performance by Kathryn Hahn. With her ability to flit between dozens of directly conflicting emotions in a single take – not to mention the smart, compassionate script by The Leftovers’ Tom Perrotta – Mrs Fletcher is absolutely worth your time.NetflixIf there was a God, he would show us that he loved us by bringing back Great News. Written by 30 Rock’s Tracey Wigfield, it is a frantic workplace comedy that takes place at a cable news show. The hook is that a middle-aged woman takes a job in a newsroom alongside her high-achieving daughter, but really this is just a relentless screwball of a show. The script is perfect. The cast is perfect. Every episode fires on cylinders you didn’t know even existed. YouTubeAdam Pally and Sam Richardson play two members of a rapper’s posse who find themselves trying to adapt to civilian life after the rapper dies. It is an aggressively stupid show, and you will love it with all your heart.Now TVA period comedy starring Don Cheadle, set in the weeks leading up to the stock market crash of 1987, this is both a whirlwind comedy of vulgar excesses and a tightly plotted murder mystery. Almost nobody watches it, which is a crying shame.AmazonArguably the most underrated comedy of recent years, Andy Daly’s Review is a thing of total perfection. Daly plays Forrest MacNeil, a critic who reviews life experiences chosen for him by the public. It starts sensibly enough, with a review of stealing and cocaine addiction. And then comes orce, at which point things really begin to spiral. The genius of Review is how each new indignity piles on top of the last, causing MacNeil to quickly lose his grasp on reality. This show is a masterpiece. If you only watch one thing on this list, make it this.AmazonThis is one of those shows that only really qualifies as a comedy because it is half an hour long. There is a suicide attempt very early on in the series, which is used to vault to a place that deals with heavy issues like depression, homophobia and cancer. Reviews came bookended with the numbers of crisis support services. It is not something to sling on to unwind after a hard day. But if you’re in the mood, it is also so warm and brave that you will want to clutch it to your chest.Now TVIn a way, it is a good thing that Detroiters died, because it freed Tim Robinson to make the untouchable sketch show I Think You Should Leave. But in another sense, it is unbearably sad, because Detroiters was magnificent. Robinson and Sam Richardson play best-friend advertising partners with no money and barely any IQ. Each episode is basically just an excuse to watch Robinson and Richardson tool around like bozos. It will for ever be missed.Apple TV+Like The Morning Show, this is another excellent series that nobody watched because Apple overestimated its own popularity and will go down as a hidden gem. Rob McElhenney from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia plays the charismatic lead developer at a videogame studio, and we watch as the effects of his obnoxious whims ripple out across his overloaded workforce. Mythic Quest could have simply become another tired old workplace comedy, but there is real artistry to be found here. A highlight is the episode A Dark Quiet Death, which is basically a sweet little indie movie that exists completely outside the universe of the rest of the show.NetflixThis list has been short on Japanese-language sitcoms, and even shorter on sitcoms about pudding-obsessed men who sneak out of work during the day to eat desserts that make them hallucinate and then ejaculate. Reader, Kantaro: The Sweet Tooth Salaryman is that show. It isn’t consistently funny, but it is consistently weird, which is just as good.Now TVDanny McBride is a weird one. On film, where he often appears as a side character in Seth Rogen-y comedies, he comes across as crude and obnoxious. And yet the TV shows he creates are exquisite. Eastbound \u0026amp Down was a classic, Vice Principals was extremely good and The Righteous Gemstones might be his best work yet. As a sitcom about dysfunctional televangelists, it is necessarily satirical, but at the same time it is crude and bleak and – sometimes – surprisingly big-hearted. McBride has stated that he wants this to run for years. Hopefully he will get his chance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe9b05fe0a96309fd82d7b3d79911af09b16be13/0_297_4492_2697/master/4492.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a48e6a0020a6adf31cd559d7297381","title":"joe biden tara reade senate records reject request","story":"Senate secretary said legal counsel advised that ‘the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information’The US Senate has rejected a request from Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, to search for and release any records of a 1993 complaint against him from an aide who has accused him of sexual assault.The former vice-president gave his first TV interview on the matter on Friday, flatly denying former aide Tara Reade’s allegation that when he was a senator from Delaware he pushed her against a wall and assaulted her.Biden also wrote to Julie Adams, the secretary of the Senate, requesting that she locate and make public any paper trail relating to a complaint Reade says she made to the Senate personnel office.But on Monday the secretary said the Senate legal counsel had reviewed relevant laws and, based on strict confidentiality requirements, advised that “the secretary has no discretion to disclose any such information as requested in Vice-President Biden’s letter of 1 May”.The Biden campaign responded with three questions: can the Senate disclose whether the records exist is there anyone to whom the records could be lawfully disclosed and can the Senate release any procedures used by the office that would have overseen a sexual harassment complaint in the 1990s.The decision left more questions than answers and was seized on by Republicans. Steve Guest, rapid response director for the Republican National Committee, wrote in an email: “Joe Biden’s attempt to offer faux transparency ground to a screeching halt this morning.”Guest accused Biden of sending the media on “a wild goose chase” to look for records in the National Archives, which said it does not hold them, and then to the Senate.The existence or otherwise of records at the Senate, National Archives and University of Delaware has become a vital piece of the jigsaw in the allegation against Biden, who said on Friday that he was not aware of any complaint on file.Biden told MSNBC: “This is an open book. There’s nothing for me to hide.”Reade has said she filed a complaint at the time of the alleged incident and was subsequently fired. But she said last week that the complaint did not explicitly accuse Biden of sexual assault.“I remember talking about him wanting me to serve drinks because he liked my legs and thought I was pretty and it made me uncomfortable,” she told the Associated Press. “I know that I was too scared to write about the sexual assault.”Reade subsequently tweeted that the AP report was “false”. She also said she had been threatened.Reade was among eight women who alleged last year that Biden made them feel uncomfortable with unwanted touching or displays of affection. He apologised, then appeared to make light of the matter.After Biden effectively secured the Democratic nomination to face Donald Trump in November, Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in his Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, alleged Biden pinned her against a wall in the basement of a Capitol Hill office, reached under her skirt and pushed his fingers inside her.Reade, 56, said she was reluctant to share details of the assault during initial conversations with reporters more than a year ago because she was still coming to terms with the incident and feared a backlash. Two of her associates said last week she had conversations with them that corroborated aspects of her allegation.Numerous Democratic leaders and figures in the #MeToo movement have shown solidarity with Biden. Republicans have accused them of hypocrisy, arguing they have been zealous in believing women who have accused Trump and other conservatives of assault.The president has faced multiple accusations of assault and harassment, all of which he denies.Maureen Dowd, a columnist at the New York Times, observed: “Democrats always set standards that come back and bite them. They have created a cage of their own making.”But Trump himself, trailing Biden in numerous polls, has been uncharacteristically hesitant to weigh in. In an interview with the conservative radio host Dan Bongino, he said if the accusations were false, Biden should deny them.“Just go out and fight it, it’s one of those things,” Trump advised. “I’ve been a total victim of this nonsense, false accusations.”Biden wrote the Violence Against Women Act as a senator but came under fire for his handling of Anita Hill’s 1991 Senate testimony against now supreme court justice Clarence Thomas.He said last Friday on MSNBC: “Believing women means taking the woman’s claim seriously when she steps forward, and then vet it, look into it. That’s true in this case as well …“But in the end, the truth is what matters, and in this case, the truth is the claims are false.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f68f997ed6712c336e6eb4d7adf3391cbd997dc/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c78f2aaf6091d19c276d74aaf0dac20","title":"co living coronavirus roommates starcity","story":"With Bay Area rent soaring, Mario Koran moved to Starcity, where kitchens and bathrooms are shared. Is socially distancing possible in ‘a college dorm for grown-ups’?I’m living with 48 roommates in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Co-living makes physical distancing all but impossible: we touch the same door handles, awkwardly navigate shared spaces and binge-watch Tiger King in the same TV lounges.The fear of coronavirus hasn’t so far driven me to move out or reignite a grueling apartment search. But neither can I say with authority just how safe co-living is in the middle of an outbreak.Before I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in September, I was aware of the region’s reputation for towering costs of living. But I wasn’t prepared for the grinding hustle to find affordable housing. Even renting a room in someone else’s apartment felt more like a job interview with prospective roommates.I bounced between temporary rooms until I could find a more permanent place, living out of a suitcase, storing frozen meals in strangers’ refrigerators. At one point, I was willing to take a partitioned-off section of a living room someone was renting as a bedroom for $1,500. No dice: the tenants decided to “move in another direction” in terms of a roommate.When I found Starcity – a tech-enabled real estate company that’s part of a new generation of co-living spaces – it was, by all measures, an improvement to my living situation. It looks and feels a lot like a college dorm for grown-ups. The building is clean and well-lit, with a low-key, budget-trendy style. Beds and kitchen appliances are new. Showers don’t inexplicably scald or give me frostbite. Laundry, soap and internet fees are included in rent. My room is my own space. The flexible lease was a major selling point and the price was right, too.My apartment in Oakland rents for $1,250 a month – about $600 less than the median rent for a studio in Oakland and about $1,000 less than a typical one-bedroom.This is how, at the age of 38, I effectively returned to my freshman year of college. I made a new group of pals and began to settle in. Then came the coronavirus.In spite of the pandemic, new residents continue to move into Starcity. But I’ve also seen a good number of residents leaving with packed bags – some for good, others planning to wait out the worst of the pandemic with friends or family.A couple of weeks ago, one woman sent me a message asking if I had any intel on penalties for breaking the lease. She couldn’t do this co-living situation, she wrote, especially during Covid-19. Days later, she was gone.Roshan Ramankutty, a software engineer in the sales department of Square who has become a friend, decided the best option for him is living with nearby family members.“For me, it came down to: if the worst case scenario was to happen, how would I best be able to support and be supported? And that’s ultimately with my family,” he said.Jon Dishotksy, Starcity’s 36-year-old CEO and co-founder, says the company has received only a half-dozen lease cancellations since the lockdowns started. One Starcity staff member tested positive for Covid-19, he said, but so far there have been no known outbreaks in Starcity communities.In a co-living environment, refrigerator handles, faucets and elevator buttons are all common touch-points. Even a trip to the kitchen to fetch a cup of coffee could put you in close proximity to your neighbors.So is it actually possible to protect yourself from an outbreak in a place like Starcity?Paula Cannon, professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at University of Southern California’s Keck School of Medicine, agrees that co-living certainly isn’t ideal during a pandemic but says there are ways to minimize risk.“If I was living there as a virologist, I would be your very annoying neighbor sticking leaflets under people’s doors that say ‘here’s what Starcity is doing’ and ‘here’s what we can do as neighbors’,” she said.Cannon suggests, for example, creating a schedule for the kitchen, so residents can space out meal times and reduce exposure to others. Cleaning and disinfecting the kitchen before and after each use would help. So would making your bedroom your castle and keeping to it as much as possible.That, she says, requires residents to buy into a shared contract and agree to do their part to protect themselves and their neighbors.Health guidance aside, sheltering in place at Starcity hasn’t always been convenient. Under lockdown, mail and packages to our building have stopped.Dishotsky explains that receiving packages has been a challenge across Starcity communities, partly because they repurpose underused hotels or commercial spaces that lack places to store packages.Weekdays see my neighbors waiting by its front door for deliveries for hours on end. Many packages have been rerouted, delayed, or stopped altogether. Hand-drawn notes decorate our front door, reminding delivery drivers: “THIS IS A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS.” It’s a small issue compared with the grim toll coronavirus has taken elsewhere. But it’s a valid concern at a time when deliveries remain one of the few ways for people to buy essentials.So far, there’s been no groundswell among residents to adopt a kitchen schedule like the one Cannon suggests, but that could change should someone in the building get sick.While some residents have been keeping more to their rooms – emerging only occasionally, and with increasing edginess, to use the kitchen or shower – others see roommates as members of a traditional household and have given up trying to maintain six feet of separation.Even Cannon recognizes that self-isolating at all times could defeat the fundamental benefit of group quarantine.“Part of the draw of places like this is the sense of community, which helps people who have become near-suicidal because of isolation,” she says.Indeed, having roommates has been instrumental in helping me beat back the madness that encroaches after days of solitude.We’ve passed time in childish and inane ways, spending nights eating Pringles and playing video games. We put on Pink Floyd albums and shot hoops at the downstairs basketball court until the wee hours of the morning. Suppertime sees a small troop of us rallying behind João, a Brazilian restaurant manager who’s been laid off during the outbreak but continues to cook for those of us dug into the trenches of co-living alongside him.And lockdown has shown me – as a hopeless introvert – how much I’ve come to appreciate having, even need, others around.Dishotsky, who helped launch Starcity in 2016, grew up just south of San Francisco, in Silicon Valley’s Palo Alto. His father, a Stanford professor, rented out rooms to students, rooting his son in co-living early on.After a decade in commercial real estate, Dishotsky said he wanted to create something to help meet the Bay Area’s most pressing need: a healthy stock of affordable housing options.“I saw a way to make a dent in the housing supply and keep it affordable so a city doesn’t push out its restaurant servers, postal workers, journalists – the ones who make up the backbone and underlying culture of our cities,” Dishotsky explains.Over the years, Starcity has been featured in the New York Times, SF Curbed and CityLab, with stories exploring the degree to which a concept that once seemed absurd – a group of adults living together like college students – could be an answer to the lack of affordable housing.It’s also been subject to skepticism. In 2016 a local news outlet described Starcity as taking advantage of a loophole in city regulations that allows developers to buy single-room occupancy hotels, or SROs, flip them, then raise rents from, say, $450 to $2,100 a month at one San Francisco location.“That was before we understood the full impact of converting SROs,” Dishotsky says of the criticism, adding that Starcity allowed previous residents at that address to continue to rent at the prices they paid before the building was renovated.Since then, Dishotsky has been outspoken on the issue of displacement, writing in 2018 op-ed that he refuses to purchase or manage buildings that previously served low-income residents and calling on other developers to do the same.Dishotsky believes Starcity’s model is resilient enough to outlast the pandemic, even as companies like WeWork, which offers shared office spaces, looks to scale back communal areas moving forward.He sees co-living as a model of the future – one that will one day be embraced not just by single adults but whole families attracted to communal living and shared childcare.As CEO, Dishotsky’s optimism isn’t surprising. But Cannon, as a virologist, backs him up.“I would be wary of attributing too much to how much coronavirus will change society. We have very short memories. Once we get a vaccine, and we will, people will re-emerge and things will go, mostly, back to normal,” Cannon says.The silver lining, Cannon said, could be getting residents to embrace the social contract of taking precautions to look out for their neighbors’ health as well as their own.“These things build trust and a sense of community,” she says. “It’s the underlying human experiences that will ultimately get us through this moment.”As for me, I don’t plan to stay at Starcity forever. The lockdown will eventually pass and one day I might even find a place to settle down. Until then, I’m leaning into the moment – even if that looks a lot like it did when I was when I was 19 years old."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29a962165ef5955d285bfbf5fdbf940c1a419763/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f7c93636ee2798e144dac5fc5d5b563","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We want to hear from those who attended mega-events such as Cheltenham Festival and the Stereophonics concerts in CardiffWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead during the week beginning 9 March.Those events include: the Cheltenham Festival, the Liverpool v Atletico Madrid Champions League tie, and the Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff.Do you believe that you were infected by coronavirus by attending one of these events?You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

We wouldn’t usually see this phenomenon in influenza or community-acquired pneumonia. It’s very much more profound and an example of very abnormal physiology going on before our eyes.”Dr Mike Charlesworth, an anaesthetist at Wythenshawe hospital in Manchester, said that while other lung conditions could cause severe hypoxia, these patients would normally appear extremely ill. “With pneumonia or a pulmonary embolism they wouldn’t be sat up in bed talking to you,” he said. “We just don’t understand it. We don’t know if it’s causing organ damage that we’re not able to detect. We don’t understand if the body’s compensating.”Charlesworth had a personal experience of the issue while suffering from Covid-19 in March. After becoming unwell with a cough and fever, he spent 48 hours in bed, during which there were signs he was hypoxic, he said. “I was sending very strange messages on my phone. I was essentially delirious. Looking back I probably should’ve come into hospital. I’m pretty sure my oxygen levels were low. My wife commented that my lips were very dusky. But I was probably hypoxic and my brain probably wasn’t working very well.”He recovered after a few days in bed, but he and others are conscious that not all cases have positive outcomes.However, it is not the fall in oxygen levels itself that leaves people feeling breathless. Instead, the body senses the rising levels of carbon dioxide that typically occur simultaneously as the lungs are unable to clear gas as efficiently. But in some Covid-19 patients, this response does not appear to be kicking in.“I don’t think any of us expect that what we’re seeing can be explained by one process,” said Bannard-Smith.Swelling and inflammation in the lungs is likely to make it difficult for oxygen to enter the bloodstream. There is also emerging evidence that Covid-19 can cause blood clotting. The vessels in the lungs that collect oxygen and transfer it into the wider bloodstream are so tiny they can become blocked with the smallest of clots.Several clinical trials are looking at whether blood thinners could prevent or treat complications of Covid-19, including respiratory problems and low blood oxygen.Some have suggested that, since people are often oblivious to falling oxygen levels, those with Covid-19 symptoms or a positive test result should be given pulse oximeters, a simple device that clips on to the finger and can be used to detect oxygen levels at home. However, as yet there is no evidence that early detection of hypoxia would help avoid severe outcomes and Charlesworth said the practicalities would be difficult.

But they are nervous about getting involved in an escalating international situation.On Sunday Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said: “I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.”No evidence was offered by Pompeo to back up his assertion but information has been circulating over the last month in the UK, US and Australia aimed at raising questions about the high security Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has long specialised in researching coronaviruses in horseshoe bats.Stories have suggested that workers in the lab may not have always used full protective equipment, and that in one instance a bat urinated on a researcher who did not subsequently become ill.But there is nothing to indicate a leak from the lab could have caused the pandemic, sources say.Claims are even made that the virus was genetically engineered in Wuhan, although there is both scientific and intelligence agency agreement that there is no evidence for this.American scientists who have worked with the Wuhan Institute add its safety standards are comparable to Western equivalents – and the prevailing theory is that the virus was passed onto humans via one of the country’s live animal markets.Australia’s Daily  – a Sydney tabloid owned by Rupert Murdoch – has been focusing on the Wuhan lab for several days, culminating in a weekend report which cited a 15-page dossier compiled, it said, by “concerned Western governments” amid an investigation by British and other members of the Five Eyes intelligence agencies.Intelligence sources in Australia were quick to say they believed it was based on open source, public domain material. One told the  they believed the information that appeared in the News Corp title was most likely to have originally come from the US: “My instinct is that it was a tool for building a counter-narrative and applying pressure to China. So it’s the intent behind it that’s most important. So possibly open source leads with a classification slapped on it.”Downing Street said that the UK did not comment on intelligence matters – although British sources also said they did not recognise the dossier as based on classified information provided by the country’s spy agencies.Downing Street said it would not comment on intelligence matters, but a No 10 spokesman said: “Clearly there are questions that need to be answered about the origin and spread of the virus, not least so we can ensure we are better prepared for future global pandemics.”Neil O’Brien, a Conservative MP and secretary of the China Research Group, said that Beijing could help fend off speculation with greater transparency: “If their government were less secretive and authoritarian they would cooperate more and so potentially put to bed wilder ideas about the origins of the virus.”Last week, the New York Times reported that White House officials, led by deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger, a former China reporter with the Wall Street Journal, pressed the US agencies to gather information that could support any lab theory.A report in the Washington Post two weeks later highlighted a leak of US diplomatic cables from 2018, claiming that a site visit showed the WIV had insufficient appropriately trained technicians for the high security work.The lab itself says it is distressed by talk of leaks. Scientific American re-edited an interview with the virologist Shi Zhengli last week to address “the tenuous suggestion” of the lab theory, and noted the “genetic sequence” of Sars-CoV-2, the scholarly term for coronavirus, “does not match any her lab had previously studied”.Charles Parton, a former foreign office official and senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said: “People pushing these sort of lines are doing everybody a disservice.“It will inevitably prompt a Chinese reaction at a time when there is a need for a proper scientific understanding of its causes, and, in the longer term, to work together to stop pandemics happening again.’’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0e95b2e4c48c1dd3cb4a3afb78c62dbbb58081/0_77_2343_1406/master/2343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a77d5f4d6e71dff3c053642283fc0e33","title":"rapid coronavirus test site data was not shared with scottish and welsh ministers","story":"Results from rapid testing sites was restricted until last week because of data disclosure rulesHealth ministers in Scotland were barred from seeing thousands of coronavirus results from rapid testing sites for weeks because of data restrictions imposed by the UK government.The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) began setting up rapid testing centres across England and Scotland to test hospital staff and key workers for Covid-19 in early April, but Scottish ministers were given the data for the first time late last month.The DHSC, which hired the accountancy firm Deloitte to run the programme, decided at first to only give the results to inidual patients, to the irritation of ministers in Scotland.Initially only patients in hospital could get tests in the UK. Then testing was expanded to NHS staff and care home staff. Now up to 10 million essential workers and their families who are showing symptoms of coronavirus can apply for a test via a government website.\u0026nbspThe list of essential workers is the same as the one used to allow the\u0026nbspchildren of key workers\u0026nbspto carry on going to school during the lockdown. In addition to health and social care staff, the list includes teachers, judges, some lawyers, religious staff, and journalists providing public service broadcasting.Also included are local civil servants, police, armed service personnel, fire and rescue service staff, immigration officers and prison and probation staff. Some private-sector staff also qualify including vets, those in food production, essential financial services and information technology, as well as those working in the oil, gas, electricity and water sectors.As a result, none of the positive test results detected in Scotland were included in their daily updates on Covid-19 cases in April, and could not be factored into those governments’ planning for the pandemic.The DHSC’s very narrowly drawn data disclosure policies meant those results could not be shared with the Scottish government, or the hospitals those staff worked for, even if it was anonymised. English hospitals reported that some test results were late, lost or given to the wrong workers.UK government ministers and health officials had described the rapid testing centres as a key part of the “five pillars” strategy to confront the pandemic, and said their output was essential in meeting Matt Hancock’s pledge on 2 April to carry out 100,000 tests per day by the end of April.When the Edinburgh test centre opened on 16 April, Lord Bethell, a UK government health minister, said it was a “national effort to boost testing capacity for coronavirus to protect the vulnerable, support our NHS, and ultimately save lives”.The DHSC said overall results from those tests were included in UK totals released by the UK government each day. However, it refused to disclose publicly how many tests it carried out at rapid testing centres in different parts of the UK.In Scotland, the UK government had opened rapid testing centres at Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Inverness airports before they changed the data protection rules.The Glasgow site started testing nearly three weeks before the rules were amended. The devolved Holyrood government was told each day how many tests had been carried out at the rapid testing centres, but not what those tests uncovered.The Scottish government said knowing how many key workers were positive was “essential in order to report meaningfully on the testing conducted at these facilities”. Officials in Edinburgh said they were told the DHSC had decided only the patient would know whether their results were negative or positive.In contrast, the Scottish government had been giving the UK government a full daily breakdown of all its testing programme data from March onwards, including the number of tests, the number of people tested, the results of those tests and its total testing capacity.The Welsh government said it had decided to opt out of the UK government’s rapid testing centre programmebecause it realised there would be a problem with data-sharing and patient confidentiality.Instead of allowing the DHSC to set up testing centres, Public Health Wales began work to introduce its own drive-through sites to ensure test results were available to the Welsh NHS and ministers. The first site was set up at Cardiff City’s football stadium on 7 April.A Welsh government spokesman said: “We identified issues around the storage of data from testing centres at the outset and worked with UK government and Deloitte to ensure data was retained by NHS Wales.”The UK and Scottish governments told the  they finally resolved the data protection issue in late April.Holyrood said that even though rapid testing centre results are now being shared by the DHSC, the figures released by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, every lunchtime still do not include the UK government data because they need to check it is accurate and robust.While the figures are now being used within the Scottish NHS, the data may not yet be publicly available until early May – a month after the first Scottish centre opened.A DHSC spokesman confirmed there had been a delay. He said: “We have made clear from the outset we would be happy to provide this data to NHS National Services Scotland and have now done so after being provided with the necessary legal and technical assurances from Scotland.“A new digital system has now been built which will allow the fast flowing of this data to the relevant public health authorities, including in Scotland, going forwards.”• This article was amended on 5 May 2020. Due to a misunderstanding that arose from communication with official Welsh government sources, an earlier version stated in the text and headline that Wales, like Scotland, had experienced problems in obtaining Covid-19 testing data from DHSC. In fact, as the text now makes clear, the Welsh government set up its own testing centres to head off such data access issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus 5 may at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:New figures place the UK’s coronavirus death toll higher than that of any other European country. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said 29,648 deaths with Covid-19 mentioned on death certificates had occurred in England by 27 April. Reuters calculates that, when figures from the rest of the UK are accounted for, the total stands at 32,313.Afghanistan has announced its highest one-day rise of new Covid-19 infections. A total of 330 new Covid-19 patients were confirmed overnight in the war-torn country. Five deaths have also been recorded, pushing the total number of infections to 3,224 and the death toll to 95.Uganda began to loosen one of Africa’s strictest anti-coronavirus lockdowns on Tuesday after the president, Yoweri Museveni, declared the infection “tamed”. Museveni announced in a televised address late on Monday: “We have somehow tamed the virus. It is high time we … start slowly and carefully to open up, but without undoing our achievements.”Spain has reported 185 new deaths in 24 hours, meaning that the overall toll has risen to 25,613 from 25,428.

Others were returning home or moving across the continent in search of work when frontiers were closed in March.They include large numbers of Chadian students stranded in Cameroon, about 1,800 Nigerien workers stuck in remote goldmining areas in Burkina Faso, and more than 1,000 migrants from Mali and Senegal trapped in Mauritania.In east Africa, about 2,300 migrants are stranded in Djibouti after being abandoned by traffickers. Most were hoping to cross the Red Sea to Yemen and then reach Saudi Arabia and the Arabian peninsula, mainly in search of work.The migrants are among the marginalised communities who are most vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. Many are women and children.Africa has more than 46,000 reported cases of the disease and 1,800 deaths. However, the numbers are believed to be a fraction of the real toll so far, highlighting a recent warning from the World Health Organization that the continent of 1.3 billion people could become the next centre of the global outbreak.Mohamed Ali Nageye, a 29-year-old Somali migrant, said he had been stuck in Djibouti since February. “We waited for the traffickers but they said nobody can travel because of coronavirus. I am very worried that I cannot continue my journey and also I cannot return to Somalia now because Covid-19 is also bad there.”Abdulfatah Hassan Gedi, 25, said he and the other migrants in Djibouti were caught between “a rock and a hard place”.“The government is harsh on the migrants, we can’t work and it’s very expensive here now … But worse is if we contract the virus here. We don’t have anybody to support us. If we try to continue our journey, there is no boat,” Gedi said.The pandemic has pushed some migrants to take enormous risks on the final stages of their journeys to reach Europe.There are reports that smugglers are taking migrants in unseaworthy boats on long journeys across the Red Sea to remote beaches in Yemen. On the northern borders of Niger, migrants are forced to use remote paths in the desert, travelling in small groups to avoid detection, to cross from Niger into Libya or Algeria.The combination of increased risk and demands for bigger bribes from corrupt border guards have pushed transportation fees for the trip across the Red Sea to US$1,000 (£800), up from US$500 before the pandemic, while the fee to cross the desert frontier from Niger into Libya has gone from about $80 to as much as $300.Large groups of migrants often find themselves abandoned in perilous situations. In late March, 256 migrants from across west Africa were left by smugglers in the desert at the border with Libya, a day’s walk from the nearest settlement.Along with hundreds forcibly expelled from Algeria between mid-march and mid-April, they are now stranded in transit centres and across Niger. Some are living in harsh conditions in makeshift quarantine camps in Agadez, the town in the north of Niger that has historically been a hub for migrants. They include children, pregnant women and older people.A voluntary humanitarian return scheme run by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is their only option to go back home.The IOM is trying to negotiate a humanitarian corridor across closed borders to allow repatriation as tensions at the transit centres rise.“We know there is a crisis out there, but it pains me to know we were supposed to leave last week we even had our tickets,” said Mohamed, 24, from Chad. “I really hope the situation changes soon. I want to go home.”Barbara Rijks, the head of mission for IOM in Niger, said the organisation was stretched to the limit, as new funds had yet to come in.“While waiting for the thousands of migrants in our transit centres to return to their countries of origin, new migrants are continuing to arrive from neighbouring countries or having been abandoned by their smugglers in the desert, adding to the number of people in need of assistance,” she said.There are 2,462 migrants in Niger in transit centres, quarantine sites and other types of accommodation.“In addition, all of the transit centres have already reached maximum capacity and we can no longer admit new migrants, despite the high demand,” Rijks said.There are also concerns about thousands of people stuck in poor conditions in overcrowded accommodation or in detention facilities in Libya, where they are vulnerable to Covid-19.About 1,500 people are stuck in the unstable country’s official detention centres suffering poor hygiene conditions, limited food and constant risk of abuse, rape, forced labor and trafficking.“Covid is exacerbating increasingly negative trends seen over five years,” said Hara Caracostas, a Tunis-based migration specialist for the Danish Refugee Council. “It is not just that movement has stopped but work has stopped too. So people cannot continue their journey but they can’t survive where they are.”For those without reliable accommodation, curfews imposed to fight Covid-19 mean constant fear of arrest and extortion by unscrupulous security forces.Migrants have also been caught by border closures in southern and central Africa. One group has been blocked from entering Uganda from the Democratic Republic of Congo.Every year, thousands also travel down the continent’s east coast to reach the relatively developed economy of South Africa – passed down a chain of smugglers who use rickety boats, overcrowded lorries and dangerous paths through the remote bush areas to cross frontiers.The dangers of the route – and the numbers using it – were highlighted when 64 people believed to be from Ethiopia were found dead in a container attached to a truck in Mozambique in March.Police and immigration authorities stopped the truck en route from Malawi in the province of Tete, bordered by Malawi on one side and Zimbabwe on the other. The driver told local media that he had been offered money in Malawi to take the migrants into Mozambique.Others have been blocked heading back to Zimbabwe. In Musina, the last town in South Africa before the frontier, hundreds of people have gathered in increasingly harsh conditions.“People are really suffering. They don’t have enough to eat. They are stuck. There is no movement and the police are patrolling,” said Jacob Matakanye, of the Musina Legal Advice Centre.The migrants in Musina are not eligible for the emergency relief grants recently announced by South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, and lack food. Matakanye appealed for help from international NGOs and governments.The xenophobia prompted by the pandemic has caused real problems for migrants everywhere, legal and illegal.Last month, the captain and six crew members of a Panama-registered bulk carrier pleaded guilty to charges of attempted murder in Cape Town, after allegedly forcing two Tanzanian stowaways overboard because they feared they had Covid-19.The men drifted in a home-made raft off the KwaZulu-Natal north coast before eventually washing up on a beach.Additional reporting by Abdalle Ahmed Mumin in Mogadishu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2fcd8f7e23087b38901d83023883bcfd2453d17/0_275_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29c10ec5cfea8a3557a22e54b265dab1","title":"coronavirus uncertainty how to prepare","story":"There will be no quick return to our lives after the pandemic. Some realistic pessimism might help us curb disappointment Time is humanity’s ultimate organizing principle, and many, myself included, have longed for a neat finale during this pandemic – a day we can patiently wait for, when this will all be over.At first, political authorities in many countries spoke of societal lockdown in terms of weeks – a challenge, yes, but a manageable one there are even those who treated it as a rather novel adventure. More recently, as understanding of the pandemic develops, that metric is shifting, discouragingly, to months – even years.Last week, Chris Whitty, the UK chief medical adviser, said that social distancing would have to continue at least all year, while Canadians have been told to expect limits on travel and gatherings for likely around a year and a half. Donald Trump recently admitted that America’s pandemic guidelines – which he initially claimed would be null by Easter – would likely remain into summer and, enigmatically, “beyond that”. Some regions are considering how to gradually reopen their economies, yet the experiences of Asian countries where infections surged as restrictions eased serve as cautionary tales. Dozens of experts have attested there will be no quick return to our previous lives.Now that we are no longer at the beginning of this pandemic but in the seemingly interminable middle, the more relevant question to ask is not “when will this end?” but “how can we cope with this dragging on?”Looking forward to plans can be psychologically beneficial, keeping us engaged in life. But given the current circumstances, “Either focus on the right here, right now, the immediate days and weeks – we all have a lot of control over the next week,” says Aldao, “Or try focusing on the more distant future – maybe a year or more from now.”Aldao’s advice dovetails with the wisdom of the US navy vice admiral James Stockdale. Stockdale, who spent seven years as a prisoner of the Vietnam war, is renowned for his articulation of what is now called “Stockdale’s paradox,” a “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” ethos captured by his quote: “You must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end … with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality.”An advocate of steely pragmatism in the face of adversity, Stockdale observed that his cellmates – “the optimists” who believed they would be free by Christmas, then, when that didn’t happen, by Easter, and so on – became demoralized and “died of a broken heart”.While our circumstances are distinctly unlike Stockdale’s, his wisdom regarding how to cope with uncertainty still resonates: we cannot afford to spend the entirety of this pandemic expecting normalcy to manifest just around the bend – doing so only compounds our pain.So, aside from cancelling our plans and relinquishing faith in a clear-cut end date, how do we really confront the most brutal facts of our current reality, without getting bogged down by the sheer glumness of it all? It may sound counter-intuitive, but according to the psychologist and self-awareness researcher Dr Tasha Eurich, we can start by planning ahead for worst-case scenarios.“We’re not going to be able to control the uncontrollable, but we can make a contingency plan,” says Eurich. “For example: if we’re all locked up in our houses until there’s a vaccine, the question should be, ‘Using everything I can control, how can I create a livable new reality, knowing that it won’t last forever, but knowing that my plan for a four-week isolation is going to be a lot different than for one that’s 12 months long?’”You don’t want to get stuck ruminating on your fears, “but you have to figure out what could happen so you can control what you can, without it becoming a source of constant sadness,” she says. Make a plan for tangible circumstances, like what you will do if you or someone you live with gets sick, if your business cannot reopen, if a natural disaster occurs while you’re in lockdown – then put it aside and try not to worry about it.You can also shift your focus inward. “Imagine you’re sitting with your grandkids in 50 years and they ask you, ‘What was it like during the pandemic?’” says Eurich. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the things in my life I want to use this as an opportunity to get clearer on, and how can I reframe my situation with that longer lens to figure out what I should be focused on right now?’”If you find yourself worrying, Eurich suggests assessing your wellbeing in the moment – and appreciating what you do have. “To me, hope for the future can be replaced by hope for the present – gratitude,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2a9bda14b6754c6bea03f9a8b7cca7cfcffbb4/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=220\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853c14cd36c559eda676952606fb3c65 220w","title":"uk discriminating against eu citizens say meps","story":"Many citizens with ‘pre-settled status’ are finding it hard to get benefits on offer to UK nationals, MEPs sayBritain has been accused by MEPs led by an ally of the French president, Emmanuel Macron, of discriminating against EU nationals left destitute in the UK as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.Those who have not lived in the country for more than five years are said to be facing “significant obstacles” or having their claims outright rejected when seeking the benefits on offer to UK nationals.There are around 1.2 million people with so-called pre-settled status under which they do not have an automatic right to welfare payments.Many of them have lost their jobs during the crisis but have found they are unable to rely on the welfare safety net at at time of unprecedented economic strife.The issue has sparked concern in EU member states, with the German newspaper Die Welt reporting of a couple, showing signs of a fever, left unable to pay their rent after losing their jobs working in warehouses in Somerset. The article was reported by the newspaper under the headline: “This month we have a total of £200 to survive on.”Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.A cross-party group of MEPs led by Nathalie Loiseau MEP, a former European affairs minister in Macron’s government, has said the British government is breaching the spirit of the withdrawal agreement under which the government said it would not discriminate against nationals from the EU member states.In a letter to the cabinet minister Michael Gove, who sits on a joint EU-UK committee implementing the Brexit deal, the MEPs write: “While the country is facing the severe consequences of the global pandemic of Covid-19, EU citizens under pre-settled status are facing significant obstacles to access social benefits such as universal credit.“This would constitute a violation of the good implementation of the withdrawal agreement … As you are well aware, the number of EU citizens under a pre-settled status cannot be considered as marginal, as it exceeds a million iniduals.“Among them, those who may be in need of assistance during the current crisis are facing undue discrimination at the worst possible moment.”The government changed the law in 2019 with the result that unless EU nationals have lived in the UK for five years and gained so-called settled status they do not automatically meet the test of being habitually resident.Without such status, claimants need to prove that they are economically active through providing pay slips or accounts to successfully claim social assistance.The changes were made as part of the government’s stated intention to protect the social security system from people coming to live off benefits rather than to work.The law has been recently tested in the high court, which ruled that while there was discrimination it was justified and not unlawful.Luke Piper, a lawyer with the campaign group the3million, said the government should rethink the implications of the policy given the unfolding crisis.He said: “On the one hand, the UK is saying to EU citizens, you can live here, you are valued here, but we are not going to make it easy for you to access your benefits.“But this is not just a political issue, it is a legal issue. But nobody wants to go down a legal route and it should just be sorted out politically.”The MEPs further complain in their letter about the Home Office’s announcement last month that a resolution centre responsible for processing EU settlement applications would “no longer answer inbound telephone calls, and the postal route for submitting identity evidence is currently suspended, thus delaying the applications”.EU nationals have until June next year to successfully apply for settled or pre-settled status in order to be able to stay and work in the country.The MEPs write: “We, as elected representatives of EU member states, wouldn’t accept that British nationals would be discriminated against in the EU in the current situation. Similarly, European citizens living in the UK shouldn’t be unduly deprived of their rights.”A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “The government is protecting the rights of EU citizens resident in the UK.“By applying to the EU settlement scheme, EU citizens living in the UK will be able to work, study and access benefits and services in the UK on at least the same basis as they do now.“Whether someone has pre-settled status or settled status, this means they have been accepted through the scheme and have secured their rights in UK law.”Udo, a self-employed IT consultant who asked for his real name not to be used, moved to the UK with his wife and child last year from Cyprus.The family has pre-settled status but have been unable to claim universal credit.

He told Sky News that such issues were “under discussion” between trade unions and the business department but stopped short of setting out how those employers who disobey the rules would be punished.The government has been worried that people may be too concerned about coronavirus to want to leave the lockdown, while trade unions warned on Monday that many could refuse to go back to work or stage walk-outs if they felt unsafe.Starmer argued that national standards would give “a degree of confidence”, telling ITV’s GMB: “The point that trade unions have raised is safety at work and there was a consultation document the government put out last weekend which was pretty vague, and it needs strengthening.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:“That’s why one of the principles I’ve set out today is a national safety standard. I think people will want to know: if I’m going back to work, is it a safe environment, what’s being done about social distancing, what are the hand-washing facilities, if I need protective equipment am I going to get it? It’s that degree of reassurance.”Starmer also raised concerns about the emphasis that Hancock is placing on getting people to download an app to help trace the contacts of those confirmed as infected with coronavirus. The mission to test, track and trace those with coronavirus is part of the plan for new outbreaks of coronavirus to be suppressed, as the UK exits the lockdown.The government launched a pilot scheme on Monday to trial the app in the Isle of Wight, where people are being urged to download it.Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 201415, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Hancock said the app was “a very, very positive step in terms of us all being able to get some of our liberty back”.He added: “By having the test, track and test in place we can release more of the social distancing measures and, as I said, the more people who download it ... the more effective it will be and the more we can control the spread of the virus, and that’s why it’s so important to do this.”The app has been criticised by some campaigners for jeopardising people’s privacy. Amnesty International has raised concerns that “the government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects”.However, Hancock dismissed that charge as “completely wrong.” Asked why, he said: “Firstly because the data is stored on your phone until you need to get in contact with the NHS in order to get a test and secondly because the purposes of this are purely and simply to control the spread of the virus, which is really important.“Thirdly because we’ve all had to give up significant infringements on our liberty, for instance with the social distancing measures and the lockdown, and we want to release those, and this approach will help us to release them ... I can reassure you that it’s completely untrue.”The health secretary was also questioned about whether new rules for social distancing and staying at home would be different for the over-70s and people with underlying health conditions.Many Tory MPs are urging the government not to treat people differently based on age, with Sir Graham Brady, leader of the backbench 1922 Committee, urging government to let older people take their own decisions about the risks.Hancock would not give any assurances that older people would be treated in the same way as younger people when the lockdown is eased, although he said that had been the approach so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6523d9bcf64cf93420cf0e95c8b5ee7d082c6b4f/782_474_2274_1365/master/2274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9014c1a3835ded27dabcb6560ee0e54e","title":"social distance cinema drive in theatres boom coronavirus in pictures","story":"With the widespread closures of cinemas as part of measures to stem the spread of Covid-19, drive-in movie theatres around the world, where social distancing is guaranteed, have been enjoying new-found popularity"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245401.1588679091!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dry april resulted in drought conditions in areas says met %C3%A9ireann","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSt Patrick’s Park, Dublin, over the bank holiday weekend. Photograph Nick BradshawThe In its monthly climate statement, the national forecaster said that rainfall was below average in every part of the country while temperature and sunshine levels were above average countrywide.It was cool and cloudy at times, especially at the start of the month, but there were also “numerous” warm, sunny days, especially during the mid-week periods.It was warmest in the western half of the country during these periods, as the winds were mostly from the east off a cool Irish Sea. The weather broke on April 29th as a complex area of low pressure brought active weather fronts across the country from the south and southwest, followed by showers on the 30th.Rainfall totals across the country were below the long-term average (LTA), with the lowest levels of rain being recorded in the east and northwest of the country.Cork Airport had the highest rainfall total for the month with 72.3 mm, which is 95 per cent of its LTA, while Dublin airport had the lowest total with 12.8 mm, or 24 per cent of its LTA.The highest daily rainfall was recorded at both Sherkin Island and Athenry on Wednesday 29th of April, when 25.6 mm of rain fell.Temperatures were high across the board, with Newport, Co Mayo having the highest average temperature for the month at 11 degrees, 2 degrees higher than its LTA.Dublin airport recorded the lowest average temperature for the month at 8.5 degrees, which was still 0.4 degrees higher than its normal average.The highest air temperature was also recorded at Newport Co Mayo when it reached 21.6 degrees on Friday April 24th, while the lowest air temperature was recorded at Mount Dillon, Co Roscommon, when it reached -3.2 degrees on Tuesday April 14th.Malin Head in Co Donegal had the highest monthly total of sunshine with 204.4 hours, meaning a daily average of 6.81 hours per day.On Monday April 20th, Malin Head recorded a total of 13.9 hours of sunshine, the highest daily total recorded over the month.Cork Airport had the lowest total with 162.4 hours of sunshine over the month, meaning an average of 5.47 hours of sun per day.The monthly climate report comes after Irish Water last week urged the public not to water gardens or to undertake “cosmetic” washing of cars and patios.The utility said the water system was experiencing a “period of high demand” following an “unseasonably dry month”.“The balance between the amount of water we can sustainably produce and the demand on water required in some regions, including the Greater Dublin Area, is an ongoing challenge,” Irish Water said."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Otherwise all restrictions will remain in place.Mr Varadkar said that on May 18th, should progress in containing the virus continue in the intervening two weeks, then the restrictions will be eased in a series of five stages, three weeks apart. “Our plan is to re-open the country in a slow, staged, phased way,” Mr Varadkar said.On May 18th, some retail outlets such as garden centres and DIY centres will be allowed open, some outdoor sports will be allowed and small groups of family and friends will be permitted to meet in the open. Construction and outdoor work will restart.In later phases, other businesses will be allowed reopen. Schools and colleges will reopen in September and October at the beginning of the next academic year. Cafes and restaurants will reopen on June 29th and pubs will reopen on August 10th.However, Mr Varadkar warned that the easing of the restrictions will depend on there being no “second wave” of the virus which could overwhelm health services.“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” he said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.“In any scenario, at least until we have a vaccine or effective treatment, there will be a long-term need for physical distancing, good hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene, regular cleaning and for people to stay at home and isolate if they are sick.”Micheál Martin said he agreed with the cautious advice of the public health officials but called for clarity about the leaving certificate.Mary Lou McDonald said that it was “essential” to have a roadmap for the reopening of Ireland, and said that the testing capacity needed to be improved to allow for the lockdown to be lifted.In a televised address on Friday, Mr Varadkar said thousands of lives have been saved “because of the sacrifices and choice you have made”.“When we come through this, we will come together as a nation and grieve for everyone who has died over the course of this emergency,” he said.But he warned that the phases of reopening the country may have to be reversed back a step, if the rate of the infection increases significantly as the lockdown is eased.“We need two more weeks of tight restrictions,” Mr Varadkar said, so the virus does not have a chance to make a “comeback”.The curve has been flattened but “we have not yet won this fight”, he said.“I know for me the worst part has been the daily text message I receive at around 5 o’clock every evening of the number of deaths, and number of new cases,” the Taoiseach said. “I yearn for the day it stops.”The Full PlanTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin re-opening from May 18th under a roadmap which contains five phases.The first phase begins on May 18thIn this early stage, up to four people not of the same household will be able to meet outdoors while maintaining strict social distancing. Funerals will still be a maximum of ten people. Outdoor workers in construction can return including gardeners and those working on allotments. But remote working will remain in place for the vast majority of businesses. Garden centres and hardware stores can reopen as well as opticians, bike repairs and phone repairs.Electrical outlets may open\u0026nbspTennis courts and golf courses can reopen but social distancing will apply. Outdoor public amenities and tourism sites may open. A maximum of four people can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities. Schools and college buildings will be opened to allow teachers to organise remote learning.The second phase begins on June 8thIn this phase, people will now be permitted to travel up to 20km but will be advised to avoid all unnecessary journeys. Over 70s will be allowed to shop at specific hours. Visits to homes of over 70s will be permitted by no more than a few people for a short period of time and they must wear gloves, face coverings, maintaining strict 2m social distancing.For everyone else, up to four people may visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining strict social distancing. In terms of funerals, slightly larger numbers of people can be in attendance at funerals but they will still be restricted to immediate family and close friends.There will be a “phased return” of other workers who can maintain a distance from others of two metres at all times.\u0026nbspBusinesses that can maintain remote working will be asked to do so. Small retail outlets, with a small number of staff, and open marts could also\u0026nbspreopen.Libraries can open with limited numbers. People can engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities where there is a small group team but this does not include matches.The third phase begins on June 29thTravel restrictions will remain at 20km. Cafes and restaurants that can adhere to social distancing guidelines will reopen. Creches will be reopened but only for the children of essential workers. Hospital and prison visits may resume but consideration will have to be given to the availability of PPE in each unit.Businesses will be asked to continue with remote working where possible but organisations where employees have a low level of daily interaction may return. There will be a phased reopening of non-essential retail outlets on the basis of restriction on the number of staff and customers per square metre so that social distancing can be maintained. This will be limited to retail outlets with street-level entrance and exit i.e. which are not in enclosed shopping centres due to higher risk.Playgrounds will be reopened where social distancing and hygiene can be maintained. Some “behind closed doors” sporting activities will be permitted. Public transport will remain restricted. The Government will consider implementing travel restrictions on numbers travelling to and in major urban centres.The fourth phase begins on July 20thIn this phase, people can now travel outside their region. A slightly larger number of people (more than four, but the exact number has not yet been specified)\u0026nbspmay visit another household for a short period of time while maintaining social distancing. Small social gatherings by family and close friends will be limited to a maximum number of attendees for a limited period of time where social distancing can be maintained. The same will apply to other social gatherings outside of family and friends.Creches for all other workers will reopen but only for one a day a week to start with. Businesses will be asked to stagger work hours but Government will ask that remote working will continue. Hairdressers and barbers may reopen as well as museums, galleries, religious places of worship. Hotels and hostels will reopen on limited occupancy. Hotel bars will remain closed. Caravan and holiday parks may reopen. Restrictions on the numbers allowed to travel into urban centres will be decreased on public transport.The last phase begins on August 10thPubs, bars, nightclubs and casinos will reopen where social distancing and cleaning can be complied with. Festivals and other cultural gatherings may be held but with restricted numbers. Large weddings will still be restricted due to risk, as will other large gatherings. Normal visiting will resume in hospitals.A phased return to normal work will start around this time. Shopping centres will reopen as well as theatres and cinemas that can maintain social distancing. Close physical contact sports like rugby, boxing and wrestling will be permitted. Gyms can reopen where there is regular and effective cleaning.Sports spectatorship which involves mass gatherings will be permitted, but only in accordance with both indoor and outdoor number restrictions. Indoor recreational venues like roller skating, bowling alleys and bingo halls may open where numbers can be limited. High-risk organisations which cannot maintain social distancing will be asked to implement plans for how they can eventually return to full complement. Some time after this period, schools will reopen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245315.1588673753!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus the science big shift in thinking on face masks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHanwha Eagles players line up wearing face masks ahead of the opening game of South Korea’s new baseball season. Photograph: Jung Yeon-JeGettyAFPThis is a series of regular updates from  Environment \u0026amp Science Editor Kevin O’Sullivan on scientific initiatives and developments on coronavirus.The line was: evidence for wearing face masks in public is inconclusive, people won’t wear them properly any way and widespread demand will inevitably reduce supplies of medical-quality masks. All is now changed.US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention broke ranks after droplet tests indicated transmission of a virus could go beyond two metres – and advised cloth masks be worn in public.In early April a British Medical Journal article suggested the precautionary principle should apply as masks “could have a substantial impact on transmission with a relatively small impact on social and economic life.” This had a profound effect on thinking on this side of the Atlantic.In recent days, Arizona State University scientists showed masks save lives 80 per cent adoption could reduce mortality by 24 to 65 per cent.Yet the Irish position has shifted only marginally, to saying they may be required while shopping or on public transport. In line with WHO, the view that it’s more important to ensure continuity of supply of higher-grade face masks for healthcare workers and patients prevails here.The science could not be clearer and it’s odds on everyone will have to mask up as it’s clearly important – along with “wash your hands” and physical distancing. Clarity is urgently needed, however, and time for hundreds of thousands people emerging from lockdown to make or source masks – and to get used to wearing them.There is a broad consensus now that wearing even a basic cloth mask properly along with rapid testingtracing capacity and appropriate use of effective app technology will be all needed, if crushing Covid is to be realised.For those cooped up or cocooned at home who are beginning to hear strange voices saying “this Covid thing is a vague threat and overhyped in terms of risk now we’re over the peak”, a short reminder of its medical nastiness and horrible unpredictability is merited as an antidote for those cut loose arguments: Covid-19 affects the lungs and in more seriously ill people the kidney, the gut and the brain.It increases risk of blood clotting – and there is no indication why some get the virus and others don’t. It harder to identify in older people, who are among most vulnerable to the disease, and more difficult to treat. Those exposed to air pollution are believed to be more at risk.People of all ages with Covid pneumonia can suddenly become terribly ill and have to go into ICU. In some young children, it is believed to cause a form of toxic shock syndrome. What’s more, ethnic minorities and poorer people and those with other conditions are much more likely to die. Recovery can be difficult and can take months.And we don’t know how it will live on in populations how it might re-assert itself. Will it be like winter flu or remain dormant for a while like herpes? Will it return in a more virulent form? A University of Minnesota report suggests the pandemic could stretch on for two more years with recurring spikes until roughly two-thirds or more of the population is immune. So please lift that re-emergence lid carefully.Can you teach an old drug new tricks?Mr Trump’s overhyping of hydroxychloroquine aside, the antimalarial drug serves a great purpose. But self-administering it – as many did in the US after his intervention – was a shocking example of loose words costing lives.Niamh O’Boyle, assistant professor of pharmaceutical chemistry at TCD provides a timely warning: “Your old, crumpled box of anti-malarial drugs has been lying squashed at the back of a drawer from an overseas trip many years ago. You heard that guy on the TV saying it was a miracle cure for coronavirus. It can’t hurt to take it just in case, right?“But a few hours later, you start to get stomach cramps, blurred vision and vomiting. Soon after, your heart starts to skip a beat and you’re feeling faint.”You are likely to be suffering from a hydroxychloroquine overdose.Many commonly-used prescription drugs are safe only below a certain dose. At the correct dose, this drug can be a lifesaver for treating malaria, and managing rheumatoid arthritis.Scientists have shown it could stop Covid-19 from growing in plastic containers in the lab by preventing the virus attaching and getting inside human cells.“However, plastic containers are a world away from the intricate and beautifully evolved structures that are our human bodies,” Boyle notes.There is no evidence right now for effects – good or bad – in humans suffering from Covid though it’s being tested in the WHO solidarity clinical trial involving many hundreds of patients. “Until the results from large trials like this emerge in the coming weeks and months, it is likely to be used only for severely-ill patients in hospital.”So, is hydroxychloroquine a marvellous medicine or a false hope? Right now, until those trials results are in, we just don’t know. Boyle’s bottom line: don’t take this drug without proper medical supervision: “Imagine how you’d feel being rushed into A\u0026ampE with self-inflicted injuries at a time like this.”Mind how you go on fast-tracking trialsSome scientists have proposed a way to speed up the clinical trial process by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine’s efficacy.“This approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,” according to Nir Eyal, professor of bioethics at Rutgers University in the US.Volunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: “Their health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines,” he told the . The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.Young people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person, Eyal points out. We don’t know why yet. The final piece of the jigsaw (those large phase-three trials) are still some way off, so there is time to get the conditions right.Grounds for optimismEurope is getting it right: Much of Europe was slow to respond to coronavirus, but you cannot quibble with statistics. Almost all EU countries have now got their transmission score (a mathematical indicator, the R0) down below 1 – each case is leading to infection of less than one other person. If they don’t keep it that way, the scientist and great R0 explainer Angela Merkel will issue a swift reprimand.Defying prediction: It was predicted to claim 10 million lives in Africa. So far a continent of 1.2 billion people has suffered fewer Covid-19 deaths than the US was recording each day last week. Reasons are unclear – a young population, warm weather reducing droplet spread, BCG vaccination who knows? – a continent holds its breath.Blood test breakthrough: US military scientists have designed a new Covid-19 test that could potentially identify carriers before they become infectious and spread the disease. The blood test is quicker than the usual swab test though it deploys the same PCR technique. Once validated, Mr Trump, would you mind facilitating its global rollout?Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Programme for government to be drawn up after leaders met on TuesdayOther park users are asked to not visit between 1.30pm and 3.30pmUnion says relaxing coronavirus restrictions poses difficulties for public transportThose cocooning told to avoid contact with other people and not to go to the shopsDoherty says short -time health crisis will not become long-term economic one for workersCounsel for the State granted until 2pm to consider sworn statement from applicantsAlmost 600,000 people are now receiving the special Covid-19 unemployment paymentWicklow ideal to restore habitats and woodland but destruction is extensive, says authorMore than 80 per cent of people with respiratory illness concerned about testingMale aged 20 charged over September 2019 incident at Athboy, Co MeathMay 5th marks International Day of The MidwifeRemote hearings \u0026lsquoa way of tiding us over until we get back to physical hearings\u0026rsquoSenior Government figures have indicated that they are prepared to amend the Reopening Ireland planYoung Greens express disappointment at party\u0026rsquos decision to enter formal negotiationsStalled property market and the prospect of another economic downturn have badly hit solicitorsCovid-19 restrictions puts husband\u0026rsquos visa on holdMinister seeks seasonal vaccination for children and others in recognised at-risk groupsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245440.1588683776!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bus and rail passengers should have to wear face masks says nbru","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGardaí on O’Connell Street, Dublin, check passengers on board a Dublin Bus over the weekend. Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The Transport workers want face masks to be made compulsory for all commuters on their services.The National Bus and Rail Union (NBRU) said on Tuesday that mandatory wearing of face masks for all commuters should be put in place “to ensure maximum protection of frontline staff and enhance customer confidence”.The union also maintained in a letter to the National Transport Authority (NTA) that frontline transport workers who are required to interact with passengers should have their temperature checked on arrival for work using a laser thermometer.The NBRU said that while some elements of society would be able to cope with the relaxation of the coronavirus restrictions, public transport would “ encounter significant difficulties, not least due to the constraints associated with fleet capacity”.The union said that that transport workers who registered a high temperature should be provided with immediate assistance to access a test for the illness, also known as Covid-19.NBRU general secretary Dermot O’Leary said any worker with a high temperature should be sent home without loss of pay.“The waiting period for test results should not see the worker concerned suffering any loss of earnings. If the worker tests negative, they quickly return to work. If they test positive, they then receive the previously- agreed sick pay (CIE companies). Go-Ahead Ireland should apply similar payments, using its sick pay scheme.”The union also called for additional disinfection of transport fleets on a daily basis and the introduction of automatic “no touch” gel dispenser units in all locations where passengers accessed services.The NBRU said regular Monday to Friday schedules should be re-introduced to increase capacity and that all available fleet should be brought into use.“It is widely acknowledged that other countries are at different stages with the evolvement of easement measures, this is causing concern for frontline public transport staff that serve our airports, therefore special measures (vetting personnel) will have to be implemented to ensure potential virus carriers are not travelling on public transport services that serve our airports.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4245439.1588683724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 cocooners given designated time in dublin parks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA Covid-19 sign points to one of the exits from St Stephens Green in Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPeople who are aged over 70 or who are medically vulnerable have now been given a designated time to exercise in Dublin parks in a bid to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection.Since March 27th, older people and those who are particularly at risk of contracting a severe form of the illness were requested by the Government and health officials to cocoon and refrain from leaving their homes to protect themselves from coronavirus, which causes Covid-19.However, since Tuesday, that advice has been eased slightly and now allows those iniduals to leave their homes for one “short walk” or exercise each day.In order to ensure physical distancing for these people, the four Dublin local authorities have designated a two-hour period in local parks for people who are cocooning.The designation will come into effect from Wednesday, May 6th, and will apply to all parks across Dublin city and county, between 1.30 pm and 3.30 pm.Other park users are asked to consider using parks at other times so that those cocooning can have as much space and confidence in physical distancing as possible.Cllr Shay Brennan, Cathaoirleach of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county council, said the Covid-19 pandemic brings “many challenge” and it often must be faced by “thinking differently”.“I fully support this innovative plan to allow cocooners much needed dedicated space and time in the outdoors – allowing them the peace of mind that they can get their long-awaited fresh air and exercise in as safe an environment as possible,” Cllr Brennan said.Philomena Poole, chief executive of the council, added: “We are asking all other citizens to please take on board the request to leave this two-hour period for those who have been cocooning and to use the park at other times. It is extremely important that they can enjoy our parks and exercise in safety.”Health officials have issued new guidance to cocooners who do opt to go for a walk outside of their own garden or home.While outside, they are advised to stay two metres away from others, avoid physical contact with other people and they should also not touch any surfaces. Cocooners are also advised to wash their hands when they get home and to refrain from going to the shops.Speaking at the Government’s Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday morning, assistant secretary general at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan said “the key message is to avoid all contact with other people, maintain a no touch policy and wash your hands on returning home.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4244877.1588629112!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"near full flight without social distancing prompts aer lingus review","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t “The safety and security of Aer Lingus’s customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency.” Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins Dublin Aer Lingus is to conduct a review after pictures emerged of an almost full flight with no apparent evidence of social distancing measures.The airline said any process changes required would be implemented as a “matter of urgency”.The move came as pictures were shared from inside the cabin of a Belfast-London Heathrow flight on Monday morning, showing row after row filled with passengers.Passenger Sean Mallon told BBC Radio Ulster there was “no social distancing whatsoever”.“I would say there was about 95 per cent of the seats taken on the flight,” he said.In a statement, Aer Lingus said: “In light of the unexpectedly high loads on the Belfast-London Heathrow service this morning and the level of demand for the route, Aer Lingus is reviewing its processes and procedures applicable to the operation of this service.“The safety and security of Aer Lingus’s customers and crew is our top priority and any process changes that are identified as being required will be implemented as a matter of urgency.” – Press AssociationEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4243939.1588523161!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain rejects request for permanent eu office in belfast","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove wrote to the SDLP, Sinn Féin, Alliance and the Greens saying that an EU office in Belfast was unnecessary. Photograph: Chris J RatcliffeGettyThe British government has been accused of being “petty”, “provocative” and “unhelpful” after it rejected a request for the European Union to have a permanent office in Belfast. British cabinet office Minister Michael Gove responded to the North’s four pro-Remain parties – Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens – to say that an office was unnecessary.Mr Gove said it would facilitate, where necessary, ad hoc visits by EU officials to Northern Ireland but it did not accept any permanent EU presence was required in Northern Ireland.The four parties wrote to the British prime minister Boris Johnson last month urging that an EU office be re-established. The EU also made a request for an office in Belfast.The previously permanent European Commission office closed at the end of January when the UK quit the EU.There was an expectation at the time that some form of EU presence would be created later to assist continuing EU-UK business, but Mr Gove, responding on behalf of Mr Johnson, appears to have closed down that possibility.The current stance of the British government appears in direct contrast to its position in February last year when it said it not only supported having an EU office in Belfast but in London, Edinburgh and Cardiff as well.Just over a week ago Mr Gove told British MPs there was no need for a “mini embassy” in Belfast.In the 2016 referendum, 56 per cent of the electorate in Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU.EU fundingNotwithstanding the negative response, the Irish Government appears not to have given up hope that an office might yet be created. Previous figures from the European Commission office in Belfast show that going back to 1989 the EU supported the peace process, agriculture, fisheries, jobs and much more to the tune of more than €13 billion. It also plans to continue providing peace funding in the North.“We would see no issue in terms of the Good Friday agreement in having an EU office in Northern Ireland, not least given ongoing EU support for the peace process,” said a Department of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman on Sunday.“The Irish Government hopes this matter can be accommodated in a way that satisfies both sides’ needs and sensitivities,” she added.The Sinn Féin MP for North Belfast John Finucane said Mr Gove’s “mini embassy” comments were “provocative and deeply unhelpful at a crucial period in Brexit negotiations”.“The ongoing opposition by the British government to a European Union office in the North is in bad faith,” he said.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the British government response was “petty” but “unsurprising”.Alliance leader Naomi Long also described the decision as “petty”.“This gamesmanship from the UK government is reflective of their wider approach of not taking preparations for the implementation of the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol seriously,” she said. The DUP and Ulster Unionist Party, however, supported the British government’s position. In a brief statement, a DUP spokesman said, “We agree with UK government policy.”The Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said there was no need for a permanent office in Belfast“The idea of EU ‘perm reps’ with extra jurisdiction powers like the EU had in the Balkans is simply not acceptable in the UK – and it is inconceivable that any EU country would accept that on their sovereign territory,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph:  Patricia de Melo MoreiraAFP via Getty ImagesWith its rapidly ageing population and close-knit family-oriented society, Portugal has much in common with its neighbour Spain. But while the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc in Spain, Portugal has had vastly lower infection and death rates.Spain has recorded more than 25,000 Covid-19 deaths, yet Portugal, with a quarter of the population, has recorded just over 1,000. As Portugal and other EU countries begin to ease their lockdowns, Lisbon fears a second wave of infections could reverse a success attributed to its quick response, extensive testing, collegiate politics and strong social support.“Timing is everything in the early stages of a pandemic because viral dissemination is exponential,” said Pedro Simas, head of the viral pathogenesis lab at Portugal’s Institute of Molecular Medicine (IMM). “Even one week has an enormous impact.”Portugal detected its first coronavirus cases on March 2nd, a month later than Italy and Spain. The government declared a state of emergency 16 days after the outbreak began, by which time the country had recorded 642 cases and two deaths. In comparison, Spain announced tough lockdown measures about six weeks after the first case appeared, by which time it had recorded almost 5,800 cases and 200 deaths.But even before the government had ordered a lockdown, many Portuguese people had chosen to stay at home. “People were witnessing the heartbreaking images from Italy and Spain and decided to take matters into their own hands,” said Ricardo Baptista Leite, head of public health at Lisbon’s Catholic University. “This was a critical element in our response.”Isabel Abreu, a biochemist in the high-risk category for Covid-19, began working from home almost two weeks before it became compulsory. “People who could generally did the same,” she said. The government introduced a furlough scheme under which laid-off workers received two-thirds of their wages, of which the state pays 70 per cent.Health workersTesting was also key. Portugal has tested more than 350,000 people for coronavirus, having steadily built a network that can complete more than 15,000 tests a day. That equates to more than 35,000 tests per million inhabitants, proportionally more than many other European countries.More than 60 state, university and private labs have worked together to test as many people as possible, focusing on health workers and nursing home residents. “We face the same difficulties as every country in trying to buy testing materials, but our central purchasing office gives us more of a single voice in international markets and helps improve distribution,” said Marta Temido, health minister.The fact that Portugal had fewer densely populated cities, a single land border, a lower level of international traffic and less immigration also helped, as did cross-party support for the Socialist government’s coronavirus strategy. “We are focusing on collaboration, not opposition,” said Baptista Leite, also health spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats. “In times like these, unity and solidarity save lives.”This combined to ensure pressure on an under-resourced national health service was kept at a manageable level. “Due to early social distancing measures, the number of critically ill patients has never come close to breaking point as it has in some other countries,” said Maria Manuel Mota, a biologist at the IMM. But as Portugal adjusts this week to a gradual relaxation of confinement measures, health specialists and politicians fear a second wave of the pandemic could hit it hard.“Having been so efficient in controlling the first wave of infection puts Portugal in an extremely susceptible situation,” said Simas. “We are completely blind to the percentage of people that have been exposed to the virus and are potentially immune.”The government has approved a cautious, three-phase plan to ease the lockdown, including the compulsory use of face masks in many public spaces and remote working whenever possible.Small shops will be allowed to open first, followed by increasingly bigger stores in the second and third phases. Remote teaching will remain in place for most children until the end of the academic year.Portuguese scientists are close to implementing a system of serological antibody testing that will show whether people have been infected with coronavirus. This will initially be targeted at frontline health workers.“Our apparently good results in this phase could be a disadvantage in terms of the immunity of our population in a second wave,” Ms Temido said. “We will only be able to say what countries have responded well when the history of the pandemic is written.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"dame judi dench mangy cats costume looked like five foxes f","story":"Audiences for the Hollywood version of Cats were haunted by the terrible costumes and CGI. So too was its most venerable star, Dame Judi Dench.The Oscar-winning actress has disclosed that, when she signed up for the film, she expected her character Old Deutoronomy to look rather elegant.Instead, she told Vogue magazine, she ended up as “a battered, mangy old cat. A great big orange bruiser. What’s that about?” As for the cloak she was made to wear: “Like five foxes f---ing on my back.”At 85, Dame Judi is the oldest person ever to grace the cover of British Vogue. Edward Enninful, the editor, called her “the unassailable queen of stage and screen” and said: “She brings great perspective and a message of hope from her own quarantine in the English countryside.  “Ever modest, the dame is not a fan of the term ‘national treasure’. But treasure her we do. Now more than ever.”Dame Judi was photographed for the cover in early February but part of the interview was conducted after lockdown.“I am sure I feel, like everyone else, such unprecedented times are quite hard to comprehend. What is a good thing is that it has made people aware of the predicament of others who are completely alone. If a great deal of kindness comes out of this, then that will be a plus,” she said. She dismissed any talk of retirement when the interviewer raised it, admonishing: “Don’t use that word…. Wash your mouth out.” The actress said she lived by the words of Dylan Thomas: “’Rage, rage against the dying of the light.’ Never was a truer word spoken.”Her dream role, she said, would be to play someone “who everyone this is a kindly, saintly, beatified kind of person, and she’s actually killing people.”One of Dame Judi’s most memorable roles was playing M in the Bond franchise. Asked if a woman could ever be cast as the spy, she said: “I don’t think Ian Fleming would want a female Bond.” Female action leads are a perfectly good thing, she said, but “call it something else, then.”:: The full interview is in the June issue of Vogue, available from Thursday May 7   More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greece could welcome back tourists july 1 prime minister says","story":"Greece could open up to tourism in early July, the country’s prime minister says, giving hope to millions of holidaymakers longing to flock to its sun-soaked islands and whitewashed hilltop villages.Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the “best-case scenario” is that tourism in Greece could restart on July 1.“We’re working towards that, he told CNN in an interview. “Of course it involves airlines, because most people fly into Greece.”The exact date will also depend on the implementation of health protocols between countries.Unlike Italy, Spain and France, Greece has emerged relatively unscathed by the pandemic.The government was quick to impose a lockdown and so far just 146 people have died of the virus – compared to nearly 30,000 in Italy.Tourism makes up around 20 per cent of the Greek economy and the tourism sector is desperate to get going again, having missed out on revenue at Easter.The economy is expected to contract up to 10 per cent this year according to the International Monetary Fund – a bitter blow just as the country was beginning to get back on its feet after a decade of austerity.Tourists might have to be tested for Covid-19 before they board planes bound for Greece.There would be “very specific protocols,” said the prime minister, whose government was elected last summer.“The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you’ve had in previous years, with more social distancing, maybe no bars open.“But you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path.”The government has decreed that open-air archaeological sites can reopen on May 18, while hotels and restaurants can reopen on June 1.The EU must come up with health protocols that will allow people to travel again, Mr Mitsotakis said.Israel, Greece and Cyprus are discussing the idea of setting up a safe zone in which each others’ citizens would be able to travel. All three countries have had a low number of deaths and infections from Covid-19.This is a very preliminary initiative by aviation officials in these countries, and of course depends on approvals and consent from others,” reported the Israeli broadcaster Kann. Cyprus and Greece are both popular tourist destinations for Israelis.Israel announced a de facto shutdown of all its borders in March in response to the coronavirus.The country has reported only 235 deaths and 16,000 infections - 10,000 of whom have recovered.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2020/05/04/TELEMMGLPICT000230566264_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1qK9fS0WD7QU0EDCDdqwlh8X6iOpiIWEItn7dHA-Jwo.jpeg?imwidth","title":"public opinion no obstacle lifting lockdown","story":"Polls show not a love of lockdown but rather a willingness to follow the Prime Minister\u0026#39s leadMuch has been made of the fact that the public tell opinion polls they don’t want lockdown to end. Only 11 per cent, for example, are ready for pubs and restaurants to reopen only eight per cent want to allow mass gatherings straightaway. From this it is concluded that Boris Johnson will find it hard to persuade people to lift restrictions.That is surely a false conclusion. It is more likely that people are simply following the logic of public policy. Since the middle of March, in the most concentrated public messaging campaign ever, people have been told that they must stay at home to save lives. After a bit of grumbling at first, they decided to do so. Even if it does later turn out that the policy was wrong, it was rational to comply.Since then, the statistics have appeared to reinforce the original message. Only in very recent days have hospital death rates started to fall, and the late arrival of care-home death figures has added a new dimension of anxiety. It feels as if the crisis continues.You change your mind only if presented with clear information and argument from those in authority. No such information has yet been furnished by experts and no such argument has yet been made by ministers. Returning from his own hospitalisation due to the coronavirus, Boris Johnson went out of his way to say that the Covid “mugger” had not yet been wrestled to the ground.What the polls show, then, is not that the Prime Minister is confronting a terrified populace who won’t do what he wants. It is that the populace has followed his lead so far. If people are shown clear evidence that the situation on the ground is changing, then their attitudes will change too. They will almost certainly follow his lead again.If the statistics continue their present trends, the public will be ready for change surprisingly soon.Universities, which are now suffering so badly from the lockdown, should reconsider their almost unanimous hostility to Brexit. Under EU membership, students from other EU countries were allowed to study in Britain at the same rates as British students (and vice versa). They were also entitled to British government-backed student loans.For the time being, these arrangements remain in place, but they will soon come up for review, and they should change.The policy has meant that EU students have escaped the much higher fees which are chargeable to other foreign students. This in turn means that universities which fill up with students from the EU forego the financial benefit that would accrue if non-EU foreign students could take up their places.There were 139,000 EU students in the United Kingdom in 2017-18. If they were now to be replaced by non-EU students and by EU students paying the full whack, much more money would come in and there would still be a decent amount of space to give places to larger numbers of British students.The Government would benefit too: in 2018-19 it handed out £532 million in loans to EU students. It is quite likely that most of that enormous figure will be lost, because EU states tend not to enforce repayment, since it is not their money at stake.Of course it might turn out that our least successful universities would not be able to find enough replacements to survive. To put it brutally, that too would be a bonus.It may be well, in terms of health, that we should all wear masks as we increasingly venture out to shop, but if I were a retailer, I would have a simple anxiety.As has often been discussed in relation to wearing the burqa, having your face visible is a fairly basic part of the mutual trust necessary for successful citizenship. If your shop is full of people wearing masks, how do you identify a shoplifter?Given that it is more or less summer, could there not be more experiment with selling things outdoors? Obviously, social distancing remains a problem, but grocers’ shops have managed to make it work, so I do not see why much larger spaces should not do so too as we start easing restrictions.One factor which helps is that such large spaces are temporarily available. These are otherwise known as station car-parks. Although some trains are running, the station car-parks I have seen are operating at about two per cent of normal capacity.It would be a good moment to try out farmers’ markets andor car-boot sales on the deserted tarmac. Many of the stations have enough room to provide room for controlled parking as well as market stalls.Last week, this column proposed VE Day as an opportunity for church leaderships to show some return to life after the virus. There is still not much sign of episcopal activity, but the grass-roots are stirring to get round the bureaucracy.It was planned to ring church bells 75 times in honour of the 75 years that have passed since May 1945. But of course we are not allowed peals of bells, thanks to Covid-19. Under the rules, bells may not be rung except for the purpose of testing them. An enterprising vicar known to me has therefore arranged for the bells in the churches under his care to be “tested” 75 times this Friday.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

That doesn\u0027t sound strange at all, but more completely to be expected.Yves Cohen, head of intensive care at the Avicenne hospital in Paris, told BFM TV on Sunday that his staff had retested samples taken from patients admitted for pneumonia in December, and that one from December 27 had tested positive for coronavirus - even though the 53-year-old patient had not travelled to China.Previously, Europe’s first case of Covid-19 was confirmed on January 24,  almost a month later.Tegnell said he did not believe that the virus had been present in Sweden, or the rest of Europe, to a significant extent before cases began to multiply in February and March.Right now, this isn\u0027t the sort of investigation we want to burden our health system with, he said. There\u0027s a lot of other things to do, and this won\u0027t lead to any new actions.According to Sweden\u0027s defence forces, none of the 100 Swedish soldiers who were in Wuhan in October last year to take part in the 2019 Military World Games had tested positive for coronavirus.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden suppressed infection rates without lockdown","story":"Last Wednesday, the two countries\u0027 health agencies both published their report cards, giving estimates on what difference their contrasting approaches had made to the rate at which the infection is spreading - the famous \u0027R number\u0027.The result? Not that much.If the R number is 1, it means that each person infected goes on to infect an average of one other person during the course of their illness. So long as a country keeps R below one, the number of infections will steadily decrease until the pandemic comes to an end.Sweden\u0027s numbers are a standing rebuke to the Imperial College study that has done so much to influence UK policy. Researchers at the university predicted that Sweden\u0027s approach would leave it with an R of above 3, leading to 40,000 coronavirus deaths by May 1. Sweden\u0027s current death tally is just 2,769.Uno Wennergren, a mathematician and pandemic modeller at Linköping University, suspects Sweden\u0027s low number in part comes from growing levels of immunity in Stockholm, where the outbreak has so far been concentrated, and in part from social distancing.Denmark\u0027s much heavier lockdown helped push the R number as low as 0.6 in mid-April, only creeping back to 0.9 after it opened schools on April 15 - although the increase may have more to do with the weather and the effects of lockdown fatigue.This apparently small difference has had a big impact in terms of hospital admissions and death: Sweden\u0027s cumulative coronavirus death rate, at 274 deaths per million inhabitants, is now triple that of Denmark.This doesn\u0027t say anything about the rest of Sweden. Wennergren warns that the sub-1 R number for Sweden as a whole might be heavily weighed down by a high immunity in Stockholm, masking a rapid spread elsewhere.We could end up on the other side of the Stockholm peak and think we’re doing fine, and instead get a wave-like plateau that is a result of different regions overlapping one another, he said. What we are trying to do now is to model it by the different regions... Until we have done that, I think it will be really hard to know where this is going to land.At the end of April, Wennergren estimated on Swedish national TV that between 10,000 and 20,000 people will ultimately die of coronavirus in the country. This means the virus has so far claimed, at best, only a quarter of its likely victims.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/03/25/11/empty-shelves-uk.jpg","title":"coronavirus recession economy what is when uk us","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to trigger the worst depression in a centuryThe next global recession is upon us\u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspand it already has a name: “The Great Lockdown”.Experts predict the coronavirus pandemic\u0026nbspwill trigger the worst economic slump since the Great Depression of the 1920s.Almost every country in the world is likely to be\u0026nbspaffected, and the UK – already facing financial uncertainty\u0026nbspdue to Brexit – will be no exception.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen will the recession hit the UK?The UK may already be in recession. Like many other nations, we have\u0026nbspseen share prices tumble, unemployment claims rise and businesses shut up shop – in some cases permanently – as a result of social distancing restrictionsHowever the technical, commonly-accepted definition of a recession is a contraction\u0026nbspin gross domestic product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters.In other words, the\u0026nbsptotal amount of goods and services produced by the UK would have to fall for a total period of six months.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastThe latest quarterly figures available only\u0026nbspcover the three months from October 2019 to December 2019, well before the first case of Covid-19 was reported on 31 January and the beginning of the lockdown in March.That showed UK GDP as remaining\u0026nbspflat, with zero growth from the previous quarter.Figures for the first quarter of 2020 (January to March) will not be published until 12 May, with the second quarter to follow three months after that.It means that,\u0026nbspunless the previous quarterly figures are revised, we may\u0026nbspnot\u0026nbspknow for sure if the UK is\u0026nbspin recession until August.How bad will the recession be?The Treasury’s official forecaster,\u0026nbspthe Office for Budget Responsibility, has predicted the UK GDP could fall by a staggering 35 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 (between April and June).That would make it\u0026nbspthe worst slump in over 300 years – since the Great Frost of 1709, when temperatures plummeted to -10C.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spain’s economy also contracted by around 5 per cent in the first quarter.Overall the global economy is expected to shrink by 3 per cent in 2020,\u0026nbspmaking it far worse than the 2008 crisis and the worst since the Great Depression. Of the major nations only China and India are expected to record growths in GDP for 2020.How long will it last?The predictions for the UK\u0026nbspare based on the assumption that the\u0026nbsplockdown\u0026nbspwill last three months (until 23 June) and that economic activity will gradually return to normal over the three months after that.What will actually happen remains uncertain. Boris Johnson is facing increasing calls to set out his “exit strategy” to remove restrictions and an announcement is expected early next week.However some restrictions may have to remain in place for much longer and a return to normal life involving pubs, restaurants and football games (for example) looks increasingly unlikely this year.If so, the effects on the UK economy could be even worse than predicted.When will the UK economy recover?Assuming a six-month lockdown effect, the OBR expects\u0026nbspGDP to rebound by 27 per cent in the third\u0026nbspquarter of 2020 (July to September) and 21 per cent in the fourth quarter (October to December).Under this scenario the GDP would return to its pre-virus level by the end of the year.But any recovery depends on the persistence of Covid-19 and the possibility of a “second wave” of infection.“The forceful impact of COVID-19 and the global lockdown has thrust the economy into unknown territory where we could see GDP declining at a record quarterly rate,” said economist\u0026nbspKemar\u0026nbspWhyte, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.“Nonetheless, instant and significant recovery remain a distinct possibility if the spread of the virus comes to halt quickly.”Office for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That was down from 34.5 in March, which had already been a record low. In the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the survey fell to 40.1.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 79 per cent of services businesses reported activity fell in April. Much of the decline\u0026nbspwas expected because restaurants, bars, non-essential retailers and other services businesses were forced\u0026nbspto shut down on 23 March to slow the spread of Covid-19.But the survey demonstrates just how drastically\u0026nbspactivity has been curtailed. Government measures such as grants to hospitality businesses and cheap loans to small firms have been designed to ensure that, as much as possible, the contraction is a temporary result of the coronavirus lockdown and does not develop into a longer-term depression.The PMI\u0026nbspsurvey\u0026nbspis seen as an early indicator of future economic performance because it polls managers in companies about what is happening to their orders and supplies.But forecasting how the economy will perform beyond the immediate time horizon has become a near-impossible task, with huge disparities between the most pessimistic and optimistic projections.The news came as the UK death toll from coronavirus surpassed that of every other European nation. Only the US - with a population five times the size - has seen more Covid-19 deaths.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: April\u0027s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.Historical comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the April survey reading is consistent with the economy falling at a quarterly rate of approximately 7 per cent, but we expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater, in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector.Just one in five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During their peak, as many as 30 of the meteors can be seen each hour.One of the most remarkable things about the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbspis their speed. They shoot into Earth\u0027s atmosphere at about 150,000mph, and can leave glowing lines across the sky as their glowing debris is left in their wake.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe show will be best viewed in the southern hemisphere, since the constellation from which they emerge is higher up in the sky and therefore any meteors are more easily spotted. In the northern hemisphere, they will often seem to skim across the horizon, giving them the name Earthgrazers.As ever, the key to seeing any meteor shower is to go somewhere that is relatively dark so that light pollution will not get in the way of the view. That may be complicated by coronavirus lockdowns and social distancing, and any trips should only be made if they are recommended.First credible evidence emerges of person being killed by meteorTo get a view, look up into the sky and try to hold your gaze there. Over time – after about 30 minutes or so – your eyes should be able to see better in the dark and any meteors will come into view.Meteor showers come when the Earth moves into the debris from comets that have moved around our Solar System. As those leftovers collide with the Earth\u0027s atmopshere, they break up create blazing lights in the sky.Each year, the Earth moves regularly through those chunks of debris. That means that the meteor showers are predictable and come at the same time each year.The debris that create the\u0026nbspEta\u0026nbspAquariids\u0026nbsporiginally came from Halley\u0027s Comet. When it makes its regular trips into the solar system – each orbit takes around 76 years – it leaves behind new debris, and the leftovers from the same comet also lead to the Orionids in October.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company has developed rechargeable, lithium-ion battery-storage projects called Tesla PowerPack and Powerwall, which have been used in Wales\u0026nbspand other parts of the UK.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe company also built the world’s-largest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, which Tesla claims\u0026nbspcan provide enough power for more than 30,000 homes.However, rather than being a direct energy provider, the company could also be using the application to launch its Autobidder service in the UK, which uses machine-learning to give information to other companies so they can better “autonomously monetize battery assets,” according to a company product page.How Tesla revolutionised the electic car marketTesla recently partnered with Octopus in the UK for Tesla car owners who have solar panels or a Powerwall to offer cheaper energy.“Your solar system, Powerwall and EV charging are connected to Tesla’s energy management platform. It is designed to improve the way you use your energy to power your lifestyle and allows any stored by your Powerwall to be exported back to the grid, to benefit both you and the community” the company wrote on an FAQ page.\u0026nbspWhether these activities are part of its application remains to be seen we have reached out to the company for comment.On Friday, Tesla founder Elon Musk deducted $14bn (£11.2bn) from the company\u0027s value after tweeting that the company’s stock was “too high” in a series of tweets where the CEO also said he would be selling almost all of his possessions.Asked whether the tweets had been checked by his lawyers before being posted, Musk said “No”.Musk has also tweeted about the lockdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which he called\u0026nbsp“fascistic”.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that is a cost very much worth paying.“Even despite mass furloughing, unemployment is still soaring, with over 2 million new claims for benefits coming though.“This should remind us how badly needed the retention scheme is, but also that we are likely to be living with the legacy of high unemployment that coronavirus has given Britain, long after it has been phased out.”The figures came as pensions minister Therese Coffey said the government had received 1.8 million claims for Universal Credit between 16 March and the end of April.Ms Coffey said that overall, the volume of welfare claims had been six times bigger than pre-coronavirus during that period, and that in one particular week the increase had been tenfold.Additional reporting by agenciesOffice for Budget Responsibility\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Los Angeles, US, 700 food packages will go to homeless military veterans. Other projects are in India and Ethiopia.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Naomi Hallum, director of the organisation, which is funded by donations, said: “We hope that the $100,000 of food we are giving will help relieve some of the suffering caused by Covid-19, but the real value of our work lies in education, in telling people how and why these pandemics emerge, in showing the destruction caused to our planet and our bodies when we eat animal products.“The coronavirus pandemic, like many others before it, is creating tragedies for families all over the world.

That was down from 34.5 in March, which had already been a record low. In the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, the survey fell to 40.1.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAround 79 per cent of services businesses reported activity fell in April. Much of the decline\u0026nbspwas expected because restaurants, bars, non-essential retailers and other services businesses were forced\u0026nbspto shut down on 23 March to slow the spread of Covid-19.But the survey demonstrates just how drastically\u0026nbspactivity has been curtailed. Government measures such as grants to hospitality businesses and cheap loans to small firms have been designed to ensure that, as much as possible, the contraction is a temporary result of the coronavirus lockdown and does not develop into a longer-term depression.The PMI\u0026nbspsurvey\u0026nbspis seen as an early indicator of future economic performance because it polls managers in companies about what is happening to their orders and supplies.But forecasting how the economy will perform beyond the immediate time horizon has become a near-impossible task, with huge disparities between the most pessimistic and optimistic projections.The news came as the UK death toll from coronavirus surpassed that of every other European nation. Only the US - with a population five times the size - has seen more Covid-19 deaths.Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, said: April\u0027s PMI data highlights that the downturn in the UK economy during the second quarter of 2020 will be far deeper and more widespread than anything seen in living memory.Historical comparisons of the PMI with GDP indicate that the April survey reading is consistent with the economy falling at a quarterly rate of approximately 7 per cent, but we expect the actual decline in GDP could be even greater, in part because the PMI excludes the vast majority of the self-employed and the retail sector.Just one in five service providers managed to avoid a drop in business activity since March and those hardest hit by social distancing measures and travel restrictions often reported complete stoppages of business operations.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

and prepared to extend the shutdown into June.This is despite economic pressures as the UK face their worst slump in history.But Mr Johnson says he believes Britain will come charging back once the lockdown is over.Dominic Raab, who stood in for the Prime Minister when Mr Johnson was hospitalised with coronavirus, extended the initial three-week lockdown on Thursday, April .Brits will all be eager to hear what the Government has to say regarding the lockdown when they review the current measures.Among those high on the list will be whether the restrictions will be relaxed.Heres what could be covered during the speech on Sunday, May :Boris Johnson has ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.All Brits must comply with these measures.The police have been given the powers to enforce them through fines and dispersing gatherings.Cops can issue on-the-spot fines of £ for meeting without good reason.The fine can be halved to £paid swtly and repeat offenders will be hit by a doubling of the fine each time.Brits have not had as many restrictions enforced upon them as many other European countries.Citizens required special permits to be allowed to leave their houses in Spain, France, Italy, and Germany, although restrictions are being eased across Europe.But Germans face having toto tighter lockdown restrictions after a rise in cases.On  March, , Boris Johnson announced a partial, three-week-long lockdown, telling Brits to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus.Lockdown restrictions could last until June, while social distancing rules are expected to remain in place beyond that.But some measures could yet be tightened in areas where infections are rising under a whack-a-mole strategy.The new plans could lead to even stricter restrictions being imposed on areas such as care homes, prisons or whole towns.Michael Gove confirmed this approach on Sunday, May , telling the daily coronavirus briefing at No: “It is important that we make clear that any approach we take is staged.And although Mr Johnson wants the country to fall into step, with restrictions being lted gradually at the same pace nationwide, officials in Scotland and Ireland have started to unveil their strategies.Ireland has announced it will begin easing restrictions on May .Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said that Ireland will begin the first of five phases in late May.The easing will begin with small social gatherings, funerals and outdoor activities.By August the Irish will be able to go to pubs and small festivals again.The key part of the plan is social distancing, which will be implemented throughout each of the stages.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has readied residents for another month of lockdown.Ms Sturgeon said: “I have to be straight with you, it may very well be too early, even this time next week, in any meaningful way, to safely lt any of the current restrictions.”And Boris Johnson wants Britain to be back at work from Tuesday, May  - as long as coronavirus cases are low enough.But worried Brits dont want the lockdown lted yet, with fewer than one in five supporting the reopening of schools, restaurants, stadiums and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"tommy in the window ve day","story":"As VE celebrations have been cancelled this year due to the coronavirus, Brits are being urged to place a soldier in their windows.Armed forces charity Royal British Legion Industries have launched its Tommy in the Window campaign, producing clear plastic figures of soldiers, who were known as Tommys in WWII.They are asking for people to place them in the window to show respect for those who fought for our country.The campaign has received the backing of the former head of the British Army General Lord Richard Dannatt, who said the Covid- crisis should not stop people marking the anniversary of the end of the war in Europe in .“Public mood is low, but we owe it to ourselves as a nation to recognise those who gave their lives in the Second World War, and also those who endured so much at home, to win us our freedom,” he said.“I would hope that the country could draw a lot of strength from remembering the generations and all our relatives who pulled together at that time.”The figures are made by injured veterans in its social enterprise factory.More than , of the cm high perspex figures have been purchased so far.The models can be purchased on the VE day website here.Each soldier comes with a special edition number printed on the base, VE day booklet and VE day window sticker.Although the exact origins of the term Tommy is unknown, it is commonly said the term comes from Tommy Atkins, which is slang for a common soldier in the British Army.It dates back as early as , however, the term Tommy was chosen as a generic name by the war office in .The story goes that in WW German soldiers would call out “Tommy” across no man’s landthey wanted to speak to a British soldier.RBLI Tommy represents military services and all those that have served for our country.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If the current measures start to erode, unforeseen dangers could arise.Yet, move too quickly and you risk being blamed for getting it wrong.In some form continuing to isolate without isolation will be necessary, but avoiding great damage to the most disadvantaged children, many of whom are receiving no schooling at all, is vital for our future.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Many studies show women are more focused on building community and teams.They are more likely than men to cultivate a erse set of advisers to help them succeed. They are also more likely to follow advice.A study by management consulting firm McKinsey found that women are more people- orientated and spend more time developing and coaching other leaders in their organisation. In other words, they don’t need to reserve all the glory for themselves.There is something  at play too, though. Female leaders are more likely to be blameddecisions are unpopular or ineffective. They are questioned and second-guessed more often than men.But then Covid- entered the equation and presented world leaders with a new challenge — an invisible enemy that is highly contagious, unpredictable and deadly.This pandemic has been an unprecedented test for all concerned.And guess what  A disproportionate number of those who have passed this test — countries such as Germany, New Zealand, Iceland and Finland — have women at the helm.It is not exclusively female-led countries that are doing well, of course. But bearing in mind only seven per cent of all world leaders are women, about  per cent of countries led by women are doing well when it comes to containing Covid-. Global health experts have concluded that one thing that has led to success in tackling coronavirus is — speed.Prof Tom Bollyky, director of global health programme at US think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said: “Countries that have not dithered in their response, that have mobilised quickly, have done well.”New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern put it simply: “Go hard and go early.”The number of Covid--related deaths is predicted to be substantially lower in areas where leaders acted sooner, even by a week, because they flattened the curve and prevented new cases.Many women acted first and made the brave decision to shut down le as we knew it, even though that was an unpopular thing to do.But it seems women leaders are listening to World Health Organisation advice and also looking at other countries for guidance.They don’t think they have all the answers but women are able to put their ego to one side and let experts guide them — something which cannot be said of Donald Trump.Incidentally, I have not seen any women leaders making unfounded or dangerous suggestions about possible cures. Can you imagine a woman leader suggesting that people inject Dettol into themselves, as dingbat Trump recently suggested Or can you imagine a woman suggesting to people that they can fight coronavirus and winthey are strong enough This pandemic is not a battle to be fought and won. It is a virus, which can affect literally anyone.No one knows how they will be affected and that bullish “fight it” approach is, in my experience, very male. Conversely, the decision to protect everyone, putting the most at risk first, is more female.It’s interesting that some male leaders seem more interested in covering up the problems. Like Donald Trump, who thinks he is an expert on everything and more fixated on garnering praise for what he has done than fixing and getting right what has not gone so well.I know I am talking in generalisations here but my experience of women is that we want to understand the mistakes and fix them, not cover them up.This pandemic has been full of dficulty and tragedy for everyone.But perhaps one good thing that will come out of it is that the world will acknowledge women deserve an equal  when it comes to leadership.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Still, saying goodbye to their companions was devastating for people. Their dogs are their company, love, loyalty and trust – their everything. Driving the dog away, I’d burst into tears.”Six weeks into lockdown the owners are missing their dogs, but Michelle sends them daily pictures and videos to reassure them.“Some of the dogs slept in the bottom of their owners’ sleeping bags so we bought sleeping bags for them to burrow into,” Michelle says. “Others preferred to be on top of duvets. Their kennels are heated and during the day we keep the dogs busy, playing in our three acres of grounds, so there’s no time to pine for their owners.”One dog – Miss L, a young husky – is a case in point. Her owner was distraught when he said goodbye to her – they’d been together since she was eight weeks old – and he was worried about how she’d cope without him. But Michelle discovered she loves cheese, which helped gain her trust, and now Miss L is settled in, making friends with fellow lockdown pups.Some homeless people, however, couldn’t face being parted from their canine companions so remained on the streets. Michelle and her team are there to support them too.“We’re operating the mobile clinic as a food bank for dogs, and the   emergency line,” Michelle says. “We’ve had people in dire financial straits contact us saying they can’t afford to keep their dogs and we’ve organised food parcels so they can stay together.”In the current crisis, working on the streets, Michelle and her volunteers are effectively on the front line. A medical supply company donated gloves and masks and Deborah Meaden sent hand sanitisers to help them.Still, Michelle has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly Covid- related, and is recovering at home with her ex-street dog Brock by her side while her team continue DOTS’ work.“I just want to get better and back out there, helping the homeless community,” Michelle says. “There will be some emotional reunions when this is over.”When British schools went into Covid- lockdown, a nationwide network of teachers, including Sandra Obike, stepped up to support NHS heroes.Sandra, who is head of design and technology at Swanlea School in east London, immediately put her skills and workspace to best use – first, sourcing spare unused personal protective equipmentthat could be donated to a nearby major hospital, and then using her school design and technologylab to create  brand new visors for key workers.And she isn’t alone – DT staff at more than  British schools are now collectively involved in the fight against Covid-, manufacturing and donating more than , items of vital PPE including visors, goggles, scrubs, masks and more.“We’ve been doing things since the very first week of lockdown, communicating using sites like Facebook, sharing resources and free design templates,” explains Sandra.“I asked our school headteacherwe could use the materials, space and machinery, and she instantly said yes. I also had a contact at Royal London Hospital, and asked: ‘Can I help  Would it be useful to have some visors ’, and she jumped at the chance.“I knew immediately that we had some unused PPE like goggles, aprons and gloves – so we sent that to the hospital at the start of April, so they were able to start using it as soon as possible.”Sandra, her boyfriend and one of her DT colleagues then set to work at school, creating new visors while safely observing social distancing. They used open-source design templates – provided for free by expert companies like Kitronik and Smoke  Mirrors, who’ve also been key to this Covid- effort – and their ingenuity with the materials they already had.“We were working pretty much like an assembly line, cutting the material, sterilising the parts, assembling it all and then bagging everything for delivery,” says Sandra.“As a teacher, I’m now working from home and interacting with students, but making visors was something I could do while still continuing my day-to-day job. I felt like it was something I could do in the interim, to keep key workers safe, while there was a shortage of PPE.”It’s clear that Sandra is passionate about her DT teaching profession: “We’re educating the engineers of the future,” she says.There’s also no doubt that creating visors is for her a very personal response: “A lot of my family members and friends work within the NHS, as doctors and nurses,” she says. “My mum is retired, but still helping out in a care home. As technologists, we’re problem-solvers – we try to work around the issue, and find a way to do things. For instance, we’ve got two large-scale laser cutters at our school, which meant we could cut quite a bit in a short scale of time, and some places have used D printers – so you work to the best ability that you’ve got.”Teamwork is at the heart of this story, too. This is about colleagues and collaborators, from dedicated DT teachers to suppliers who donate materials free of charge.“Social media has mobilised our effort, on a national scale,” says Sandra. “Where there is surplus, we’ll try to logistically pass it around the network across Britain. Seeing the sheer numbers of what people have done and contributed – that’s when it hits home how amazing this is.“As a teacher, this is a small thing I can do, so that someone who’s potentially putting their le at risk can go into a safer situation at work, and do something big. Everyone is working together for that common goal. It goes to show how much we love the NHS, and how much we want to step out to support them.”Big-hearted Brits are making a dference to other people’s lives every day in this time of crisis – and sometimes it’s the little things that mean the most.Five-year-old Lucy Dawson has been busy delivering handmade paper flowers to her neighbours in Fakenham in Norfolk – leaving them with a note on their doorsteps in the hope of raising a smile and lting people’s spirits during the lockdown.“I learnt to make the paper flowers at my breakfast and after-school club before the lockdown. I wanted to cheer people up,” Lucy says.Her parents, Shelley, , and Marc, , couldn’t be prouder of their daughter, who’s received chocolate and cards from grateful neighbours.Lucy says: “I felt happy and proud that I helped to cheer people up. It gave me happy tears.”Mum Shelley says: “Lucy is creative and loves crafting. She suggested leaving the flowers on doorsteps with a note as a little surprise.”For many neighbours, locked down until the coronavirus has passed, a surprise gt has been the highlight of their day.Lucy and her mum have been careful to observe social distancing and to make the doorstep deliveries during their daily exercise session, using plenty of hand sanitising gel along the way.Shelley says: “She’s a caring little girl. Her grandad Andrew, who’s , lives next door and we can’t see him at the moment. So she leaves handmade gts on his doorstep because she misses him so much.”One note from a neighbour was wrapped around a chocolate bar, and said: “This is just a little thank you from us, it made us smile and we really needed that today.”Dad Marc adds: “We’re extremely proud of what Lucy has done for her neighbours. The look on her face when she received the thank you gts and notes is something me and Shelley will never forget.”A neighbour who works as an AE nurse in King’s Lynn was especially touched when she discovered Lucy’s flowers on her doorstep. She and her family wrote a note of thanks.The Dawsons needed something to feel good about. Shelley was meant to start a new job as a commercial property manager this month but it fell through because of the coronavirus crisis, while Marc has been furloughed from his job as a mechanical supervisor.“We’re busy home schooling and trying to keep Lucy busy,” he says. “She’s an only child and I think she’s getting a bit bored! She misses her friends but she’s working hard at her reading, writing and maths – and she and I love to play football in the garden.”The Dawsons are Norwich City fans, so they were delighted when Lucy won a Community Hero award from the club recently for her flower initiative.And she’s not stopping there. Lucy’s planning to leave handmade cards on neighbours’ doorsteps next.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can see the owner trying to pull back on the cord and he pulls the monkey while it hangs on to the kid, and in the start yanking the cord to propel the bike.Once the theory was shared, users flooded the comments section.One remorseful watcher wrote: Wow, I just rewatched it, and, yes, I absolutely saw the cord. Gross! So that sort of explains why the other guy was filming...he was the “training” session.

An airstrip was bulldozed last year to build a horse riding track, while a boathouse nearby shelters Kim’s Princess  luxury yacht, valued at around  million in .Details of his waterpark were also revealed in a rare sketch done by Italian chef Ermanno Furlanis, who worked in Pyong-Yang for the dictator in .Former dictator Kim Jong-Il was often seen at the aquatic park with girls often spotted leaving the luxury barge in a boat.Chef Furlanis, who worked in North Korea for  days, said he had managed to catch glimpses of the barge despite authorities often turning his head so he could not see certain areas of the barge.He told The Sun four years ago: “I think it was for training of the swimmers. The athletes are held in great honour in the country.“They were young athletes, swimmers or basketers.”But he said he also believed the barge was used for “amusement” as well.The experienced chef, who has worked all over the globe, said: “ also some young girl, I saw two, one time the yacht of Kim Il Sung arrived from there.”He said he could not see the detail of the floating park as it wasnt near the kitchen.Cooking for Kim Jung-Il, the leader of North Korea in the late s, the chef said the structure featured a landing bay for smaller boats as well as three floors of accommodation, a guard tower and a waterslide into a pool.The rare sketch revealed that the aquatic park was mobile, moving through the hundreds of islands near the base.From his vantage point of the kitchens, Furlanis said he could see a guard tower on either side of the pool while there were rooms where people could stay and enjoy themselves.The chef said he enjoyed his time working there, telling The Sun: “They have been very polite and gentle with us.”He also said the people were highly refined, and that they appreciated his meals.But he was unable to see much more of the barge or the dictator himself.The chef recalled being ordered to turn his head to avoid seeing Kims yacht arrive.Furlanis said: “I could not even stare at him, they turned myin the other direction.“Nobody could stare at him. It is sacred… like worship.”While the rest of the country was gripped by famine, Furlanis was commissioned along with several other chefs across the world to make international food for the tyrant.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

British journalism, in particular.What’s stopping you right now from falling off your perch in fits of laughter  Well, the fact that you’re currently digesting a work of journalism.This probably means that it’s an act – let’s call it that for now – which you’re used to committing on a fairly regular basis.Let’s also assume then that much of the information you gather, store and share comes from such journalistic sources.It’s likely you frequently form opinions and make decisions based on this content you consume.In fact, think really hard for a moment and try and imagine an area of your le where you haven’t been guided in some form by journalism.Buying a house, investing your savings, choosing a school, picking a holiday, deciding which box to put your cross in when you go into a polling booth .If you’re honest with yourself, you tend to make most of those decisions after you’ve digested the array of journalism available to you. And let’s also admit, disregarded too.Some of it is opinion led, some is impartial. You might not agree with all of it, and sometimes you might get ruddy cross at a paper or commentator that doesn’t chime with your world view.But together, the many erse components of British journalism create something which is profoundly valuable.The Covid- pandemic has tested our society to the limit. In the midst of a national crisis, journalists have been putting their lives at risk to keep you informed.News outlets have faithfully broadcast public health announcements – but also held our political leaders to account.The Downing Street daily conference has become a household staple, with ministerial interrogation by the press corps regularly influencing government policy.Without such probing questions and front page splashes, would you have known about the dearth of PPE or the crisis in our care homes Journalism, from local to national level, has connected communities in a way that social networks can only dream of. We have celebrated triumph in the face of adversity – and also documented tributes from the tens of thousands who have lost loved ones.But now we come to the rub.With the country under lockdown, British journalism is facing the biggest threat in its storied history.For newspapers, sales have dramatically fallen. For broadcasters and online outlets, advertising has gone through the floor even whilst audience numbers have risen.Yes, journalism joins one of many industries in financial peril right now.The work of reporters should be held up to scrutiny like any other profession. But we also need to acknowledge the sacrices its practitioners are making to keep the public informed.Everything that journalism hands to you doesn’t come for free.I’m sure that when you think about this properly, in a way you might never have done before, it really is needed more than everWe have to safeguard journalism. It is far too important to discard because it isn’t worth contemplating what the world would look likequality journalism didn’t exist.I don’t need to urge you to buy a paper or take up an online subscription, but I want you to tell everyone you meet that our sector is under a very real and present threat.I am the CEO of the Journalists’ Charity. It was founded in  by Charles Dickens and a group of parliamentary reporters – naturally in a pub.Our core mission to this day remains the same: to bring aid to journalists and their dependents who have fallen on hard times.We are stepping up to the mark, helping those in need with emergency funding and practical and emotional support.It’s why we’ve launched a #supportjournalism campaign in print and on social media.For me, a lockdown without journalists would be unthinkable.That’s why the Journalists’ Charity is standing four-square behind our industry when it needs us most. But we also need you to do your bit too.The Journalists’ Charity has been helping journalists through tough times for more than  years.

I described the findings and asked his guidance.Richard said: The whole area before then was a large hill called Windridge Hill for obvious reasons.This was quarried away to almost high tide level, then the houses when built into the hole with cellars, undercrofts etc.However these early cellars, this one looks to be for coal, were built out not only underneath the pavement but out into the road.The load on the roads would have been much lighter than now.I have seen these places turned into wine cellars, a place to grow mushrooms, andbig enough, a grotto type bathing area..."},{"url":null,"title":"joe wicks lockdown jamie oliver","story":"RIGHT then, Joe Wicks. He’s just Jamie Oliver with a skipping rope, I assumed, before this wretched lockdown business began.A character we’ve all seen in our local park, with a pair of boxing gloves and a stopwatch, charging financial managers £ a haemorrhoid to do some sit-ups over by the ornamental lake.One of Britain’s ever-growing army of personal trainers who,he wasn’t bouncing around on YouTube every morning, would be clogging up Love Island or Ex On The Beach.That’s what I thought, anyway.Then the coronavirus hit, the local swimming pool shut, the man became a phenomenon and before I could come to my senses, Joe and his infernal timing device were beeping away in my living room, every morning, as I joined in his PE lesson. Inevitably, it didn’t last.First, Joe’s routine did me what I can only describe as “a mischief”.Then, one morning, aged , I caught sight of myself, in a picture frame, doing his “reverse frog shuffle” and thought: “Stuff this for type two diabetes. I’m out.”I’d got no closer to understanding Joe’s astonishing popularity, though, which is truly global.Over , people log in just to stare at his fairly spartan living room, every Monday to Friday.Hundreds of thousands more appear when Joe starts his  minutes of physical jerks.So, in an attempt to unlock the greatest mystery of the outbreak, I kept watching Joe and swtly came to the conclusion success was not linked to his presenting skills.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Nah, only joking.”The jokes need to go the same way as the viewers’ poems, in honour of Joe, which he was actually reading out loud, until modesty finally prevailed.Much safer ground is the “spot the dference” competition, which borders on insulting, when he’s merely placed his wall atlas upside down or swapped his electric guitar for a ukulele, but does hint at the drive, ambition and ego behind the man.One day he replaced the atlas with a picture of himself, the next with a picture of his “other house” in Los Angeles and suddenly the penny dropped.Joe’s loaded and his head is not just on its way to Hollywood, it’s already there, making movies and doing squat thrusts with Gwyneth and Brad.The weird thing is, in other presenters, soap actors or comedians, I’d roll my eyes at the folly.With Joe Wicks, I don’t. ’Cos I can’t help it, I quite like him.Part of that may be linked to his no-frills background and a level of personal generosity that’s way beyond most of us .But I like to think it’s got more to do with the fact that, at a time when other cynical, doom-mongering TV hosts are desperately trying to read the public mood, reinvent themselves and force their agenda on viewers, Joe Wicks is just doing what he’s always done. Sit-ups.He may not be Emily Maitlis , but he’s the irrepressible and lucky optimist telling us to get off our fat a***s when we need to hear it most.He’s temporarily indisposed at the moment, of course.A gammy arm means we Rosie is leading the workouts.But I was firmly of the opinion nothing and no one could ever stand in the way of world domination, until I tuned into Sunday night’s Diva On Lockdown and there was Gemma Collins trying to contort her mighty bulk into one of Joe’s squats while she bellowed: “I wonder how Joe Wicks would feelhe knew the GC was doing his workout ”Beaten, I’d imagine.He must never know.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.And her face is glued to the back of her head.So there will be hell to payit comes unstuck on The Real Marigold Hotel, where the only other one of the eight celebs who’s appeared looking as unearthly as Britt is former Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, whose hair is now a “vibrant and colourful” shade of roast papaya orange.

Yellow and black tape will tell people where to stand in lts.One-way systems will be the norm in offices and on train s and at bus stops.Face-to-face meetings will only be able to go aheadabsolutely necessary and be time-limited.Employees will even be told not to share stationary such as pens.The message to employers is to allow their staff to work from homethey’re not needed in the workplace.It means home-working will likely become the default for millions of Brits for the foreseeable future.But employers will have to monitor the well-being of staff working from home by keeping in touch to ask about their welfare, physical health and personal security.The Government has told industry groups the new measures will have to be in place for between six and  months.They were told there will be a “gradual winding down” after the winter, The Sun has learnt.It is understood the y timeframe has been influenced by growing fears among the Government’s medical advisers that the coronavirus is seasonal.An industry source said: “If it survives the winter, these measures will have to be in place longer.”But one positive industry bosses are drawing from the new measures is the impact it will have on dampening traditional flu.The draft papers cover seven dferent settings: offices, hotel and restaurants, shops, factories, outdoor workplaces and those who work in vehicles and other people’s homes.Staggered sht times, less sharing of equipment and continued maximisation of home working are among a number of ideas listed as part of a draft government strategy to help businesses prepare for ato work.Increased hygiene procedures and the installation of protective screens are also included in the plan.Efforts to avoid employees working face-to-face will see them working side by side or facing away from each other, according to the plans leaked to Buzzfeed News.There will be limits on the number of people in stores so Brits will be asked to shop alone to enable shops to be allowed to open and kick-start the economy.The advice for reopening non-essential shops such as clothes stores will be similar to the supermarket rules.Tape setting out two metre distances will have to be put on shop floors, and Brits will need to queue outside.Many shops will go cashless to stop the spread of the virus through money.In cities like London, maintaining the two-metre rule would make it impossible for workplaces to operate anywhere near full capacity.Platforms and bus stops will contain two metre markers to maintain social distancing and one-way systems will be in place.A complex blueprint for schools to open in waves of dferent age groups is being planned.Reopening primary schools is a priority for the Government in order to minimise the threat to early years development and help parentsto work. But Year  pupils will be first backthey are forced to stagger the reopening dates as they are at the most crucial stage of their learning.PM Boris Johnson wants the first schools to reopen on June .Year  and  pupils are expected to be the first wave of secondary schools to open.No firm date has been set for reopening workplaces but The Sun revealed last week that May  has been pencilled in as a target date as long as the Government’s five tests for lting the lockdown measures are met by then.Mr Johnson will publish a “roadmap” strategy on Sunday, detailing exactly how restrictions will be eased in order for Brits to safelyto work.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said measures such as shields, masks and limiting the amount of contact time with colleagues could be alternative approaches taken by employers.But the draft guidance did not contain details about what personal protective equipment staff should wear when theyto work.The Trades Union Congress refused to support the plans as they stand, saying they “fall far short of giving any guarantees to workers about their health and safety”.Ministers confirmed that the Government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.Scotland boss Nicola Sturgeon revealed she shares Boris Johnsons hopes of being able to start easing the coronavirus lockdown towards the end of May.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a big dference between the . million shielded people, known as extremely critically vulnerable, who have been sent a letter advising them to shield for  weeks, vulnerable people with pre-existing health conditions of any age, and healthy over-s.This needs to be made clearer – you cant just have a blanket over-s group. Thats unsustainable. Its not a static group.The minister added: There arent enough supermarket delivery slots to cater for that amount of people.What we are going to see is more self-selection and personal responsibility.People will self-select whether they are vulnerable or not. The over-s are a very sensible group – by and large, they knowthey should be staying indoors or not.Meanwhile Tory Sir Graham Brady said on Monday night: We have today the most healthiest, active elderly generation of all time and it would be tragicGovernment threatened this by trying to extend a so-called lockdown for those judged to be most at risk based on age.Why dont we just give them the best information and advice and let them limit their risk themselves In the original Government guidance, anyone over , regardless of their state of health, was advised to be particularly stringent in following social distancing measures.But on May , that was withdrawn and replaced with new advice which listed all over-s as clinically vulnerable.Amid confusion over the guidelines, Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted: The clinically vulnerable, who are advised to stay in lockdown for  weeks, emphatically DO NOT include all over-s.The Department of Health and Social Care confirmed over s are not included in the most at risk group , who have been told to isolate for  weeks.On Monday, the Prime Ministers official spokesman said: Over-s are classed as being in the clinically vulnerable group – they are not necessarily in the clinically extremely vulnerable group, which are those people who are shielding.Therefore the advice to them is to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their household.Asked whether the over-s would have dferent rules from other sections of the population, the spokesman added: We know that, as you get older, there is a higher risk of coronavirus having a more serious impact. Complications and deaths are more common in the elderly, even those without pre-existing conditions.But as we look forward it is perfectly reasonable that we will look at how guidance will apply for dferent age bands, and we will continue to be guided by the science.The UK coronavirus death toll hit , on Monday as another  patients died in the lowest rise in more than a month.The last time the UK recorded such a low  hour fatality rate was almost five weeks ago on March  when  deaths were reported.However there is often a drop in Mondays figures due to a lag in reporting over the weekend with Tuesdays number likely to be higher.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Year  pupils will be first backthey are forced to stagger the reopening dates as they are at the most crucial stage of their learning.PM Boris Johnson wants the first schools to reopen on June .Year  and  pupils are expected to be the first wave of secondary schools to open.No firm date has been set for reopening workplaces but The Sun revealed last week that May  has been pencilled in as a target date as long as the Government’s five tests for lting the lockdown measures are met by then.Mr Johnson will publish a “roadmap” strategy on Sunday, detailing exactly how restrictions will be eased in order for Brits to safelyto work.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said measures such as shields, masks and limiting the amount of contact time with colleagues could be alternative approaches taken by employers.But the draft guidance did not contain details about what personal protective equipment staff should wear when theyto work.The Trades Union Congress refused to support the plans as they stand, saying they “fall far short of giving any guarantees to workers about their health and safety”.Ministers confirmed that the Government has started stockpiling face masks for public use.Scotland boss Nicola Sturgeon revealed she shares Boris Johnsons hopes of being able to start easing the coronavirus lockdown towards the end of May. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Dr Lim admits that the sample is a “drop in the bucket” when it comes to the ious sequences of the virus being displayed. He saidmore coronavirus genomes are sequenced then scientists might find more instances of attenuated genome.The development in Arizona comes after a team from the University of Dundees School of Le Sciences released some of the clearest pictures yet recorded of the virus.They show the formation of Sars-CoV- particles - the virus which causes Covid- - in a tissue model of the human gut viewed in an ultra-powerful microscope.Each of the images is greater than - GBytes – which is  to , times larger than an image recorded on an iPhone.They also show the virus assembling and leaving human intestinal cells.Scientists from the University of Dundees School of Le Sciences worked alongside the Hubrecht Institute in Utrecht, the Erasmus MC University Medical Centre in Rotterdam and Maastricht University in the Netherlands to isolate the pictures.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is some science on droplet spread from people that have been done in the past, but they’re not conclusive.If we have lockdown,we have an app to identy people that have infection and people obey it,people continue to do that, and people self-isolatethey have symptoms, there will be no problem. But workplaces do need some form of closeness together – not less than one meter, but certainly two meters.”Social distancing was implemented by the government in March. Officials advised that people stay two metres away from each other in order to stop the spread of the virus.By reducing the amount of times people come into contact with one another it is believed that this can help prevent the spread of contagious diseases such as the coronavirus.The measures are in place in supermarkets up and down the country and also apply to offices that have remained open during the pandemic.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We dont know that it provides absolute immunity and it almost certainly doesnt - it will provide some degree of protection.The other thing we dont know is whether it is still possible to carry the virus evenyou have got antibodies.So that is more about whether you can still be infectious to someone  rather than whether you are protected against it.Based on the lespan of other viruses he said that the time frame for immunity may last from one to three years, but not for many years.Levels of infection from the coronavirus dfer from county to county in the UK with places like densely populated cities like London being one of the worst affected areas as well as other regions such as the North West also having high case rates.Sir Patrick also added that current information the government holds is on antibody status rather than how people develop immunity from the illness.He went on to explain that there would be a iation in levels of antibodies across the country and said there is around  per cent antibody positivity in London, whereas other places come in at around four per cent.Sir Patrick reiterated that current knowledge is around antibody status rather than immunity, and explained there will be a iation in the levels of antibodies across the country.He said he would not expect to see antibody levels much above mid-teens.Early on in the coronavirus pandemic it was revealed that the government had previously discussed locking London down first in order to curb the spread of the virus.Askedantibody data would mean each UK region was treated in the same way, he said there was nothing to suggest that you should treat dferent regions dferently.There may be other reasons such as local prevalence but as I said that comes with complexities. In terms of the vulnerability of the population, you would need to get to higher levels than that suggests that one place had a massively dferent protective environment to somewhere  from the population antibody, and we dont yet know exactly how much protection the antibody status gives.His comments at the committee today come after Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van Tam last night said that the early evidence showed by and large Covid- sufferers are developing antibodies to the virus, he did however reiterate that it did not show whether or not they were immune from the virus.Speaking at the Number  daily press briefing last night he said: One of the things we want to know is - when youve had Covid- do you get antibodies, do they protect you against further instances of the same illness, and how long are they going to protect you for So far tests have shown the overwhelming majority of people whove had definitely had the Covid- infection have got antibodies in their blood stream, which is a good thing, he explained.Ultimately, he said that it may take years for scientists to get enough data to conclusively determine how long antibodies last.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some , tests were ‘provided’ in the  hours to am on Monday - well below the daily target set for the end of last month by Health Secretary Matt Hancock. The government admitted on Sunday that it had not hit the target - with just , performed in the previous day.  Cabinet minister Michael Gove told the daily No press conference: You might expect over a weekend, with fewer people going to work, that you might have a dip in the amount testing that might occur at that time.I don’t think it in any way detracts from the amazing achievement of the NHS and others in so signicantly increasing the amount of tests that are available.

Ministers claimed victory on passing Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s , a day target on Friday, despite counting tens of thousands of tests which had only sent out by courier, not analysed by labs.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the governmentaposs chief scientic advisor, told the Parliamentary Health and Social Care Committee today: I can tell you that a second peak is something that is very real, that you need to watch out for, and you can see it in other countries. More than , lives have been lost to Covid- in the UK to date with that figure expected to continue to rise over the coming days and weeks. There are fears that a rapid easing of lockdown measures could lead to the virus spiking once again and a risk the NHS could be overwhelmed leading to tens of thousands more deaths.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror emailSir Patrick was asked whether there is a risk of a second wave hitting the UK when peoplefrom other countries, especially those that have not had their peak yet. He said a calculation had been done around three weeks ago on the likely impact of imported cases in terms of the total number of cases of the virus in the UK. He said: At that point, when you took all of the travel and you took all of the numbers coming in, it would have been something under .% of all the cases would have come in through imports. Now clearly that equation reverses when you get down to very low numbers in your own country and you have higher numbers where, and thataposs when you need to be vigilant on how you think about isolation and testing of cases coming in. But, again, this is a pandemic, it means itaposs everywhere, and therefore cases can come from anywhere in the world. Asked about the likelihood of a second wave, Sir Patrick said: I thinkwe do test, track and tracing well, and we keep the social distancing measures at the right level, we should be able to avoid a second wave. However, he said he wanted to add one caveat which is winter is going to be extremely dficult when you also have flu circulating, and you have all the other respiratory infection.  Sir Patrick today said the R number - the number of people infected by each Covid- carrier - is . to . but lower in London. That is down from something close to  in the early stages of the pandemic and means the virus is not spreading exponentially. Yet he warned we are still quite early in the epidemic and it doesnapost mean the whole thingaposs gone away. Sir Patrick said the vast majority of people who’ve had coronavirus get some form of antibody response - but this does not mean theyaposre immune.  He said: An antibody response is likely in most people to provide some form of immune protection. But how much we don’t know. Experience from other coronaviruses suggests it may last for one, two, three years but not many many years. Sir Patrick warned no measures easing the lockdown will be completely safe. He told MPs: “Nothing is going to be risk-free. Everything as we go back to less social distancing will carry a risk of there being an outbreak somewhere or a few more cases or in worst case scenario, R goes above . We need a very effective surveillance system to pick that up.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror government must redeem","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Government must redeem itself by finally copying other nations successesAs Italy goes back to work and UK is poised to overtake it as registering the highest death rate in Europe, the hope is we can emerge a politer, kinder country, valuing key workers and each otherShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video matt-hancock-unveils-next-steps-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics voice-mirror-government-must-redeem-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jake Brown was doing some work at his newly bought home when he realised that one wall had dferent textures. He inspected further and made an opening big enough to get his head through to take another look. To his shock, Jake discovered there was a huge area underneath his home in Plymouth, Devon, so he opened it up to investigate.Inside the tunnel he discovered items including paint cans and an old newspaper that proved the tunnel had been blocked up for more than  years, the Plymouth Herald reports.And he found evidence on bottles that the tunnel itself was from the early s. Jake said: “While having a lazy coffee standing outside the basement front door of the property I noticed a patch in the wall of a texture dferent to the rest. “I also noted that the patch was the same distance from the coal cellar already exposed, currently used for storage. “Curiosity and a little boredom got the better of me, after which I grabbed a drill and began working pilot viewing holes into the wall.  “Once I had made two holes, one for viewing, one for a torch, I peered through into the dark dusty expanse and realised that it was another cavern of sorts. After realising what was beneath his house, Jake opened the wall up so that he could climb down and walk inside. He added: I proceeded to hammer out a larger opening through which I could get a better idea of the space, andI should carry on making mess. “Upon creating a large enough hole to fit through, I shone a torch into the dark, revealing the larger than expected space before me. “The cavern had a lot of builders waste from another era, so I climbed inside to explore and take a closer look.  He soon realised the area was bigger than he had expected. Jake added: I measured the rough area of the space and observed its structural integrity. “I was pleased to note that the stone arched ceiling was in great condition and the expanse measured a healthy m deep, m high, and m wide. In the area, Jake found piles of building waste and other rubbish, so started digging through it all for clues. “Upon inspection it confirmed that the space had been covered up for many years.  “It had been used as an easy space, to hide the waste from renovating the property’s roof, guttering, doors, and windows many years ago before being covered up. “As I moved deeper into the cavern I began to search for evidence that would tie it to a grouping of years so as I could more accurately determine how long it had been covered up. “In the dark I collected bottles, paint cans, and my golden find was the remains of a newspaper, though was more comparable to mushy silt. After an arduous process of preparing the newspaper in a bath filled with water, Jake was finally able to open a few pages in search of a date. He added: “I laid the items I had collected out in the clear light to identy their age. “The paint cans were extremely degraded but had enough detail to show that the labelling was of a s s era style. “The bottles, after a quick wipe, were etched with detailing common also of the early s. “The biggest reveal was the newspaper, it almost disintegrated upon human touch, so a CSI style method was used to carefully peel back the congealed layers. “I proceeded to run a warm bath and soaked the congealed brown mess in the solution for a period of time, after which tweezers and vibration were used to slowly work shards of the paper free while submerged. “After as many fragments of the paper had been recovered as possible, I photographed while still submerged and removed what was salvageable for drying. “I scanned through the jumbled pieces looking for dates or usable information to determine the era. “There were little hints the style of writing, no colour, picture style, currency and then finally a date! “What was barely readable was the year , this along with the other pieces of evidence fitted, meaning the cellar had been blocked up for over  years.

Oscar Jealous was diagnosed just before lockdown with Battenaposs Disease, a cruel neurodegenerative illness that afflicts only a handful of children every year. It has been described as a childhood form of dementia because it gradually robs youngsters of the ability to speak, swallow and see, and also causes epilepsy and memory loss. Parents Alex and Dani Jealous from the Great Barr area of Birmingham, say they are heartbroken but determined to fill every moment of Oscaraposs le with joy - with a little help from their family and friends. Together they have launched a bucket list, with encounters with Sooty and Sweep, footballer Harry Kane, Santa Claus and racing driver Lewis Hamilton, a visit to the Tipping Point TV studio, and the chance to be a policeman and a fireman getting top billing. Launched on Sunday evening, the family has already been overwhelmed with love. Twelve wishes have been pledged already, while donors have given more than £, towards a wishes cash pot. Dad Alex, a -year-old heating engineer, said: People have been incredibly kind. Itaposs been surreal and we are still trying to process it all.  The fact we have been in lockdown pretty much since knowing, has actually given us a precious time to be together as a family and now we feel we are ready to share our story, but it has also made us take a big gulp, realising this is really happening. Oscar was diagnosed with autism and ADHD previously, and is gradually losing his sight - all conditions his family originally thought were separate but are actually signs of the disease. He is starting to experience dficulties with swallowing so will soon undergo an operation to fit a feeding tube. In a video message, mum Dani joins Alex to explain the awful moment they found out what was wrong with their aposbeautul Oscar.apos Itaposs a neurological disorder that affects the brain. Childhood dementia is what they said to us...that day, knowing those things were going to happen, our world ended. Or it felt like our world ended. It was crushing. At the end of it I asked them the question: aposwill he die from this apos They answered me aposyesapos. I wasnapost expecting them to say yes...I thought they would say no, we will just deal with it, his le will be dferent...but they said yes. Then the next question was: aposhow long.apos Bear in mind Oscar is eight now. They said he may make it to his early teens. No parent should hear those words, says Dani. Keeping a blog and sharing videos of their experiences with the world is cathartic for them both, said Alex. We are finding it is helping us deal with everything. We want to continue this and create a legacy for Oscar. If it can also help anyone  finding things dficult, that will be greatwe can bring a little bit of Oscar, a ray of sunshine, into peopleaposs lives thataposs what we will do.  We are trying to live in the moment, and not look too far ahead. This is helping us enormously. Dani added: We know how loved Oscar is...he walks into a room and has a huge impact on everyone - we want to share our highs and lows and memory making. We donapost have loads of time with Oscar but the time we do have, it has to be positive and fun and make memories.A Gofundme page has been launched by the family to help cover the costs of adventures, alongside the bucket list of moments that money canapost buy. Aunties Danne and Laura, who set it up, said of their nephew: Oscar doesn’t know the outcome of the recent diagnosis but I’m sure his reaction would be the same as every other obstacle he has had to face - to not complain at all, and just crack on with le. We can count on one hand the number of times we have heard Oscar complain about anything. A cousin of his once used the expression aposBe More Oscar’ when describing how we should all look at le in a positive, upbeat way, the way Oscar does, and this couldn’t be more fitting. Alex, who runs his own heating company Strysen Heating Ltd in Sutton Coldfield, said: We have created the list, with input from Oscar. Because of his autism he tends to develop obsessions with certain people - so any mention of football he asks about Harry Kane, is Harry Kane playing...itaposs also why the idea of him and his little brother being mascots for England would be so amazing.    Lewis Hamilton is his favourite as he loves the noise and the cars going round and round the track, he finds it calming. And he adores Tipping Point, he pretends he is a contestant and has pretend conversations with  Ben Shephard , and he has very strong opinions about game playing etiquette and whether or not people should take the offer at the end. We also always wanted to take him to Florida before he lost his mobility and speech.

Lynda, , is a retired nurse from Batley in Yorkshire, while Jovan is a -year-old politics student from West Bromwich. Yet both of their lives have been upended by the coronavirus. While Lynda’s health problems mean she is shielding at home and receiving food parcels, Jovan has been forced to come home from university and is volunteering in the community. This week, we asked Lynda and Jovan to be the first participants in a ground-breaking new project, Britain Connects – launched today by the Daily Mirror and . A year after we pioneered Britain Talks, which was aimed at getting the UK chatting across the Brexit ide, this is a new virtual version. This time we want to build on the new connections forming across Britain as we face the Covid- pandemic together. “Jovan is a lovely young man,” Lynda says, after the pair connect via Zoom, chatting for almost two hours. “It felt like we really did know each other straight away. I’d love to go out for a cup of tea with him when the lockdown is over. On paper, we seem dferent - we voted dferently in the election - but we share a lot of the same values.” Jovan agrees. “I would have never spoken to someone like Lynda in my normal le,” he says. “We just wouldn’t have met and politically we seem very dferent, but we had a lot in common..”  The Daily Mirror asked the pair to meet up for a virtual chat, as our country reaches a moment of peak isolation. Lynda, new to modern tech ‘whatnot’, chats from the living room of her flat in Batley Carr. Jovan, a digital native, is in his childhood bedroom in the Midlands with his guitar. Our readers up and down the country are overcoming isolation by connecting with people they wouldnapost usually meet for an online chat. Do you want to join them YES IaposM IN Lynda thinks the Prime Minister is doing a reasonable job, “the best of a bad lot” who will “get Brexit done”. Jovan is a Labour supporter who “did everything in my power to stop Boris being elected” and voted Remain. Born  years apart, Lynda’s biggest fear is of catching Covid-, while Jovan worries far more about what comes next for his already-struggling generation.But, as they chat, they discover they both come from NHS families. Jovan’s grandmother came to Britain from Ghana in the s to work in the health service as a midwe. His mum is now a matron at Birmingham City Hospital. “She’s at the hospital right now,” Jovan says, “on the frontline. We’re very proud of her.” Lynda’s dad was a pharmacist from Wallasey, as well as a navigator in the RAF during the war. And it even turns out Lynda, a former theatre and paediatric nurse, was a matron herself too. “I was nursing for  years,” she says. “Twice my letime,” Jovan laughs. “I retired two years ago otherwise I would have been on the frontline myself,” Lynda says. “You know what it’s like, mum’s in there all hours,” Jovan says. “On her day off yesterday she was called out and was there for the whole day.” While Lynda voted Conservative and Jovan is an active member of the Labour Party, both are upset by the lack of PPE for frontline workers. Lynda previously ran a care home and is especially worried for carers. Jovan worries for his mum and her colleagues.  “My mum said one of her staff members had to go in with a motorbike crash helmet because they didn’t have enough PPE,” Jovan says. Lynda nods. “I was screaming at the TV news. I could see what was going to happen and I couldn’t do anything about it.” Jovan says: “I hope this is a  moment where people say there’s been a particular way of doing things that hasn’t really worked… so we need to fund things, we need to treat people with more dignity and respect.” Lynda nods: “Exactly.” For Britain Connects, the Mirror and Express are also partnering with the Behavioural Insights Team. “The coronavirus crisis has created a shared experience without precedent for all of us,” Antonio da Silva says. “This unique situation also means that while we adjust to the pandemic there is an opportunity to connect and bring people closer together as never before. “We will draw on evidence from behavioural science to help make that contact as fruitful as possible and in the process learn more about bridging ides between people.” It turns out Jovan and Lynda share many interests. Born in Liverpool, Lynda talks about nights spent as a student nurse at the famous Cavern Club, watching the Beatles. Jovan plays bass in the Themselves Houseband, as part of a collective that organises arts events in London. “I went to school with Paul McCartney and John Lennon, that’s my only claim to fame…” Lynda says. “I think that’s cooler than anything I could ever say!” Jovan laughs. Jovan is a keen cyclist and is amazed when Lynda produces her exercise bike. “It keeps my legs exercising while I watch the telly,” she says. “I do  pedals a few times a day. That’s more cycling than you today Jovan…” While Lynda is living off hot cross buns and prosecco brought round by a neighbour’s son, Jovan is desperately missing trips to the pub. They say they are both “living like students”, staying up late in front of the TV. They both wish they could get to the hairdresser, and Lynda teases Jovan for hiding his lockdown locks under a back-to-front baseball cap.

Bea Levache from Kent, redecorated her homeaposs utility room, the stairs, the office as well as designing a feature wall at a cost of just £. Proud mum Susie Levache, , said the -year-old developed her DIY skills, including using a power drill and a handsaw, and was ‘a natural’ who did a ‘blinding job’. The portrait photographer shared before and after photos on Facebook - to which she received thousands of responses. Susie and Bea’s brother Ted, , also lent a hand, and the family aimed to reuse as much as possible, so only needed to buy a few extra items from eBay for the projects. Writing about the home office transformation, she said: I usually tackle all the DIY projects alone but my -year-old daughter took an interest and actually I figured I had a lot of time on my hands to recty anything she might damage. Turns out after telling her to just go for it - she’s a natural and did a blinding job-with direction she did this herself. She was VERY handy with a handsaw We just used some thin MDF strips, paint and a roll of wallpaper to transform my office. Susie added: I supervised and told her how to use the spirit level and how to measure and cut the MDF strips we had.  She was really nervous to begin with as she was worried that she would mess up. The room was gloomy and hadn’t really been used properly for ages anyway so she had nothing to lose - then there was no stopping her! This gave her the confidence to just go for it and after the first two  she then did the rest alone. Susie watched as Bea successfully marked, leveled, glued, pinned and added a dado rail before filing the room ready for painting. The office ling took just a few hours to do and the following day to paint.  Susie said she had been steadily renovating the family’s s semi-detached house for  months, and decided to use the time at home to give the plans a boost. She homeschools Bea and Ted in the mornings, but after week two of lockdown, the children seemed ‘bored’, so she asked them to help with DIY projects in the afternoon. Susie said they have been as resourceful as possible during lockdown by using things, such as paint, that they already had in the shed and loft. The only purchase they’ve made during pandemic has been kitchen handles. After seeing how the new home office looked, Susie encouraged Bea to decorate the stairs with black ling using the assistance of her brother Ted - totally unsupervised.  She said: Then we used up some old tester pots I had to stencil and hand paint an accent wall in a funky animal print design. She had the patience of a saint for hand painting that job! Then the family moved onto the kitchen utility room makeover which had the floor completed before lockdown but still required a lot of work. Susie said: ‘The room was full of orange pine. I taught Bea how to use the drill and change the drill bits and how to use the little work bench. She filled the existing drawer holes, drilled new holes and put in dferent drawer pulls. They look fantastic! The whole room was then transformed with chalk paintso all of it including the handles came to about £ - we loved the end result.  Bea spent three days redecorating the room. Susie wrote about her achievement on Facebook in a post that was liked nearly , times. She shared: We had a grim aposdumping groundapos utility room to part renovate - I showed her how to use a power drill at the weekend . My daughter customised the fronts of the drawersthen we used leftover paint to repaint the cupboards. We also made little initial blackboard effect plaques from leftover mdf, paint and glue - then aged them for the laundry baskets.  As before,my  year old and I can do this - ANYONE can do this. The duo also used their DIY expertise to transform an old broken rattan table for the family’s dreamy outdoor terrace. Bea used leftover tiles to create a stunning mosaic on the table before placing the original glass on the top to finish. The tiles for the garden table were left over from previous tiling where the family had purchased the amount needed including spares for breakages and luckily, there was none.  Susie said: The table now has pride of place on our terrace. During lockdown, we have taken all the blankets out, sat by the fire and drank hot chocolate in the cosy haven. ‘It’s definitely a makeover we are proud of. It was probably around £somebody wanted to have a go at upcycling. It’s comforting that all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the planning, faffing and upkeep of the terrace garden - that it is enjoyed by everyone. Susie posted her DIY successes online and received hundreds of questions from parents wanting to do the same with their kids so she created an Instagram account dedicated to sharing her tips and decorating secrets.  She added: We have been staggered by the reaction. Some of the posts have had thousands of likes. We’ve also had some great messages from carpenters and builders lending advice which has been terric. Susie added that the family DIY projects havenapost just resulted in an incredible home transformation - it has also helped Bea’s confidence. She said: I was always a creative child and my daughter thought she didn’t have any skills before lockdown, I hope this will give her confidence that it’s all there. She just needed to believe she could do it!  Initially she was quite timid about using the power tools and things, but now she’s so proud of what she’s achieved. Pre-lockdown I would never have thought to include Bea in my work - this period has really shown me that children are far more capable than we may think. The family’s six-week complete ‘spring fling’ came after Susie decided to decorate the house. She revealed in a recent social media post: aposNo more white box. My husband has zero interest in DIY and interiors which leaves me in charge!

The cat then led her to a nearby shop - and more specically to the pet food aisle - and pointed at the meal he wanted. She said: He got in between our steps aswe were ignoring him, then I paid attention to him and it was when he first guided me to the pet food rack. And, she understood he was hungry.  Tania explained said that she had often seen him sneaking in the store with dferent people, and just assumed he belonged to one of the managers. But, upon speaking with them, they explained that the stray understood specic hours and often did this with customers hoping they would take pity and buy him food. Tania continued: Every time he came to the store, we greeted each other and did the same, he guided me to the shelf and chose the food he wanted.

But in  Amado Carrillo Fuentes died suddenly, killed by plastic surgery. The -year-old seemed fearless after seizing control of the Juarez drug cartel and became known as the aposLord of the Skiesapos after acquiring a huge fleet of jets to transport his narcotics. As well as being one of Mexicoaposs biggest drug dealers, Carrillo was also a prolic money launderer shting cash from Mexico to Columbia, which he used to finance his fleet of jets. The drugs trade was a family business for Carrillo, who learned how to become one of the most dangerous in Mexico at his uncleaposs knee. One of , Carrillo was clearly a favourite nephew of Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, who was better known as Don Neto and the leader of the Guadalajara cartel. He taught his nephew everything he knew about the drug trade, and Carrillo eventually recruited his brothers and even son into the family business. However, it wasnapost long before the family were paying the price for working in such a dangerous industry. Carrilloaposs father died in , followed by his brother, Cipriano Carrillo Fuentes, in mysterious circumstances three years later. Ruthless from an early age, Carrillo became boss of his own cartel by murdering its boss, Rafael Aguilar Guajardo. A deeply private man, Carrillo was rarely photographed. During his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico, Carrillo is said to have amassed a gigantic £billion fortune. But in the years leading up to his death, the net was starting to tighten around Carrillo as authorities upped their efforts to arrest him and dismantle his deadly empire. He was so afraid he was going to be caught, Carrillo came up with a plan to alter his appearance so dramatically, including liposuction, that he would never be recognised. It was a decision that cost him his le as he died while on the operating table in .Chillingly, the bodies of his surgeons were found some time later. They have been brutally tortured before they were killed and their bodies stuffed in oil barrells before concrete was poured over them Carrilloaposs brother, Vicente, is believed to have taken over his siblingaposs empire following his death and is currently awaiting trial in Mexico. Now, for the first time, Carrilloaposs luxury £.million villa, paid for with the spoils of his drug empire, has been sold and people can see inside the home of the man who was once Mexicoaposs most feared drug lord.  Cash from the sale, which was auctioned last weekend, will be given back to the Mexican people to try to repair some of the damage caused by Carrilloaposs reign of terror. The stunning home, which is in one of the best neighbourhoods, is surrounded by huge and lush gardens. In one corners stands an adorable stone playhouse, perfect for small children. There is an indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi, bar and even a wine cellar. The entrance to the home is by a sweeping drive with a huge courtyard, and while the kitchen now appears to be dated, in  it would have been state-of-the-art.

We had very limited time to look at things. The document itself didn’t give much hope for reconstruction and didn’t do a lot of things. For me, I wasn’t just thinking of Dundee Football Club but other clubs who would be hurt in all of this. That was my main focus – I didn’t want anybody to get hurt.The change came after a lot of conversations with a lot of clubs and the appetite for reconstruction was greater than I first thought. There are other things, which I don’t want to get into, but we were trying to help these clubs who were going to be hurting. I was trying to soften the blow for everybody but also trying to use the time [between the deadline and submitting the ‘yes’ vote] to make Scottish football, through reconstruction, a better overall product that has more value going forward. That’s something we have been discussing for a long time, but we have the time now to really dig in and look at it. Getting to that stage, we had over % of the clubs vote a certain way so, in order to get going, so to speak, I changed my vote so we could get on to the next phase.As far as the Premiership goes, all we did was vote to put it into the hands of the board. They now have in their hands the chance to say what they want to do with it. They can try to play [the remaining matches] later. There are options they will have to weigh. We weren’t weighing those options.GC: What went through your mind when you saw the incomplete vote had been published JN: I wasn’t best pleased. I know there was a statement saying: “We had to put something out because we had a board meeting,” but the statement could have been as simple as: “We have an incomplete vote, there is a statutory  days and we have not received every vote.” By the way, it wasn’t just our vote, there were others that weren’t received either. They could have said it was an incomplete vote without any detail and that would have been more appropriate in my opinion.GC: At that point, you have said you weren’t aware it was your vote that was missing, what did you think then JN: I don’t know what happened, I have no idea. What they say is it got caught in the spam folder, which you have to believe. We did intend to vote a certain way and then changed it after I had more information. I talked with a lot of people. I pace when I talk on the phone. The Saturday, I walked . miles while on the phone, mostly inside my house. I averaged over the period before I voted over  miles a day, just on the phone.GC: What was the major part of changing your vote JN: The biggest thing was, the only way I could see, once we knew what was happening, that we could help anybody – it’s not just helping people but a longer-term, bigger picture – is reconstruction. Speaking with a lot of clubs, there was much more of an appetite for reconstruction than I understood going into this. That was the main thing.GC: Can you understand why other people saw Dundee as the bad guy JN: Obviously, people think we have handed United the league, Rangers think we have handed Celtic the league, although that is in the hands of the board, which they have a representative on. Over % voted for it and it was going to happen one way or the other – we represent % of that vote, total. The only way going forward would be league reconstruction. Yeah, I can see why I am the bad guy, but  or % of the league are also that same bad guy. The league did, in putting it out there, put us in a bad position.GC: The WhatsApp messages . Did that influence your thought process JN: It’s unbelievable. The way that was handled was not businesslike and was very poor. It has caused a lot of bad blood throughout the league, the way that was done, taking private messages and putting them out there. Of course, they have been taken out of context at some levels because you don’t know exactly what was going on and what the conversations were. There were a lot of conversations going on at that time, loads of them, so you don’t get the full context of it but you do get one view and that’s what they wanted.GC: You mentioned ‘handing’ Dundee United the Championship. Did that come into the thinking at any point JN: Obviously as Dundee Football Club, we don’t want to hand our rivals anything but, at the end of the day, it was inevitable that was going to happen. I had several conversations with Mal [Brannigan, Dundee United managing director] throughout this, several conversations with Rangers, with Celtic, with Hearts, I’ve had conversations with quite a few people. You could tell early on that there would be promotion relegation and there was no way around it because over % of the clubs wanted that to happen. Whether or not we wanted that to happen, it was going to happen. I’m not going to make a decision based on what happens to United – I have to make the decision on what’s best for Dundee Football Club and what’s best for Scottish football.GC: To make it clear, what was the benefit to Dundee in changing your vote JN: We were in the worst position possible – we were in third place. There’s not much benefit one way or the other that we could get out of this. When people ask me that – I ask what do you think we could we have gotten out of this  So, the best thing we could possibly get out of this is a proper conversation about reconstruction. That might not benefit us in the short-term, but in the long-term, it would benefit Dundee FC and all of Scottish football. That, for me, was the best thing we could get out of this. Does that do anything for us right now  No. But we need to look at it in a much bigger, broader picture as opposed to: “What does it do for me right now ”GC: After the whole process, are you happy with the end result JN: I’m not happy with the overall process, I’m not happy with where we are, I’m not happy football clubs are losing money, I’m certainly not happy people are dying of coronavirus in the wider world. We still don’t know what is actually going to happen. All of this might be for nought, we might be shut down for a long, long time and be having much dferent conversations in the future. You can never be happy in these situations, just be pragmatic and get through it as best as we can.GC: Are you confident reconstruction is going to happen and benefit the game in the long-term JN: We are having good conversations. We have to jump through a load of hoops and we have  clubs we have to satisfy, on some level. For me, the most important thing in this is that Scottish football – and, in turn, Dundee Football Club – comes out with a product that is better than we currently have. Sky Sports and our media partners need to be a part of this, too, and help us understand exactly what it is going to take in order for us to be a more attractive product, a more saleable product. We want to be on TV, we want more people to come to games, we need to make games have more meaning, we have to do things that might be outside of the box to bring viewers to the table – that’s the angle I come at it from. I can’t talk to you about the specics of what the group is talking about because we are trying to work through all of these things but the principle, from my point of view, is we have to absolutely make it a more attractive proposition for fans and for viewers. There are ways of doing it.What I want to get out of it all is a product that is better that, in turn, brings more money in that, in turn, makes the product even better and it turns full circle. For me, that’s the goal. It’s a long-term vision but we have the time right now to pay attention to that and work through these things. It might end up this scenario ends up being a change-stage process, whenever we get started again, for  , and then reconstruction might start in  .GC: Do you have a preference for which way the league might be set up JN: I really can’t talk about that because of the [reconstruction working] group I am in. A lot of the setups have merits, a lot have issues but as long as whatever format is setup makes it more valuable, more interesting, then I would be open to just about any type of system. At the end of the day, the top tier brings in the most money and that’s where the eyes are but we have to be conscious of down the leagues, they rely more on gate than TV money, and we have to make sure those games are maintained or even enhanced in some way. It is a balancing act, it’s not as simple as just I like this one or that one.GC: How confident are you we might get consensus at the end of this JN: I don’t know. We have only had two meetings so far. There has been a lot of work gone into those meetings. I thinkwe get to a proposition where all clubs benefit financially, the pie actually grows rather than just cutting it up in dferent ways, you’d have a better chance of getting a consensus. If the goal makes the product better and eventually the product is worth more, that makes more sense –you just change for the sake of it, it doesn’t make much sense to me.GC: Do you see it being better to make a permanent change or a temporary one like was suggested in Hearts’ first statement after the reconstruction talks were announced JN: I don’t know, that’s the problem. I don’t think it’s as simple as we can make one big change right away. I think it might be something that phases in over time. But like I said, we have to have all the stakeholders talking in order to see what that means. We have to make sure all the contracts are being satisfied and these conversations take time. It might be that we have a staged-process but at this point, we are so early in the process, I don’t know what that would % look like. We are still working through all the iterations.GC: Getting all the stakeholders talking – has that been made more dficult by the way things have happened over the past few weeks JN: I think within the group, it’s been fine. Everybody is professional. Honestly, there has been no animosity on the phone calls. Any time we run through anything like this, tensions run high and people say things and do things. For the most part, it’s just business and forgivable and off you go. There may have been one or two things that were done that will be more dficult for people to let go but, hopefully, we can all focus for the proper greater good of the game. If we have a proposition that is best for everybody, I would hope we look at the proposition and not really consider anything ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee united chief mal brannigan leaves tannadice","story":"Dundee United have announced the departure of managing director Mal Brannigan.The former Sheffield United and Dundalk chief was appointed by Tangerines owner Mark Ogren in January  to take charge of day-to-day business operations.Alongside sporting director, Tony Asghar, and first team coach, Robbie Neilson, Brannigan helped steer United back to the Premiership this season.Much of his work was done in the background, however, he hit the headlines in recent days after insisting the club would be targeting trophies and European football upon theirto the top flight.The Tangerines also raised eyebrows in recent weeks by disowning a fan group – the Dundee United Supporters’ Foundation – after a row about a potential cash injection.In revealing Brannigan’s departure, United said: “Dundee United today confirm that managing director Mal Brannigan will leave his role with immediate effect.”Chairman, Mark Ogren, extended his appreciation to Brannigan for his contribution to the growth and success achieved by the club.He said:# Since taking over the club, we have seen extremely positive changes of which Mal has been at the forefront.#We would like to thank Mal for his work during his time as managing director and we wish him the very best.#Brannigan said: #It has been a huge pleasure to have been a part of Dundee United#sto the Scottish Premiership. I wish the club nothing but success.#I would like to thank Mark, Scottand the board for their support and guidance during my time at Tannadice.“I would also like to extend my gratitude to the staff at the club who have worked extremely hard to achieve our goals and to the supporters who care so much for their club.

After an unclear club statement that later emerged to be Dundee’s notice of submitting a ‘yes’ vote, some Dark Blues fans reacted angrily to the decision.Askedhe understood the feelings of the supporters, Nelms told the Tele: “Absolutely. I don’t ever really say which way I vote, I give principles of what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.“The last daywe did a holding statement saying we’re not going to make a statement until we actually do something and then the next statement came out because we actually did something and voted.“But, people didn’t realise that we actually voted. So, we had to put out another statement.“You know how I am, I don’t talk about players# contracts, I don’t do things like that because I don’t think it’s appropriate at the time because you are negotiating. You can’t do that in the public eye because it’s not beneficial for the football clubyou do it that way.“We talked about it and I could see why the fans were concerned.“Honestly, I’m not surethe fans can see it or not but we are doing whatever we can do for the best of the football club, always. Not once in a while, not when it suits, always.“We will make decisions that might not be popular among the fans in the short-term but overall in the long-term it will benefit the football club. That’s the way we will run the business and I don’t think we’ve done anything but that. I’ll take the heat for it and that comes with the territory.”The club haven’t had any match income for over seven weeks due to the coronavirus shutdown.Nelms says Dundee are in a “stable position” but accepts there is no way of knowing what the future might hold.“At the moment, the way we have the business set up, with insurances and the way the“It is a new reality. Our business has changed from getting excited and ready for the next match to basically survival.“We are trying to prepare for when we come out of this but we don’t really know what is going to happen – we have nine dferent budget options for next year.“We don’t know when we are going to start playing again and that is the hard, frustrating part of it all.”Asked how much the club is losing per month, Nelms replied: “This is one of these things where I won’t talk about specic numbers.“Every club is going to be dferent – most clubs don’t have the insurance policies we have in place so they will be losing more than we will.“The government has really stepped in and helped out the mid-sized to lower-end clubs.“At the bigger clubs with the salaries the players are on, although the furlough helps, it doesn’t help a huge amount.“I would say Dundee Football Club and others around the size of our club are at a pucker point where it really helps us out and it helps out clubs below us but above it won’t help out as much.“We’re OK at the moment but we don’t know what is going to happen.”Despite not knowing when the next campaign will be, fans have already been putting money into the club by buying season tickets for  .An “amazing” gesture says Nelms.“You can’t thank people enough in a day and age like this where every day you are living basically day-to-day to see people step up and buy season tickets is amazing,” he added.“It’s incredible to see the number of people who have bought them with a big unknown going forward.“We will be playing football at some point in time, we just don’t know exactly when.“The fact they have faith in the club and desperately want to see their team is helpful – and also helps us build the team based on the support we have.“We know there are things that are way more important now than football butpeople want to dig in their pockets then great,not we’ll see you when we are all back together and have a good product on the park.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.26524181-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"george cran ends means dundee john nelms reconstruction","story":"Grabbing an interview with John Nelms isn’t an easy task at the best of times.During a coronavirus shutdown where he’s been buffeted from all sides of Scottish football it seemed almost impossible.The Dundee managing director prefers to do his business out of the media glare, often to the frustration of fans and journalists alike.Even before the lockdown began, I had been pestering Dundee’s media team for a chat with the American to talk about the status of the club.Then all the voting rigmarole kicked off and it was even more important to find out his side of the story.I can’t pretend I#m always in agreement with decisions made at the top of the club over the past few years but Nelms has always been polite and pleasant to chat with.I take him at his word that he wanted to improve our game as a whole – and within that, Dundee’s future prospects # though I know for certain there will be howls coming from certain parts of the country about conspiracy and all sorts.He stated clearly any Rangers accusations hold no water because decisions on the top flight have been left to the SPFL board while Dundee United’s title hopes were not his concern.Future co-operation with Inverness, meanwhile, doesn’t look very likely after private WhatsApp messages between the clubs found their way into the public sphere – “not business-like and very poor” is Nelms putting his real feelings mildly.However much I don’t agree with how we got to it through the voting U-turn, as a football fan I am pleased reconstruction is seriously being discussed.Technically there were no rules broken. Morally, however, it is more dubious.Butthere has to be a bit of skulduggery to improve Scottish football for everyone then I can live with that."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"screen-siren-mae-west-stopped-traffic-glasgow-visit","story":"ldquoCHILDREN adore me, cooed screen siren Mae West when she met a young fan in Glasgow during the heyday of her career."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"remembering key workers in inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray#s war memorial was lit up blue this week in tribute to the work being done by NHS staff and other key workers during the coronavirus crisis.The tribute was organised by Inveraray#s branch of the Royal British Legion Scotland.

for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos

firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not

Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster

Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"boys-birthday-bagpipe-tunes-bring-smile-kids-faces","story":"Sam Johnston, , of Tweedie Place, North Berwick, has been playing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo on his bagpipes for other young residents in the Walker Homes Glen Ora development.Law Primary School P pupil Sam, who plays for Preston Lodge Pipe Band, is helping children with birthdays celebrate their special day despite lockdown.It started when one mum, Fee Andrews, posted on a neighbourhood Facebook group asking for people to hang out of their windows and sing lsquoHappy Birthdayrsquo to her son Brodie.Samrsquos mum Fiona suggested that he could play the bagpipes and, after playing for four-year-old Brodie, who described the experience as ldquogood, Sam has been inundated with requests.In keeping with social distancing guidelines, Sam plays the tune by his front door, with neighbours welcome to stand on the pavement and sing along.Fiona said: ldquoHe has been practising in the garden every day, and is doing his lessons online.ldquoHersquos doing something good for his community ndash giving his pipes a blow and doing something nice forthe kids that are stuck inside.ldquoI am really proud of him.

There are opportunities to continue doing some of the activities we are doing remotely when weto normal.She is one of several staff members who have had to change the way they give support over the past weeks but it still focuses on many of the same issues. They provide help with filling out job and college applications, and provide young people with emotional support and tutoring. The response has also generally been very positive, with staff members reporting engagement levels of up to  per cent from their clients.Natasha McInninie, transitions service co-ordinator, said: ldquoI am surprised by how resilient young people are. I thought we would lose a lot of young people through this situation. However, it has actually made them engage more.Emma Scarclfe, acting chief executive, is also very pleased by how both Bridges Project staff and the young people they work with have responded to the current crisis.She said: ldquoBridges Project has adapted quickly to the unexpected situation around Covid-. Engagement continues to be extremely high and the commitment and dedication from staff to change their working practices so quickly to suit each inidual young person has been a complete triumph.

Now the reality of the lockdown is settling in and it is starting to become challenging.This trend has also been observed by personal development worker, Chris Nicol, who said: ldquoThe young people were dealing with it well during the first few weeks but have seen a downturn in their mood over the last two weeks.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

The Scottish Government has a deplorable track record in trousering the local government funding it gets from Westminster for its own ends. Over the last  years, Scottish councils have lost seven per cent of their funding despite rising demand. As a result they have drained their reserves, and now find themselves in a nightmarish situation where revenue is noseing with people defaulting on rent and Council Tax just as demand for their services is hitting an all-time high. Unlike charities and businesses, councils cannot furlough their staff but have to bear all the costs of the lockdown themselves.All this means that the people councils serve are not only facing more hardship than ever before but far more than they need to. We see that, for example, in the thousands of businesses who have yet to receive their emergency grants, or the countless children who lack the support and equipment to be able to benefit from home schooling.Councils are the frontline when it comes to helping people through this crisis, and deserve much better treatment from this niggardly Government.Linda Holt , Anstruther.I THINK that Kate Forbes is right to seek proper detailed analyses of local government financial issues before releasing emergency funding. A fund of pound million will not go far.Already you note that Edinburgh and Highland are ldquoclaiming poundmillion between them.I realise that local authorities are doing a good job in these strange times but there are many things that are budgeted for that they are not doing too. I donrsquot think we should reimburse councils for lost income like lower parking charges or leisure centre fees .Letrsquos see the accounts.Allan McDougall, Neilston.THEATRES and concert halls were amongst the first public buildings to close to the public when the lockdown was introduced and we expect to be amongst the last to re-open. Every indication of a timetable for ato a ldquonew normalcy is that we will most likely find ourselves at the end of the phased process and it is equally likely that a large number valued cultural institutions will be have been lost along the way.It is a devastating situation for so many providers of cultural activity in Scotland. However, we have no choice but to accept this situation and we wait to be told under what conditions we may be able to open again so that we can plan to provide performances and events in restricted conditions. Many theatres like the Tron have performances ready to stage this autumn while at the same time we are well aware that the delay to re-opening may be a lot longer.I assume this principle will apply to all such places of public gathering. However, I read today that the Catholic Church in Scotland is drawing up a strategy to re-open buildings and for masses toin the near future . I wish the church good luck in its discussions with the Scottish Government on this issue but I am confused by the rationale. We are all buildings where the public assembles to communally participate in events. If a special dispensation is given then we should be allowed to stage theatre shows in churches after mass has ended ... at least until our own buildings can open again.Andy Arnold, Artistic Director, Tron Theatre, Glasgow.I AM a   live-in carer dedicated to caring for elderly and disabled people.I am employed by an agency currently advertising on national television for staffThis week I phoned the office three times to ask for PPE to be delivered to the address where I am looking after a client with underlying health issues.

forced to pay out a substantial legal bill after losing a court battle over controversial plans to extend a retail park.Council officials had granted planning permission for a cinema, hotel and food and retail outlets to be added to Westway Retail Park in Cumbernauld, but the owners of a shopping mall in the town centre challenged the move at the Court of Session.The court ruled against the councilrsquos decision and found that its reasons for granting permission were ldquoperverse and inadequate and ldquomaterially flawed.In a written judgment on the case, Lord Burns stated: ldquoI find that the respondentsfailed to fulfil their statutory duties under the  Act that they erred in law that they failed to give proper reasons and that they acted unreasonably.He ordered that the council should now ldquore-examine the application.The retail park, around . miles from the town centre, currently has a number of home and DIY stores on site.However Dutch firm Promontoria Holdings applied for planning permission to extend it and develop a number of other leisure and shopping outlets.The councilrsquos planning committee approved the plans in June last year but the owners of the townrsquos Antonine Shopping Centre, Bridges Antonine LLP, sought a judicial review of the decision.They claimed that, as the council had failed to carry out a Retail Impact Assessment, officials ldquoacted unreasonably and perversely in concluding that the Westway proposal could be developed without detriment to Cumbernauld Town Centre.Lord Burns agreed and found that the local authority failed to properly assess the impact the proposal would have on Cumbernauld town centre, adding that the centre had problems with ldquoretail contraction and vacancy issues.He also found that councillors were not provided with sufficient information to make their decision.The council could now be forced to pay Bridges Antoninersquos legal costs in the case, as well as paying for their own legal fees at the expense of the taxpayer.This is likely to run to tens of thousands of pounds.Tom Tyler, Investment Director at Bridges Antonine, claimed planners failed to listen to their concerns and left them no option but to pursue legal action.He said: ldquoWe are delighted the Court of Session has agreed with what we told the council from day one, namely that councillors had not been provided with the correct information.ldquoThis led them to make a decision which would have had a catastrophic impact on Cumbernauld Town Centre.ldquoWe consistently sought to find a solution to this issue but planners failed to listen to our concerns and forced us to take legal action.ldquoThis will result in signicant costs which will be picked up by council tax payers of North

[They] had been booted out... and the Germans had heavy protection in place for all the harbours on the coast.ldquoBritish Vice-Admiral John HughesHallett said that lsquothe only way we were going to get back in was to take our harbour with usrsquo.He was being flippant but lots of military commanders thought, lsquothatrsquos actually a good idearsquo.ldquoThere was lots of activity at Rigg Bay but the first inkling that the estate factor had about the presence of the military was signs going up on the estate fences saying military property ndash please keep out. There was no consultation.Garlieston is just one of several locations north of the Border that played a crucial role in preparing troops for D-Day. From the Tarbat peninsula to Highland lochs, the countryrsquos contribution was huge.But, for Mr Walter, the technical ingenuity involved makes the work that took place in his village particularly notable.ldquoThe area was chosen for the evaluation of three prototypes owing to its remoteness and beach conditions similar to northern France, he said.ldquoOf the three prototypes, two were quickly eliminated. The pier head for the one that was sent to war was based on quite an old design by Lobnitz and Co, which was based in Renfrew.ldquoThe key innovation was the floating roadway designed by Allan Beckett, who was a military engineer. He designed it pretty much from scratch and that is what made the whole thing work.ldquoThe contribution that the geography provided was absolutely huge because it meant that prototype evaluation was able to take place beyond the reach of German reconnaissance and pretty much out of sight.The components were later assembled and towed out to France under the noses of the enemy.ldquoPerhaps the most striking thing about the project was the timescale, said Mr Walter. ldquoWhen you think about civil engineering projects now the timescales just go on and on, as do the budgets, whereas here we are talking about a project that went from a cold start in  to trials in  and full implementation on D-Day in June .As well as hosting experimental engineering work, Scotland became a vast training camp.On the beaches of the Moray Firth and along the Tarbat Peninsula, army, navy and artillery units were put through their paces, honing the ability to launch coastal assaults and deliver live gunfire support.Elsewhere, castle estates such as Inveraray and Achnacarry hosted thousands of soldiers who learned how to deploy small landing craft which were vital to the June  landings.ldquoThe beauty of Scotland is that it was unlikely to be raided by the Luftwaffe, said historian Simon Forty, whose book, D-Day UK:  Locations in Britain, charts sites where the attack was planned and prepared for.ldquoIt was out of the way. It provided the armed forces with protected water and inlets that they could use.ldquoTherersquos a strong case for saying that the training that took place in Scotland was the most important for the actual D-Day landing itself because it was in Scotland that troop training with landing craft took place.For Bob Towns, President of Nairn Legion, the sheer scale of activity underlines the importance of memorials such as the one erected on the townrsquos links to honour the rd British Infantry Division.ldquoWalking along the seafront of Nairn on a bonny day, without something like the memorial being there, you would never know what went on, he said.ldquoThatrsquos where the team was built up... so that, when it came to the actual day, they knew one another, they knew how the others operated, and that helped them get the men ashore. Without [that] training, I am sure the casualties would have been far higher.

They have discussed the full suite of topics typically included in FTAs, allowing, the department said, for talks to get underway quickly.The UKrsquos negotiating objectives make clear any future agreement must protect the NHS and continue to uphold the countryrsquos high standards on food safety and animal welfare.The Government added that it was committed to a transparent approach to the trade negotiations and would publish a summary of the first round once it had concluded.Commenting on the start of the talks, Adam Marshall, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ldquoWhile most UK businesses will be focusing on the immediate challenge posed by coronavirus, strong trading arrangements with both the European Union and USA will support recovery and future growth.ldquoThe Government has set a high ambition for UK-US talks and it will be particularly important to get the details right over the coming months to ensure that any prospective agreement delivers tangible benefits to businesses and communities across the UK.He went on: ldquoCompanies will welcome the focus on helping more UK SMEs grow their trade with partners in the US and on finding ways to move goods, people and data across borders between the two countries more smoothly.Mr Marshall added: ldquoWe will be working constructively with the Government to ensure the needs of UK business communities are considered in negotiations with the USA and with other key trading partners."},{"url":null,"title":"original-airwaves-joke-every-occasion","story":"Comedian and radio presenterBorn: November , .Died: April , .RADIO presenter, comedian and panto star Lou Grant has died after suffering with dementia for several years. The -year-old, however, managed to retain the impish sense of humour and mild devilment which served him so well in his career.It was a career that saw Grant storm national television, perform with iety and comedy greats such as Dave Allen , Bob Monkhouse, The Krankies and Sydney Devine.Yet, while West Sound Radio and theatre audiences loved Lou Grant, his love of a little anarchy could cause radio programme controllers to scratch their heads in dismay, theatre directorsrsquo mouths to fall open wide, and, on one occasion, a helicopter pilotrsquos head to shake in disbelief.There was little doubt that Lou Grant Ritchiewas born to make people laugh. Although he grew up close to the race track ndash his father was an Ayr bookmaker ndash schoolteachers would not have bet against young Lou choosing a showbiz career.Seduced early on by the lights of the townrsquos Gaiety Theatre, aged  the teenager landed work as a page boy showing audiences to their seats. At , he was working on comedianrsquos follow spots, lighting up the stage while magic was being performed ndash and dreaming of such a le for himself.Her Majesty contained that dream for two years when he was sent on his National Service stint to Malaysia with the Royal Scots Fusiliers. Demobbed in Yorkshire, Lou Grant landed work in the Butlins holiday camps, in Skegness and Filey, as a Red Coat. Not only did he meet great friends such as Monkhouse and Allen, he met his future we Margaret, also a budding entertainer.The couple based themselves in Maggiersquos home town of Birmingham while Grant worked the working menrsquos clubs all over the north of England and south Wales. ldquoHe told me of how tough this le was many years later, said chum and one-time panto partner Sydney Devine. ldquoI knewhe had survived these clubs he had to be very good. And he was.Grant was talented enough to win TVrsquos Opportunity Knocks. He recalled many years later: ldquoOpportunity Knocks was the earliest version of Britainrsquos Got Talent and after winning the show I toured with Hughie Green, his assistant Monica Rose and acts like muscle man Tony Holland.The profile of the show helped Lou Grant to work continually throughout the Sixties and Seventies. Audiences loved his cheeky delivery and he became a warm-up man alongside old pal Monkhouse on TV show The Golden Shot.Lou Grant also travelled abroad with the White Heather Club tartan iety shows, headlined by stars such as Andy Stewart. At one gig in Canada, Grant actually became Andy Stewart, reveals old friend and West Sound colleague, Jim Higgins. ldquoAndy Stewart was taken ill and the promoter suggested to Lou that since he looked a little like Andy, and the audience didnrsquot really know what Andy looked like outside of a photo, that he take his place. Lou laughed and said he only knew four Scottish songs. But he was up for the challenge and he sang those four songs on a loop. To this day those audiences donrsquot know they were being entertained by Lou.Grantrsquos stint in England had come to an end in  when he moved back to Scotland in the hope of landing work with Ayrrsquos new radio station. Managing Director Kenneth Roy realised he had a major talent on his hands.Former Programme Controller Gordon McArthur smiles as he recalls how Lou Grantcould also present a regular challenge. ldquoLou would sometimes ignore music policy. Hersquod suddenly announce lsquoIrsquom not playing that!rsquo and put on a Scottish traditional record he liked. But it was harmless fun. And the listeners loved this.One morning Grant played an early Elvis rocker, faded the record and then announced in a straight voice: ldquoI donrsquot know who told him he could sing.Sydney Devine recalls the ldquogreat, fun times working in panto with Grant in the mid-Eighties. ldquoLou was a master comedian and he was so fast and slick. And he was also wicked. Wersquod have young actors in the show who were straight out of drama school, who wouldnrsquot put a comma out of place and needed to stick to the script religiously that was all they knew. But each night, Lou would ad-lib, not quite giving them their feed line on time. The audiences would love it. It showed how he could play with a script, get laughs, and get it right back on the page. He was a master. And the producers never knew what Lou was going to do next.Writer and comedy actor Russell Laine agrees that trying to tie Grant to a tight script was like trying to catch the wind in a jeely jar. ldquoWe had a magic act, Fernando Natasha, he recalls. ldquoI was Natasha, and he was the very funny drunken magician. And his ad-libs were brilliant.Lou Grant was always his own man. Gordon McArthur recalls a stint in Belize, where charity supporter Granthad gone to back the Forces at Christmas time. ldquoWe went out there to record messages from the troops for broadcast at home, and the trip involved us taking a helicopter high above a mountain on the Belize Guatemala border to get to a tiny campsite. ldquoMy greatest memory of that trip is seeing Lou leap down several feet from the helicopter onto the peak of the mountain ndash wearing a Santa hat.The entertainer seemed to work to his own clock. ldquoLou would MC many charity events over the years but the little problem with Lou was he couldnrsquot stick to just the allocated ten minutes. He had a story for every occasion. But that was his great strength.Former West Sound colleague Jim Higgins agrees Lou Grant loved to walk the fine line between professional conformity and mild anarchy. ldquoI can remember him telling me he had a walk-on part in Crossroads [the s TV soap based in Birmingham.] Lou wouldnrsquot just walk on. He was determined to say something, evenit was just lsquoGood morning,rsquo because it was a challenge to him, and those words meant he was paid extra.And he got extra attention. ldquoOh yes, says his friend. ldquoBut that was Lou. He loved it. And even off-stage he lit up a room. You couldnrsquot get angry with him.The comedianrsquos health worsened on the death of his we in .Sydney Devine maintains his friend is a very hard act to follow. ldquoLou was a wonderful wee man, and so well-loved.

After all, isolate, like insulate, comes from a root that means island.On one level, Donne was certainly right. A paradoxical effect of lockdown has been to emphasise how dependent we all are on other people for the most basic things. Even the folk who were congratulating themselves on their sourdough starters a few weeks ago have discovered that you may be able to make bread without buying yeast, but it gets much trickier when therersquos no flour in the shops.Naturally, thatrsquos a trivial example compared with the real suffering of those who have lost loved ones, or who have seen their livelihoods destroyed. But while wersquore all affected to some degree by the current restrictions, their effects are very far from being equal.Some people ndash especially those whose who can work comfortably from home, or whose income is secure ndash are clearly finding the lockdown irksome rather than traumatic. There are lots of other factors involved those who are in a household with others may be finding it easier than those separated from loved ones . Hence the predictions of a spike in both the orce rate and the birth rate as a result of the pandemic.How big your house is, whether it has a garden, the reliability of your broadband, or your proximity to the countryside, or to a shop carrying essentials, all have an impact on the ability to cope with the current curtailments on our freedom. The most signicant consideration, however, is a matter of attitude.The ndash to me, rather surprising ndash results of a poll conducted at the weekend indicate that only one in five of us thinks that it would be a good idea for schools to go back, while not more than about one in ten thinks that the time is right for pubs and restaurants to reopen. No doubt much of this caution is based on the fact that the authorities, political and scientic, stress the importance of maintaining restrictions until we are certain that we are well into the downward slope of the diseasersquos transmission. Itrsquos probably, for the moment at least, the sensible view.But in the UK, complaints seem to be limited to crackpots from the anti-vaccine movement or conspiracy theorists convinced that G masts are part of a Tory plot to murder the population. Indeed, most of those who are complaining loudest about the policies designed to deal with the pandemic are cross about the measures that have not been brought in ndash demanding that the airports should be closed, or that it should be compulsory to wear masks and gloves.Itrsquos rather alarming to see the eagerness with which some have embraced the opportunity to boss everyone  about, shop their neighbours, or argue that coronavirus proves the case for something ndash communism, nationalisation of utilities, universal basic income, the sugar tax, halting immigration, a smoking ban ndash that they already believed in.On the whole, however, the attitudes towards lockdown from those who are not seriously affected by personal or financial loss seem to be less a matter of political disposition than of temperament. What matters is how social you are, rather than how socialist.The clearest examples are in those activities which depend for their appeal on the fact that they are communal: not so much having a meal in a restaurant or chatting to friends in the pub, which most of us will be missing to some degree, but gatherings which rely on mass shared responses for their emotional pull. Those of us ndash and I admit Irsquom one ndash who arenrsquot particularly susceptible to this sort of thing, or whose idea of hell is crowded gatherings, will no doubt shrug, but it shouldnrsquot blind us to the real loss which many people will be finding it.For some it will be church or mosque, for others nightclubs or music festivals. But some of the effect even of those activities can be satisfied in isolation. You may not be able to go to the cinema, but you can still watch a film live music may be preferable to recordings, but therersquos no overall shortage of music and people are not entirely deprived of the consolations of religion just because services are suspended.The great exception to this, and the one that seems to be a trial for a lot of people, seems to be sport. I was annoyed by the interruption to the Six Nations, but I wouldnrsquot say that the near-disappearance of competitive sport has made much dference to me. But for those who follow a football team, or racing, who count the days until Wimbledon rolls round, or were keenly anticipating the Olympics, this must be a considerable deprivation ndash and at exactly a time when that sort of distraction, as well as a sense of tribal belonging, would have been most welcome.Sport may be a trling matter when compared with the NHS or the economy but the loss of it should seem ndash even to those of us not much bothered by it ndash one of the strangest aspects of the current lockdown. And, unfortunately for the fans, it also appears to be one of the things that will be hardest to get back to normal.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

There are strong, practical reasons why this should happen.ldquoIt is important, as Scotlands two governments make such onerous, dficult demands on people to stay at home and to stay away from family and friends, that we speak with the same voice.ldquoIf we can present a simple, clear, united message, it will be much more effective. The more we feel we are in this together, the more we will pull together to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Mr Jack also insists a UK-wide approach will also be best for Scottish businesses and will help the economy recover as strongly as possible and will help save as many jobs as possible.ldquoWe are, after all, he stresses, ldquopart of the UK economy.The Secretary of State points out % of Scotlands trade is with the rest of the UK and as restrictions are eased, businesses will need a ldquolevel playing field to compete.ldquoSo, Im in no doubt that moving forwards as one United Kingdom will save lives and save livelihoods.Mr Jack says the two governments agree on this broad principle and acknowledges Ms Sturgeon has pointed to the advantages of taking a UK-wide approach to tackling the coronavirus.ldquoDevolution, rightly, gives the Scottish Government a key role in responding to the coronavirus outbreak. But the ability to do things dferently, which is central to devolution, does not, and never has, meant that things are best done dferently.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is a national emergency and has created an unprecedented challenge for the whole of the UK. We should meet the challenge together, he insists.The Secretary of State says most dferences between the two governments have been minor but he picks up on two that have caused him concern.On creating a discrete Scottish business support scheme, he says: ldquoEven now - after a U-turn forced by an outcry among businessmen and pressure led by Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw - levels of support for the retail, hospitality and leisure sector fall well short compared to England.On constructions sites, he notes: ldquoThe Scottish Government has also failed to justy its decision to shut down all building sites apart from hospitals. South of the border, the advice is to continue to go to work but only where it can be done safely and where you are unable to work from home.ldquoHere, the Scottish Government has decreed no building site can be operated safely.

It is better known as a way of cocooning infants through the immunisation of close family members against disease.The team from Edinburgh University, Imperial College London, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have modelled a range of scenarios to illustrate how dferent restrictions could be applied to dferent groups.They show \"the effects on the epidemic curve of a gradual ramping up of protection for the vulnerable population and a gradual ramping down of restrictions on the non-vulnerable population over a period of  weeks after lockdown\"Their findings have been made available to the UK and Scottish Governments.The strategy involves segmenting the population into dferent risk groups, based on a personrsquos medical history and potential healthcare needs.: Scotlands death rate from Covid likely to be lower than rest of UK due to lockdown timingAs a result, younger healthy adults and children would resume something closer to normal le while those most at risk would continue to be shielded at home, with the added safeguard of targeted virus screening.They write: \"Intensive screening would, ideally, include daily checks for symptoms, daily tests for virus presence , regular serological [antibody] testing and monitoring of frequent contactsof shielders.\"If too large fraction of the population were to be classied as lsquoshieldersrsquo this would quickly overwhelm current testing capacity in the UK.\"Nonetheless, routine rapid testing of shielders could have a signicant impact and further increase the scope for relaxing restrictions on the entire population.\"Researchers say lockdown restrictions could be eased for most people, as long as sufficient public health measures stay in place to keep transmission rates low.These would include self-isolation of people with Covid-, quarantining affected households, contact tracing and voluntary social distancing.The most vulnerable ndash the frail elderly and those with underlying medical conditions such as cancer, heart or respiratory diseasesndash would still need to be shielded from contact with anyone potentially infected with the virus.To achieve this, people sharing a house with a vulnerable person, care workers and health professionals would need to protect themselves from infection.However, the risk to the rest of the population could be managed without resorting to lockdown.The study stresses that the general non-shielding population will continue to be the \"main reservoir of infection\", therefore surveillance measures to contain the spread of the virus will be essential, say the researchers.They write: \"It is therefore vital that transmission rates are kept as low as possible, eventhis population is allowed to exit lockdown.\"Measures including self-isolation of cases, quarantining of affected households, contact tracing and voluntary physical distancing will be necessary to achieve this.\"In all our scenarios the vulnerable segment is subject to increased protection indefinitely. [Segmenting and shielding] is also more likely to succeedthere is less or no relaxation of restrictions on shielders.\"They say that contact tracing can include \"both traditional and app-based\" methods.However, the researchers caution that not enough is known about the build-up of immunity in affected populations and stress that this aspect of the epidemic needs to be monitored very closely.Dr Bram van Bunnik, Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Edinburghrsquos Usher Institute, said: ldquoEasing the measures taken during the lockdown is important as they currently have a tremendous effect on our society, but this should only be done in a way that is both safe for the people that are most vulnerable as well as for the health and safety of NHS staff.\"Segmentation and shielding is a possible way of achieving this: measures could be eased for a large proportion of the population, however the vulnerable population likely still needs to be protected for a prolonged period."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-schools-not-set-fully-re-open-foreseeable-future","story":"A new document has been published by the Scottish Government ndash setting out its framework for decision-making in lting the lockdown restrictions.The document stresses that ldquoit will not be possible to lt all the current restrictions at once, or soon and warns that ldquosome will remain part of daily le for theforeseeablefuture - until a reliable vaccine or treatment is available.Officials estimate that around , people in Scotland are currently infected with Covid- and the R-naught infection rate is ldquolikely to lie between .and..:Coronavirus in Scotland: Scottish Government advisor backs lockdown exit that lts restrictions for majority but shields most vulnerableThey add: ldquoThere is some evidence that the currentR number in Scotland is slightly above that where in the UK.The document sets out choices and options the Scottish Government is exploring in lting the restrictions, when it is safe to do so.All options ldquoremain under consideration at this stage and ldquono specic changes have been decided upon.The Scottish Government is ldquoconsideringand how we could make changes to allow people to leave their home more often and or for longer.It adds that this would mean people stay in their local area and within their own household group.Government officials are also looking at ldquochanges to allow people to meet with a small number of others outside their own household in a group or bubble that acts as a single, self-contained unit, without connections to other households or bubbles.It is possible that this option would be introduced first for outdoor meetings and the number allowed in groups is still being considered.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Covid victims could be quarantined away from householdAmid calls for health services to resume, including cancer screenings, the Scottish Government is ldquoconsidering whether and how we can resume these services, provided this can be done safely and without unacceptable risk.The document adds: ldquoThe options under consideration include resuming certain NHS Scotland elective procedures and screening services, and the phased re-introduction of a wider range of social care support such as therapeutic group activities.The Scottish Government is ldquoconsidering a phased approach to ing pupils to school, when it is safe to do soBut the document warns: ldquoWe do not consider it likely that schools will reopen fully in the foreseeable future.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally.

Mr Russell’s comments come in the wake of the First Minister’s announcement of an expansion of testing.Following the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “There is an increasing level of public interest in the proposals put forward by Professor Pennington and Dr Allyson Pollock in recent weeks that the islands could start to ease lockdown restrictions sooner than mainland Scotland.“Such a strategy could only be adopted, however,a rigorous and extensive system of testing, tracing and isolating was firmly established. The First Minister’s announcement today of a further expansion of testing perhaps paves the way for such a system being put in place.“Public safety, of course, remains the priority and must underpin any decision taken in relation to how and when restrictions are eventually lted. That is true of our island communities as it is other parts of the country.“However, ministers must not discount possible options without proper consideration. I therefore welcome Mr Russell’s assurances that the government will engage actively and constructively in the debate about whether and how our islands might safely take the lead.“This is unlikely to lead to any quick decisions, not least as the stakes are so high.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected.

Andthe car breaks down, they will need a mechanic.They need water and electricity and the internet, and might also need a treat delivered from a mail order company during their well-deserved down time.Then there are the people who support the people who support the people who support…and so on.And so there emerges a whole network of service providers, businesses large and small # a web of commerce and production.In order to provide for the frontline, a whole system of interrelated businesses exists, many which might not appear to be essential, but may provide a key element, a small cog in the big picture.In the short term key workers can perhaps get by, but society shouldn’t allow its critical people to just muddle through, as the lockdown period extends, then the need for this support becomes more evident and relevant, and so the web of essentiality widens.As more roles, jobs and links in society are realised and considered necessary, and indispensability spreads, recreation and tourism won’t get much of a look in.We could argue that people need to visit the Old Man of Storr for our economic well-being as much as for their own health and well-being, but for the time being the beds and hot spots will remain empty.So, in order to be relevant and useful, we should perhaps look to our other skills.If tourism is our only income then we have to be creative, not only to make provision but to keep spirit and self-actualisation alive.Economically,tourism is a second income, the icing on the salaried or pensioned cake, then perhaps we just take the hit, and revert back to a less affluent lestyle.Many tourist providers left skills and talents in a previous le, perhaps now is the time to revisit and reimagine those skills.As I understand it, Skye is still waiting.Perhaps by the time this column is online, the virus will be more evident, during this waiting game now more than ever we need to be physically distant, and careful with how we operate.But it is crucial that we also need to look after our mental health and well-being, and so delivering the prescriptions is really as important to volunteer as it is for the receiver.Humans are a social animal, and we need to be part of a community, because we are all essential.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/norrie-grandfather.jpg","title":"norrie t macdonald the cycle of the sea and island traditions of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAlthough Shinigeadh was our training pool as youngstersand probably today seems quite safe and relatively innocuous it was also my first introduction to the concept of ‘industrial’ fishing.was strictly for deployment only by the stronger adults.It consisted of a stf polefrom which was slung a netted hoop, around - feet in diameter.It was to our mini-bamboo rods, what the Broch purse-seiner was to the Scalpay ring-netter.There had obviously been a couple of nights where our amateur, one-at-a-time, efforts to procure a decent supper had been insufficient to adequately harvest the bounty on offer.I remember the bodach and both the uncles appearing with the borrowed ‘poc’, intrigued as to what purpose it could possibly serve.’.A couple of pocketfuls of just-about-right, newly boiled, potatoes were the secret weapon.The cuddies scattered as the ‘poc’ got lowered into the sea.Crushing a potato into small pieces and scattering on the surface elicited a frenzy of activity.The timing of the hauling of the ‘poc’ was crucial.A miss, and you could maybe only land a couple.A full hit and you might struggle to lt it out of the water at all, requiring a re-submersion.This could result in losing the lot, the elusive cuddy being much quicker than the second haul.It took the knotting of the legs and sleeves of one of the standard, adult, blue boiler suits to make a receptacle big enough to take that night’s catch home.It was the first time I observed the tradition of the ‘share’.Walking back through the village, it was like we were expected.Several caileachs came to their gate with a basin, each the recipient of half a dozen dozen fish, dependent on their familysize.It was a tradition Iain ‘Scud’ MacLeod, George ‘Baba’ Richards and myself continued as we graduated onto the big bamboo in Bayble School.They were my fishing buddies as we moved onto the next level in our adventures.The full bamboo rod required technique and balance.Especially when we moved further afield onto the more dficult fishing hot-spots. every night.We were careful not to take the prime spots lest we got a mouthful, but we were tutored and encouraged, warned about any pitfalls and certainly well chaperoned for our own education and safety.We moved further up towards the Tiumpan where the rocks were more daunting, each climb steeper and requiring a working knowledge of the way down.With a -foot pole and in wellies.’ were the favourites, not too tricky a climb and with deep water just off the inside-point. were reserved for night when we felt particularly brave or even simply when they hadn’t been claimed by the adults.They were prime locations, great fishing spots, but generally could only accommodate a single rod.’ were up at the Tiumpan itself and required the right combination of tides and prevailing wind to be accessible, safe and productive. .The big rod came with several dferent options.The flywhich mimicked sand eels, consisted of usually three, four or six hooks, depending on what you were after .It could be deployed with, or without, a weight on the end.’was an issue.In the deeper water, a ‘dandy’ was best. This involved far less effort, a simple up and down motion of the tip of the rod producing plentul yields.’, basin outstretched, every night we caught more than was our fill.We also, as we got more adventurous, took to a bigger, single, hook and a longer, single trace .Barring this, a rubber eel.We were moving up from cuddy to lythe.What a fright the first one gave me!Two pulls of almighty force, then ‘I give up’.Deadweight.The sense of yet another ‘graduation’ was palpable, but the lythe was no grand fighting fish.It marked another progression up whatever the fishing ‘ladder’ was.By this time we were regulars in the town and had had our introduction to Meg’s ‘Electro Sports’ shop.He had, to our limited experience anyway, a huge assortment of rods and tackle for us to gawp at.Naturally, we moved up to spinning rods, monofilament, lures, kosters and paternosters., in competitions to see who could be the first to ,  or even .Traumatised for an hour or so, they would get ed to the water as the sun began to set.With spinning rods we learned a completely dferent set of rules.What was deep  yards out and what was disaster for your tackle.How to tie a proper knot and which kit worked best for the conditions.How to unravel a reel-tangle with three mackerel on the line .The cost of losing gear was beginning to hit the pocket-money hard.The only real solution was to get better at making your own.You learned how to make your own trace # downy seagull feathers were better, but not as practical as sheep’s wool # and how to tie knots that never ‘slipped’.Graduating onto more ‘specialist’ fish and fishing became a challenge after years of cuddies, mackerel and lythe.Fancier bait lugworm, real sand eel, salted herring even, were meant to be great to entice the bottom feeders flounder, sole, gurnard, possibly haddock and lingyou could reach with a long cast.Ok, so we mostly caught dogfish and, like every single other thing we pulled up, handling one came with its own set of rules.Mackerel have a nasty wee ‘sting’ in front of their anal fin, a small protrusion of cartilage bone which can catch the unwary out.Gurnard require welding gloves and a lesser-spotted dogfish will try to wrap its tail around your arm and give you a nasty ‘Chinese burn’.Rub your fingers against the ‘grain’ of one’s scales next time you see one.It’s like rough sandpaper.Everyone’s ambition, however, was to get out on one of the village boats.We had grown up with Roddy Alec and ‘Saight’, the last proper village fishermen who plied their trade on the ‘Fisher Lass’ out of Portnaguran.The ‘Fisher Lass’ was a substantial wooden boat, somewhere between the privately owned ‘rowing’ boats # each one now had a Seagull, Mariner or Evinrude rather than rely on such menial propulsion # and the commercial trawlers.Hers was a serious purpose we just wanted some fun.Whilst the rocks could disappoint, we were brought up with the notion that being a quarter mile offshore must come with an assurance of plenty.There were boats on the Portvoller side as well.The trick was, in the absence of having a boat in the family, knowing someone who did and whose father uncle was prepared to take responsibility for you for a couple of hours.Three a side, with mackerel or herring running, was huge entertainment.It was, necessitated by space and safety, ato hand lines again and a degree of ‘back to basics’ which felt very raw..A fish meal factory, dependent mostly on locally caught sand eels, but which handled mackerel and pout when available it could stink out the entire town given the right conditions.My father would come home, not entirely fragrant, and I would rush to get the folded-up daily paper from his lunch box.There were days, especially in the height of summer, when I couldn’t get beyond the back page .Little did I realise, until many years later, the destruction caused by overfishing of the type to assault the senses so violently..Barryhad procurement of his uncle’s boat and we made an anchor out of an old engine, attached a buoy and plastic ring, then ran yds of mm, in a loop, to the shore.The rest, you might say, is piracy.All good fun until the fishery cruiser, possibly the ‘Minna’, I couldn’t comment, came along one morning and confiscated the net, cod ‘n’ all.Now this could have been a delicious irony.I referred last week to the passing down of genes through the generations.The son and ‘heir to fresh air’ was never a guy to show his hand early, certainly not while in school.We had no clue what career path he would decide on, his head, whilst not always in proximity, wascertainly edging closer to the clouds.“I’m going to sea Da, to do marine engineering”, he one day boldly announced.Luckily, no one had a feather handy.And that’s what he did.He qualied as a ship’s engineer.It shouldn’t have been too hard to figure out where this notion came from, however., MacIver was the Chief Engineeron the old Fishery Protection Vessel, “Minna”.It is indeed a tangled web.Years later I ended up, standing on several fish boxes in the mart in Stornoway, as a fish-salesman.In my apprenticeship, under George Prince Jnr, we oversaw the landing of tens of thousands of tonnes of sand eels to HBP.The fishery was devastated, almost entirely, by local vessels and a couplefrom Barra.But while the smell was awful, the money was fantastic for all those involved.As the years progressed, the main catch moved from fish to prawns.I could tell the dference between a dab, a plaice, a brill, a turbot, a halibut, a megrim and a witch, but saw increasinglyless and less of them each year.My good pal Stuart Keyte – the local fishery officer # and I bought a small, Orkney origin, ‘clinker’-built -footer to work some creels and have a bit of ploy.You can get used to two lobsters for breakfast.But only for a wee while.Despite HBP closing down and the fishery banned, the knock-on effects of overfishing, several stocks over several decades, were beginning to take their toll.I could go to the rocks for nights on end and catch nothing.As it was, I ended up on the rocks anyway.A spell clam fishing with John Murdo ‘Easdaidh’ MacLeod was my swan song.I loved it.We left the harbour every day at am and headed for, guess where Correct, the Tiumpan.As day broke we would haul the six dredges and he would get the frying pan on whilst I sorted the catch.I could see the lights in my house going on from half a mile at sea .We had two rolls each and a cup of coffee.A huge scallop, bacon, black-pudding and fried egg on each .“If they fit through the handle of the basket, throw them over” was the rule of thumb.I’m guessing we could have been inside ‘the limit’.I’ve never fished a Loch nor a river.Not remotely interested.Given my track record, I’d have probably used a bit of dynamite, certainly a bit of mono.Just for dramatic effect.Mother Nature, left to her own devices, is a truly wonderful thing.Stocks will, eventually, recover and, managed properly could give sustainable employment for years to come.Maybe even endless fun for kids who have got too accustomed and fed up, paralysed even, from the catatonic effects of lockdown.Remember what Dougie said to Para Handy ‘The herring in Loch Fyne comes in cycles’‘Ach man’, replied Macfarlane, ‘There wass herring in the Loch long afore the cycle was inventit’.Everything goes around folks.Remember it when you contemplate your next move.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/EARIE-QUIRAING-5.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh an gobha ruadh agus domhnall an oir","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine..

The house was always full of his music.Even in sadness, Jackie, who has been a stay-at-home mum since the birth of her first child, said her parents# pride in their grandchildren will endure.They lived long lives and they took great pride in their six grandchildren, she said.Mum was always talking about how pleased she was that they all got to university.She was one of nine children and most of them went to work in factories as soon as they left school.They#ve done more with their lives but that#s initially where they started out.Jackie added: She was so proud that all six of her grandchildren got to university.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

All Mike asks for inis a small donation to the NHS as healthcare staff fight Covid-.How to NOT go to school has since been translated by teachers in Italy, France, Germany and Holland, while another version has also been translated by British Sign Language.Teachers from as far as Mexico and New Zealand also got in touch with Mike, who said he never expected the response to be as great.It#s just incredible to see this little book go so far, said Mike, who left Northern Ireland to study at St Andrew#s University in Scotland in . It#s really nice because my class can see their class mascot - PomPom the ninja - become famous which is wonderful.We#re raising a bit of money for the NHS as well which is a good outcome. It#s just brilliant.An Italian school teacher wanted to give it to their kids so she#s translated it. Lots of people seem to want to contribute and help which is amazing.I sent it to my old French teaching assistant, who now teaches as an English teacher in France, and she was saying that it has gotten really big there. There#s lots of English teachers in France sharing it with their pupils to help learn English which is really fun.Each chapter explores a dferent issue children may be experiencing during lockdown, interwoven with Parsley#s adventures with her brother Po, their nanny goats and an eclectic group of imaginary friends.After Mike first wrote the story he contacted artist Sarah Beswick and professional illustrator Rebecca Sampson, who created the drawings for the book.Reflecting on his first thoughts for the story, Mike, who is married to Rebekah, explained that he wanted to help the parents of his pupils use it as a tool to discuss mental health and wellbeing.I knew the lockdown was going to be an enormous upheaval and I wanted to give them a way where they could openly talk about mental health and deal with those issues, he stated.The style is a bit like all of the books that we have been reading in class, such as the Philip Reeve and David Walliams books.I enjoy writing. I do it for fun and sometimes I share it with the children in class, but I have never had anything published or anything like that so it#s incredible.It was just shared online and Facebook has done the rest.Fans have already asked for a sequel, perhaps looking at how children can go back to school once the lockdown is over, but Mike hopes he can get How to NOT go to school published first.When askedwriting children#s books is something he could see himself doing full-time, Mike added: I love teaching and I want to keep teaching, but it would be amazing to write as well and be published.The ideal would be able to do both of them but we#ll seethat#s possible.To download How to NOT go to school, visit parsleymimblewood.wordpressBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappActors Paddy Jenkins and Damon Quinn join family and friends to raise a toast outside Roselawn Cemetery in Belfast as the hearse arrives during the funeral of actor BJ Hogg. By Ivan LittleMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe cast of the hit TV comedy Give My Head Peace yesterday raised a socially-distanced glass and gave a fond farewell round of applause to the actor BJ Hogg, who created one of the show#s most popular characters and who died last week.Observing coronavirus restrictions at his funeral, BJ#s friends and colleagues stayed well apart as they sipped their own small measures of Black Bush whiskey, the actor#s favourite tipple.The Hole in the Wall gang had been joined at a Lisburn funeral home by some other well-known actors and technicians who had worked with BJ throughout his illustrious career on stage and on screen.The star of The Fall TV series and the Oscar-nominated short movie Dance Lexie Dance died suddenly last week on his th birthday.His costume designer we Elish and their children Nathan and Abigail watched as his coffin was brought from the funeral parlour to a waiting hearse.Nathan had posted a video online of his father singing a powerful song from the Ulster Scots musical On Eagle#s Wing, and he added a message saying: Love you Dad. What a Voice.There were lighter moments on social media too. Some fans of BJ#s alter ego from Give My Head Peace , Big Mervyn, the dim-witted loyalist, wonderedhe would get a paramilitary-style funeral anda service would be conducted by the show#s fundamentalist Protestant cleric, Pastor Begbie.In the end there was no funeral service but Paddy Jenkins, the actor who plays Pastor Begbie, was among the mourners at the funeral home, along with other GMHP performers including Tim McGarry, Michael McDowell, Damon Quinn, Dan Gordon, Alexandra Ford and Marty Reid, who plays Big Mervyn#s sidekick, Uncle Andy.BBC floor manager Stephen Killen was also there, as were Game of Thrones star Ian McElhinney and his playwright we Marie Jones and actors Alan McKee and Marty Maguire.En route to Roselawn Crematorium, the hearse stopped briefly outside BJ#s old boyhood home in Westbourne Terrace, Lisburn.Some of the GMPH team went on to stand at the gates of Roselawn as BJ#s hearse arrived for cremation.No one is currently allowed inside the church there due to the Covid- crisis.Paddy Jenkins, who also worked with BJ on On Eagle#s Wing, reflected on a dficult day.He said: It was heartbreaking to realise that BJ#s loved ones didn#t get the chance to say a proper farewell. But the times we are living in mean nothing is the way it is supposed to be.There mightn#t have been a normal funeral for BJ today, but I know the family and all of us are determined that he will eventually get the sort of thanksgiving service that he so richly deserves once the current coronavirus emergency eases.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north.

Elected representatives from across the north west have called on the Executive to sign off on a medical school at Magee and match funding for Derry’s City Deal. The Executive will meet today and SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin today said that with three weeks to get it over the line it must be top of their agenda. “I urge all Executive Ministers to make a call this week. Let’s get it done, together,” she added. googletag.cmd.push An Ulster University spokesperson stated that it is steadfast in its commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point, and to future proof care provision across Northern Ireland. “The University’s completed Outline Business Case was submitted to the Department of Health on st October and we are hopeful that it will be reviewed by the Minister as soon as possible. “We continue to work with the General Medical Council to gain full accreditation. The GMC’s Stage  process can only be completed when it recommends progression to Stage , and that is only possible when a funding decision is confirmed. googletag.cmd.push “To complete the next stages with the GMC in preparation and readiness for a  intake of students, confirmation of a funding commitment is required by the end of May.” The department of health is readying its own business case for medical expansion in Northern Ireland but gave no assurances that a medical school will be based in Derry. Meanwhile, another government department, that for the economy, has told the Derry News that Ulster University’s business case for expansion to , full-time students requires ‘signicant work’. Long-running plans for a medical school at Ulster University’s Magee campus have been plagued by set-backs. A revised timeline targeted student enrolment in . The Derry News asked the department whether it expects the medical school to be approved and for medical students to enrol at Magee next year. In response, a Department of Health spokesperson said: “The establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach. “The Department of Health has been clear that there are two separate business case processes in relation to the development of a Graduate Entry Medical School. “The first process, which has been under way since , has involved signicant assistance from departmental officials on the development of Ulster University’s own business case. “Ulster University has been grateful for this assistance, which has ensured that their business case meets the standards within government financial guidance.” He added: “The second process is the development of the Department of Health’s own business case which will outline the need to be addressed by any expansion of medical education. “That business case will be formally submitted to the Minister very shortly. It will be appreciated that the department’s immediate and overriding priority has been the local response to the Coronavirus pandemic. “The Department of Health must ensure that any proposal represents value for money for health and social care. It is for the Executive to collectively decide on the best approach for Northern Ireland as a whole.” COMMITMENTS There was renewed optimism in January of this year when a deal was agreed by Northern Ireland’s political parties to restore devolved government three years after it collapsed. The New Decade, New Approach document contains firm commitments to a Magee Medical School from both the British and Irish governments. It states: “The Executive will expand university provision at Magee in line with commitments made by the previous Executive, including through the establishment of a Graduate Entry Medical School.” Furthermore, under the section outlining the UK government’s financial and economic commitments to Northern Ireland it says: “Capital and resource funding for the Medical School in Derry subject to the Northern Ireland Executive’s approval of the project.” While the Irish government adds that it is ‘willing in principle to contribute to capital investment to support expanded provision at Ulster University Magee Campus, alongside the commitment made as part of this agreement by the UK Government.’ The commitment made by the previous Executive was for , full-time students at Magee. In   there were , full-time students enrolled at Magee – , overall. Five years previous,  , there were , full-time enrolments – , overall. In a statement to the Derry News, spokesperson for the Department for the Economysaid it is committed to engaging with Ulster University regarding expansion of its Magee campus, including taking account of priorities set out in New Decade, New Approach. “The university confirmed in correspondence to the Department in September  that it has remained committed to securing expansion of its Magee campus, and at the same time confirmed that the business case required updating prior to any consideration by the Department or Executive. “The Department also recognises, however, that the business case requires signicant work.” The Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

Taking to Twitter the Sinn Feacutein Vice-President said: Delighted that the Executive has agreed to match fund Derry  Strabane City Deal Inclusive Future Fund of pound million transformative for Derry and the NW  goes some way to redress decades of underinvestment after years of hard work by political, community  business leaders. In a statement to the Derry News over the weekend Derry City  Strabane District Council said that ‘all project proposals’ have been submitted to the government at this stage. googletag.cmd.push It is a year since it was announced that the Derry region will receive pound million from the UK Government. The package - pound million for the Derry and Strabane City Deal and poundm for the new Inclusive Future Fund - aims to boost the economic potential of the city and wider region. It has now been matched by the NI government bringing the overall total to poundm. Last week, deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee Sinead Mclaughlin asked Minister Diane Dodds for an update on Derry’s City Deal. The Minister said the North West deal is ‘still being worked on’ and she ‘hopes Heads of Terms will be signed off in May or June’. She added that ‘signicant work has gone into it’. googletag.cmd.push Heads of Terms is a document which sets out the terms of a commercial transaction agreed in principle between parties in the course of negotiations. In November of last year the local council stated that this document would be signed-off within weeks. Once it is signed, work will progress on the preparation of a portfolio of outline business cases for the full range of projects, a process expected to take - months. Alongside this, confirmation is needed of required revenue funding to support capital investment, in particular in relation to the proposed Graduate Entry Medical School. A spokesperson for the local council said it is continuing to engage with partners and stakeholders to progress with a pathway and timeline for bringing forward the City Deal to the next stage. All project proposals have been submitted to government at this stage and Council continues to work with Government to advance with the signing of the Heads of Terms. She added: “Much has already been achieved in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects, the proposed governance structures and the processes and timelines involved since the initial City Deal funding announcement. “Discussions in relation to Northern Ireland Government ‘match funding’ to the UK Government poundm Future Fund element of the funding package are continuing.” In terms of the Graduate Medical School and the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus, the council spokesperson said that these are ‘key catalyst regeneration projects’. They have been described as critical to achieving growth and prosperity for Derry and the wider North West City region. “The Mayor last week led calls for the immediate sign off on the approval and long-term commitment of funding for the Graduate Entry Medical School at Ulster University’s Magee campus. “The project has cross party support and there is widespread acknowledgement that it is a hugely important project for the city and wider North West region. “Derry City and Strabane District Council has voted unanimously on a number of occasions in support of the project, acknowledging its signicance to the North West and to Northern Ireland as a whole. “The development of the Medical School and the expansion of Magee are intrinsically linked and will contribute to the overall growth of the City Region alongside the City Deal proposals.” Meanwhile, the Department of Finance voiced its support for the establishment of a medical school in Derry saying it is one of the priorities of the restored Executive in New Decade, New Approach.

Speaking in Westminster in November  Mark Durkan made the case for a City Deal for Derry. In my own constituency, people would love to see city deal status even within our devolved settlement for the city of Derry. We need to look at this in a more fluid way and to get away from the politics and find the democracy, he said. Today, SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood has welcomed the announcement of Executive match-funding for City Deals after the party first raised the proposals over five years ago. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said that Derry’s City Deal has the potential to transform the North West economy, driving new investment and attracting new jobs. Colum Eastwood MP said: “The SDLP has been fighting hard for fully charged City Deals with the power and potential to transform the North’s economy for over five years. Despite the initial disinterest from the Executive, we have always maintained that these deals would have a signicant impact on our ability to reimagine infrastructure, attract new jobs and stimulate economic growth. “In the talks that restored the Executive, I made it a personal priority to secure resource for university expansion in Derry. Investing in skills and providing our talented young people with the opportunity to live, work and set down roots here is essential to building sustainable communities that thrive. googletag.cmd.push “This has been a long time coming. We have been forced to wait for far too long for the chance to build more for our people and our communities. Now that we’ve secured the potential of the City Deal, we can’t take our foot off the pedal. We need to turn the page on the years of neglect and underinvestment by expanding our university, investing in our young people and delivering new opportunities.” Executive confirmation of a multi-million package for Derry has been warmly welcomed by Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson as ‘transformative for the entire north west region’. The Foyle MLA was commenting after the Stormont Executive today confirmed match-funding for Derry’s planned City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This is a hugely positive day for the north west and represents the culmination of a great deal of work over the last number of years,” Martina Anderson said. “Confirmation of the match funding means we now have a package of pound million between the City Deal and Inclusive Growth Deal. “This package will be transformative for the entire North West region and required the collective attention and action of the Executive, both governments and other partners. “Following years of unrelenting Tory austerity which has deprived Derry, Strabane and the wider region of much-needed public services and investment, we can see the clear benefits of having a local Executive in place. “Crucial to this has been the role of Sinn Feacutein Finance Minister Conor Murphy and his determination to ensure that this administration redresses regional inequalities by investing where it is required. “While we will always have much to do, particularly in the face of a global pandemic crisis, this funding and last week’s rescue package for City of Derry Airport will be central to our economic recovery when the crisis has ended. “It will also be fundamental to ensuring we realise the vast economic potential of the entire north west region in the longer term.” Meanwhile, Foyle DUP MLA Gary Middleton also welcomed the approval of match funding for the City Deal and Inclusive Future funding package by Executive Ministers this afternoon.Mr Middleton said,“I wholeheartedly welcome the announcement today of match funding for the Londonderry and Strabane City Deal and Inclusive Future Funds. This doubles the total funding pot to over poundmillion, adding to the funding already secured through the UK Government.This will allow for progress on some of the key projects such as the Maritime Museum at Ebrington, the Walled City Experience and the redevelopment of Queens Quay.The DUP ensured that City Deals were part of the Confidence and Supply agreement in  with the aim of ensuring that all of Northern Ireland benefited. The additional funding for all City Deals announced today is welcome news during this dficult time.I particularly want to put on record my thanks to my party colleagues within the executive and all parties who worked collectively with all of the key stakeholders over the past few years to get this over the line. This is a signicant step forward.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sport Psychologist Dr Noel Brick is currently involved with Slaughtneil hurlers and has worked with Derry senior footballers. Michael McMullan asked him how athletes should approach lock-down. Its been  days since Leo Varadkar stood on the steps of Washingtons Blair House and insisted that all outdoor mass gatherings of more than  people be cancelled. Our world, has we knew it, has changed. Within hours of the announcement, sporting bodies put their wheels in motion to cancel games and clubs closed their gates to collective training. googletag.cmd.push While Brick, a Kerry man living in Ballycastle, accepts most athletes are driven by the desire to compete and beat others, they often have a dference psyche. He is a lecturer in Sport and Exercise Psychology at the Coleraine campus of Ulster University, has studied to PhD level at University of Limerick and holds a Masters from Staffordshire University. Brick has a background in long-distance running and has managed his own fitness testing business. He is well-placed to assess the needs of the sporting world, albeit in very surreal circumstances. “A lot of athletes are self-driven in the goals that they set for themselves,” he said. “A lot of those goals are not just about competition, they are about improving themselves by getting fitter, getting stronger or improving their skills.” googletag.cmd.push The important thing now, Brick feels, is to reset any goals. Special consideration should be made to aspects an athlete can measure. “Even though competition is very important, through the normal training cycle, there is that competition with themselves and it is about getting better. It is those type of goals that become really important now. These are things that are under your own control and you can reference yourself.” WHAT NEXT  So much of sport planning is about tapering down and peaking at the business end of competition. Coaches often have plans broken down into weeks and even days. Thats all up in the air, but any work done will be worth it, as Brick explains. “Itwill pass and we will come to a time when we do get back to competition. Normal might be dferent for a while, but eventually we will get back. It is recognising that too. Whatever training athletes are doing right now, it will become beneficial.” “Through a normal season you dont always have the time to improve on the things you might get better at. Now, you can reframe it as an opportunity to work on something to get better at and when we do get backyou are a better player.” Inidual work would be aerobic fitness, increasing strength and acceleration, as well as working on technical skills. Its about getting your weak side up to a level you can use under pressure and speeding up the execution of skills. It could be something as simple as rehabbing an injury. What that target is, is irrelevant, but Bricks message is consistent. “It is that competition with yourself and looking at your own improvement. It is something you can control and work on and measure. “There are so many things about this situation at the minute, and this is le in general, that we dont have control over. We dont know when it will end. “We have control over the small things, like washing our hands, but we have no control over when sport happens again and le gets back to normal. “It is about the things you can control right now...working on things like your touch, on your acceleration – you have complete control over these things.” “It is hugely important as we manage our emotions, as we go through this. If you are focussing on things you cant control...you are going to feel anxious, down and all those negative things.” CONNECTIONS Aside from the competitive streak, the sporting environment is one of inclusion. Dressing room banter and the slagging around training breeds a team spirit. After a stressful day at work, exercise and collective training is a welcome release. Without the regular bond, it presents a mental strain. “For our own mental health, it is so important to stay connected to people we normally connect with,” Brick stresses. It is important for team environments to still foster that togetherness, evenit is an articial way, via video conferencing. “You are apart from each other, you are doing a bit of training together but separately. That connection is massively important. “We all take part in sport because we love taking part, but we also enjoy the company of the people we take part with. Keeping that companionship and connectivity is so important. “We are physically distancing and socially isolating, but through that, it is important that we dont completely socially disconnect from other people. It only has benefits and one is for our own mental health.” To conclude, Brick highlighted an non-sport theme he has noticed with many of his students and clients. “People are taking the time to slow down to a certain extent, to reconnect with what is important in le and spend time with family. “That is a positive. We get wrapped up in our work bubble or our sport bubble, we forget about the important things.” RELATED - Derry GAA doctor on the importance of exercise. Click here...

Most of the club football I have watched over the past decade has been senior league matches my own club Ballinascreen have been involved in or the club championship, when I try to attend all the games as I love watching them. So apologies to some of the great players out there who have been outstanding at intermediate and junior level, I’ve kept it to the senior club  here. Michael Conlan Dedication and a serious quest for goalkeeping excellence were his traits, a key part of the three in a row Ballinderry side in -. The final of , in particular, Mickey C’s width and accuracy in his kick outs to his teams ‘four in midfield’ tactic was key to their victory that day. Fine shot stopper too, made his body big, gave the forward less to shoot at. Edges out Antoacutein McMullan and Thomas Mallon. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran Mullan Selected not so much for his defensive skills, as his attacking runs from the full back line for Eoghan Rua, playing a key part in their two county titles of  and . Loved to win ball out in front of his opponent and destroyed many a forward’s resolve by racing forward repeatedly, often up the right hand side of the pitch. Loved the wide open space at Owenbeg, in particular, where his pace was there for all to see. Brendan Rogers With serious pace and raw talent, Brendan transforms the way we think about modern full backs. His forays up the pitch often veered over to the sidelines and racing - yards up the pitch and nobody could catch him. Instrumental in Slaughtneils four in a row and his importance to the team was illustrated last year when he was hampered by injury. Incredible dual player. googletag.cmd.push Karl McKaigue Best man marker in the county, his one on one stats are astonishing against star opponents. Can play a bit too, but tends to keep it simple and save his energies for his defensive duties. Keeps it clean too, quiet, no-nonsense, great reader, interceptions, timing of the tackle superb these are his main traits. Ciaran McFaulBetter known for playing at midfield for Glen, or even in the forward line, but he is as complete a player as there is in Derry club football at present. Great ball carrier, his pinpoint passes often put it on a plate for his full forwards. Great long range scorer as well, but it’s his ‘lead by example’ attitude with Glen that impresses me. Chrissy McKaigue Undoubtedly the driving force behind Slaughtneil’s phenomenal run to four county and three Ulster titles. Fierce will to win, excellent athlete, a ball carrier, dictates the play, his tour de force against Diarmuid Connolly and St Vincents in the  All-Ireland semi final was as good an inidual display as I have seen, racing forward to score four outstanding long range points. Sean Leo McGoldrick Another great ball carrier, an orchestrator, extremely comfortable and elusive on the ball, plays almost like a quarter back at times for his club. Part of the famous McGoldrick clan that have played a huge part in putting Eoghan Rua on the footballing map with an incredible two county titles in  and . Enda Muldoon Big Enda had it all, great fielder, outstanding passer, long range points of either foot, excellent free taker. Played well over two decades with Ballinderry winning eight county titles and, of course two Ulster’s and an All-Ireland club. Always did the business when it counted most as well. One of the all time greats of Derry football, and modest with it. Privileged to have been a team mate for several years. Patsy Bradley The most spectacular sight in Derry football was Patsy taking off and ‘leppin’ above and across several opponents, attempting a miraculous catch. You never knew where, or even how, he was going to land, but more often than not, he either emerged with the ball or got a big fist to it. A fierce competitor, and tremendous athlete, he was the Slaughtneil folk hero that got the crowd roaring and inspired his team every match without fail. Danny Heavron Danny has been a shining example for his club right throughout this decade. Has played effectively in defence as a sweeper, at midfield, or anywhere in the forward line. A great athlete, a playmaker, a great score taker from play and frees, Danny came back from several career threatening injuries to lead Magherafelt to a memorable county title win in . Mark Lynch Extremely powerful runner with the ball, two great feet, fine fielder, accurate free taker often putting up a big scoring total. Could play equally effectively at midfield, number  or full forward. Another player who has combined an outstanding county career whilst giving his all for his club, Banagher. I chose Mark just ahead of Christopher Bradley who was majestic at number  in Slaughtneil’s run to their first Ulster Club title in . Conleith Gilligan Along with Enda, he was the outstanding club player in the county for at least  years from  until his seventh county medal in . Extremely hard to dispossess , evasive, some absolutely outstanding scores of either foot. Brushed off a lot of crap from opponents and just got on with the football. Infectious character who was an outstanding servant for Ballinderry. Paddy Bradley Paddy was still a seriously good forward for Glenullin in the first six or so years of the past decade. His first touch was outstanding. Raced out to the ball, sometimes double marked, controlled it first go either with a catch or palm down to himself, then literally fired it over, straight as an arrow, with unerring accuracy, often from - yards out. Derry’s best ever forward in my letime. If it was a team of the last four years alone, young Shane McGuigan of Slaughtneil would undoubtedly have been chosen, a class act. Colm McGoldrickDeceptively languid style, but Colm has been a consistently top club player for Eoghan Rua right throughout the past decade since their vivacious first county title in . Always finds space against even the tightest opponent, the target man, wins serious ball down the channel, good in the air and has scored umpteen goals for his team over the years. A real pity he was never tempted to give the county team a proper rattle as I believe he would have been a huge asset. Just ahead of Emmett McGuckin. Benny Heron Outstanding player for Ballinascreen over the past decade, a fantastic ’turn on a sixpence’ style has destroyed many an opponent. Great finisher, goals and points, he has rattled up some serious tallies. If I was managing Benny I’d have him up top close to goal every time, where he is a deadly assassin. However, a sublime playmaker further out the field as well, with great stamina.Eoghan Brown, another great club forward, was also considered here. RELATED - Michael McMullans selection.

Her death on Saturday morning at Altnagelvin Hospital has left a profound sense of sadness among her friends and neighbours in the street, which she called her home for so many years. As her remains were brought to Long Tower church on Sunday evening, neighbours stopped to remember a special lady, known for her warm generosity and heart of gold. It was a journey that Bridget Carroll had made thousands of times before, to a church that became her second home. googletag.cmd.push Affectionately known as ‘Wee Bridget’ to all her family and friends, Bridget was a daily Communicant until chronic illness took hold several years ago. At every Benediction service, Holy Hour, Parish Retreat, and Stations of the Cross, Bridget could be found in her familiar seat at the back of the church. Indeed she was a particular devotee of the yearly parish retreat and loved getting the traditional new outfit for the last day. Born in Kilkenny on July , , Bridget came to live at Nazareth House in Fahan as an infant, and received her education at Nazareth House in Bishop Street. googletag.cmd.push Her first job was working in the Nazareth House care home where she loved caring for the elderly residents and listening to their stories. Bridget moved to Dublin to work in the Mater Hospital with her best friend Kathleen, and stayed in the Fair City for  years. However Bridget missed the sense of home she felt in her adopted Derry, and ed to the city where she settled into le working at a number of cafes in the town, becoming a familiar face to many. For many years she lived in the iconic Rossville Flats in the Bogside, and she was delighted when she was relocated to her new home in Bishop Street when the flats were marked for demolition. Bridget’s many friendships formed the centre of her le, always staying in touch with her childhood friend Kathleen Smith who is now living in Dublin, Rita McDaid, Monica Gransha, and Kathleen Doherty from Sunbeam Terrace. You knew she had come for a visit when you heard the doorbell ring, the door open, and her familiar voice shout out – ‘It’s only me!’ The  year old loved to have a chat and always kept up with the local news buying every local newspaper each week. Bridget was a member of many groups often giving her time as a volunteer in Termonbacca, with Cursillo, St Joseph’s Young Priests Society, as a regular chapel cleaner and a parish reader. Bridget also loved travelling and was the first to sign up for any bus runs in the parish. Her favourite run without question was to the pilgrimage site of Knock, but her trips also took her as far as Lourdes on six occasions, Fatima, Buncrana, and Lough Derg. She spoke often of her devotion to the Blessed Mother and Padre Pio, it was this faith that helped her in recent years as she battled her deteriorating health. Several years ago she moved from her flat at the bottom of Bishop Street, to Alexander House at the top of Bishop Street. Here, Bridget found a new sense to the meaning of home. She formed new friendships with the staff and fellow residents, and received dedicated and loving care around the clock. Bridget Carroll will be remembered for her straight talking, unforgettable laugh, loyal friendship and beautul spirit. She often said that even though she was not born here, she felt that she was a Derry woman at heart. Many will miss chatting to her and giving her a wave as she made her way to and from the city centre for her shopping. Bishop Street will never be the same again without her.

He sat down with Michael McMullan to talk about how he almost missed out on Derry’s greatest hour. When Brian McGilligan shakes your hand, it stays shook. Locked, like a wench. It reminds you of the toughness of a man who turned the midfield battlegrounds of Ireland upside down. A man who Ireland manager Kevin Heffernan took one glance at and knew he would not need baby-sitting when faced with any form thuggery the Australians could heave at him. The man that, alongside Anthony Tohill, formed the perfect midfield partnership. A duo that dozed all before it. googletag.cmd.push He is one of six players to start and finish all five games on the way to the historic summit of . It is put to him that he played a central part in something that has never been equalled. “Do you think so sur ” came the instant reply. With  minutes of the All-Ireland Final gone Niall Cahalane’s mis-directed fist pass is too high and squirms through the fingers of Teddy McCarthy. McGilligan laps up the gt before slotting over his third score of the campaign. Four minutes previous, with Cork - to - ahead, he was involved in the move that led to Johnny McGurk’s point - Derry’s first of a jittery start. googletag.cmd.push The midfield warrior’s input didn’t end there. Wing-forward Barry Coffey had a height advantage over Johnny McGurk. The pre-game chat suggested that goalkeeper John Kerins was expected to exploit it. Kerins’ th minute kick-out was angled towards Coffey, who was hugging the Cusack Stand sideline. McGilligan scampered across - effortlessly almost - before thundering through Coffey for the breaking ball. His physique didn’t suggest he was fast. He was deceptive. “Over  metres nobody could touch me,” McGilligan states. “Tony Scullion would be close, Joe Brolly over the first  or  yards would have been fast but I would have stuffed them after that. “Every evening after school you were running and feeding sheep. I was naturally fit and was carrying no weight.” In Coffey’s wake and with the leather in his grasp, McGilligan thumped the ball goalwards. It was the days when you had to fight your own corner. He had done his bit. Now the forwards needed to man up. Enda Gormley nipped ahead of Cahalane to flick the wet ball into the path of Damian Cassidy. Cassidy’s left-footed kick evaded Cahalane’s intended block and hung in the air above full-back Mark O’Connor before Seamus Downey punched to the net and Derry were two points ahead. The measure of a leader is how they respond to adversity. As Derry’s landmark Sunday flirted with failure, before it had left the starting blocks, McGilligan was involved in three of the game’s key moments. The craved All-Ireland title would follow, but it so nearly passed him by. *** It’s a Wednesday night in the McGilligan household. Like a scene from game day in any corner of Ireland. Brian Oacuteg and Fiontan are gathering their gear for a game. Cathair points me in the direction of the farmyard. After a day on the site, Brian senior is out feeding the stock. In full view below, through the open side of the shed, is the Benedy. We head up to the house. Traversing back through the living room is like walking through a museum. The walls are scarcely visible, around framed pictures of Dungiven, Derry and Ulster teams. Charting the career of one of the Derry’s most famous sons. But hurling was his first love. He was reared in the cottages at Owenbeg and went to Dernaflaw school which, despite its small size, also produced Joe Brolly to Derry’s winning team. “The Damperwas there and we had a pretty good hurling team and won a couple of Feacuteiles,” McGilligan recalled. It was pre-Kevin Lynch’s and Dernaflaw would always be beating Dungiven at underage. McGilligan’s football career began as a goalkeeper at U and U. The genuine interest wasn’t there but with flailing numbers, he played almost out of necessity. Now at ‘the big school’ in Dungiven, the oldest of a family of six was now needed on the farm. Spare time was a limited commodity. “You had to go and look sheep and feed them. That was every evening. My fatherwas working and it was up to me. My motherwould lt me at the school gates.” An U title in  was followed two years later by U glory but it wasn’t until the minor grade, under George Murphy, that he made the breakthrough. A championship game with Magherafelt came around the corner and his dual with Joe Beattie, who had a huge reputation at the time, changed the direction of McGilligan’s career. “They threw me out at centre-half back to mark him,” he outlined. Dungiven went on to win two minor championships, but he never was able to break into the mould at county level. In his final year, , he watched on as an unused substitute as Cork beat Derry in the All-Ireland Minor Final. “They put on every Tom, Dick and Harry. It was all about who you were, who your father was and what pedigree you had. They weren’t going to put a rahery like me on,” McGilligan said. As he admits himself, there is a stubbornness. He stuck at it and took his chances when they came. One Sunday, Dungiven reserve manager Liam Harrycoaxed McGilligan from a corn field to make up the numbers for a trip to Ballinderry. Never an easy place to go to. “It was like something from a ‘Carry on’ film,” McGilligan described. “A boy was going to hit a penalty and somebody would run up behind him and trip him. It was the Wild West - there is no other way to say it.” The experience of the reserve and senior games on a Sunday was a lesson for a decorated career that would follow. Andy Murphy came in as manager in . He saw something in McGilligan and pushed him towards the team. His instincts paid off. A year later at Ballinascreen, a star-studded Magherafelt side led Dungiven - to -, as the county final ticked into the final moments. Liam McElhinney’s kick hung in the air. It was the last hurrah. Out of nowhere, McGilligan got a fist to the ball – punching to the net. It lives long in Dungiven folklore and that winning goal helped him to the first of five county medals. His career began to take root. *** It was Sunday, June   at Omagh’s Healy Park. Derry were trailing Tyrone by ‘five or six points’ and Jim McKeever called Brian McGilligan from the dug-out. There was no warm up required. “I was mad keen to get on. I thought I should have started,” McGilligan recalls of his debut. “I went on and I won a couple of balls and we turned it, but Noel McGinn hit a wonder strike.” The goal ended Derry’s hopes but Tyrone would later have a major part to play in McGilligan’s summer. The Kevin Barry’s club in Philadelphia came calling and he headed across the pond. As time went by, he felt he may never . “I wasn’t for coming back. I had work and plenty of money...everything…and the weather was favourable. I was playing football and hurling – it was a home away from home.” With no mobile phones, communication wasn’t as it is now. The weekly phone call kept tabs on how everyone was back home. “Every time I would ring, my mother would say ‘that boy Heffernanwas ringing again’ you would need to ring him.” If the Ireland manager wasn’t ringing the McGilligan household, ‘Heffo’ was ringing then Derry official Patsy Mulholland. The calls continued. Homesickness began to creep in ‘a wee bit’ and with the chance to represent his country, it eventually swayed McGilligan and he dialled Heffernan’s number. Still in Philadelphia, would he be guaranteed a seat on the plane to Oz  Onlyhe was playing the football he was before be left, insisted Heffernan. “You know yourself - boys go outand go off the rails and are messing about. I wasn’t at that. Yes, I enjoyed a beer but I was working hard every day,” McGilligan continues. The football was a good work out, ‘a couple of’ evenings a week. The system wasn’t abused. After a weekend of thinking and a Mondayhome, Heffo booked McGilligan and Dermot McNicholl, who had also spent the summer in Philadelphia, into Tyrone training on the Tuesday night. Art McRory was putting the finishing touches to their  All-Ireland Final with Kerry and had a savage routine in place for McGilligan. “It was strange because we were two Derry men. There was no love lost but we were well looked after – we were treated as part of the .” McGilligan battled with Plunkett Donaghy, Audi Hamilton and Harry McClure in the training games. “The only dference was -we were doing  sprints, I was made do five or six more. If there was half a dozen sI would be doing  of them.” It was the same in the gym sessions. The first set was fine, the second and third set had McGilligan going around on his knees. “I got a lot of abuse. It was bordering on brutality. I remember Art talking to Fr Brian D’Arcy, who was down watching training. “Art said ‘look at the big Derry b*****d, that’s the place for him – on his knees’ and I felt like getting up and striking him.” As the Tyrone sessions were tapering down, McNicholl and McGilligan’s time was up. They thanked Tyrone for having them there and wished them well for the final. McRory was appreciative of the bite the two Derry men brought to their preparations but had a final word of apology for big Brian. The extra training was ‘preferential treatment’ at the request of Heffernan. “The whole thing was pre-planned but it worked,” added McGilligan. He was on the trip to Australia, where he played at full-back as Ireland recovered from a first test defeat to win the series -. Playing in front of average attendances of ,, McGilligan was now an icon. Home for good, he was midfield in Derry’s Ulster winning team. The seeds for Sam were sown. *** The summer of  was his first time playing in the mecca of GAA. It was ‘a privilege’ but age wasn’t on their side. “We had an old team. Plunkett Murphy and Joe Irwin – boys like that. They were all good footballers but there was no youth coming in. “I quite honestly thought we’d never be back in an All-Ireland semi-final even. Holy Jesus, to get playing in Croke Park, this is unreal. “Ulster was very hard to win. It wasn’t like Munster, where it was down to two teams.” Following his All-Star and a trip to America, rubbing shoulders with the best Ireland had to offer, McGilligan began thinking. “They were no better than you, but they were in a better set-up – a better oiled machine,” he offered, referring to the players from other counties. “They weren’t superhumans, when you were playing with them, you were every bit as fast as them.” Back home, it was a lot dferent. “Derry was in turmoil. You were going to matches and counting to seeyou had enough men to play. We played Down at Drumsurn and we were down to the bare bones. “We hadn’t even a manager. Mickey Moran had to step in to take the team. There was  or  out at training.” Fr Sean Hegarty, a confidant of Eamonn Coleman, managed Armagh against Derry in  would act as an intermediary of sorts. “Wee Hegarty came in and I honestly think he steadied the ship. I didn’t know a lot about him but he was a gas man. He was the sort of man I would go to give my confessions to – he was a shrewd man.” With minor teams beginning to produce players, the recipe began to thicken. But like most of his career, McGilligan had to wait. Down and Donegal would feast at the top table first. “Tohill and these boys were coming in at the start of the s but by  they were starting to come of age.” Handing Down an  point hammering in the first round was the perfect tonic. “You start to believe in yourself but it could have gone pear-shaped. We rode our luck in a couple of games.” “Even the bad dayin Clones, it could’ve went either way. There was a ball that went down the field and I went like mad after it. Martin McHugh passed it and I got my hand to it and it came out again.” The small margins where games were won and lost. In the All-Ireland semi-final, Derry were in arrears against Dublin and McGilligan’s  doubts raised their head again. “It was the same auld story. It’s not going to be back again,” he recalled thinking. In the lead-up to the game, he had asked his fatherhe was going to the game. He wasn’t. It wasn’t a surprise. “My mother was dferent,” McGilligan outlined. “But he was never at a match in his le. He didn’t have an interest. He was a typical workaholic and farmer, but he said he’d go to the final.” Whatthey didn’t get there  His father’s answer was the perfect comeback. “He said ‘well,that’s your attitude, then don’t you go either’ – it was as quick as that,” McGilligan added. His son did show up alright. Few can forget the thunderous shoulder on Jack Sheedy. The two met later in the year, by chance, and the Dubliner told McGilligan he was still sore. That’s the brute strength he brought. The Dubs couldn’t move it and neither could Cork. So Gerard McGilligan would get a chance to see his son play. And on the biggest day of them all. “My wewent down,” Brian recalled. “Our young girlwas only a year and Brian Oacuteg was only born. She had more bother with the auld boy than the two weans.” Following the final whistle McGilligan still recalls heading towards the Hogan Stand, where there was a cordon of Gardai surrounding the steps. “I mind crawling on my hands and knees, in between somebody’s legs. I wasn’t fit to walk, I was beat black and had people jumping on me.” The celebration banquet in the Shelbourne Hotel was similar. It couldn’t cope. McGilligan, Tony Scullion and Kieran McKeever – with their partners – were among those unable to get a seat in the mainroom. “It was like something out of a Monty Python sketch - it was hilarious. There were no seats for us. It wasn’t big enough to hold thefor starters. I actually saw somebody move name pieces and sit on the Bishop’s seat.” Seated in dferent room, upstairs, they began to tuck into their soup, one of the RTE staff came upstairs. The Sunday Game was about to go on air but McGilligan was reluctant to go downstairs. He was ‘embarrassed’ as others were forced to give up their seat in the middle of the . Even back at the Airport Hotel, later that night, where Derry were staying, there was only a ‘wee hatch’ open to serve up to  people, including Henry Downey and a certain Sam Maguire. With the cup needing filled, McGilligan issued a ‘bit of advice’ to the night porter and eventually two shutters opened on the bar. It was Monday before the occasion began to seep fully into the mind. Now it was real. *** The Moy was packed and when Derry bus-driver Benny Vincent opened the door - in came Plunkett Donaghy. The previous season, he spilled Anthony Tohill’s ‘’ into the net in the league final to start the ball rolling on Derry’s odyssey. This was dferent. This was a tribute to the sons of Ulster bringing home the Sam. “You had the Garda escort coming out of Dublin and you were stopping in every town,” McGilligan recalls. “There were thousands of people waiting on us on a lorry in every town on the way up.” In Cookstown there was a Loyalist road block. Plan B was to ert via Coalisland. But McGilligan instructed Vincent to head on up the town – as far as they could go. There were thousands of Tyrone people wanting a glance at Sam. “It was unheard of for a team from the North. Down had done it before and it wasn’t new to them - it was new to Derry.” The homecoming seemed to go on forever. In every town, before they were greeted by the huge crowd in Maghera, outside Glen club, before the cup was taken to the four corners of the county. When it was McGilligan’s turn to have the cup, he paraded it around the homes of the Benedy. Back to the days when Liam Harry came rounding him up to make up the numbers. His career had now come full circle. He hosted a night in his house. It was packed, with cars strewn alongside the road. “There was a death up in the Benedy,” added McGilligan, remembering the night vividly. A stranger to the area saw the commotion and stopped off. “He said to somebody ‘where’s the remains at’ – he saw all the cars and thought it was the wake house. He laughed and away he went.” *** The glory days ended abruptly. With Ciaran McCabe’s winning goal for Down in , Derry’s world came crashing down. There was no back door and Derry’s All-Ireland dreams were in tatters. McGilligan laments the  years since meeting Sam. “Any other county would have got their act together. Too many boys partied, lived the high le and thought it was only matter of turning up. “We definitely should have won another one. The players were good enough, you can’t pinpoint any one thing. It was the perfect storm. There was a whole lot of things going on behind. You see where things have gone,” he continued. “We are still as far away from winning another one. We are starting from the bottom again – we are in ision four.” That aside, McGilligan is content on how his GAA career panned out. “It kept me on the straight and narrow. Everybody has their vices and the GAA was a vice for me. If it wasn’t football it was hurling.” Nulling the impact of Joe Beattie, punching home a county final winning goal and answering Kevin Heffernan’s call tofrom America. The important markers in the career of one of Derry’s famous sons. RELATED - Gerry McElhinney - the greatest showman. Click here...

Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators.

The general population can take exercise within km of their homes instead of km from next Tuesday, May . The government have also included, in their road map for reopening society and business a plan for the phasedof sporting activities on the island. googletag.cmd.push The roll back on restrictions will be done over five phases. Phase one begins on May  and there are three weeks between each roll back.  In phase one, the government plan to open tennis courts, golf courses and sports pitches, as long as social distancing is still observed. A maximum of four people will be allowed to participate in an activity at the one time. Phase two will permit training, in small groups, but no matches. Phase three promises behind closed doors activities where arrangements are made to maintain social distance, while in Phase four, soccer and GAA canwith a limited number of spectators. This would hopefully mean, from a local perspective, that the Desmond and Limerick District soccer leagues could , while in GAA the football and hurling, club championships, could make a welcometo the playing pitches too. Phase four also allows for swimming pools to open. googletag.cmd.push Phase five, August , will allow gyms, contact sports such as boxing, wrestling and rugby to . There too will be restrictions on large sport gatherings, but it seems that inter county matches in the GAA could be back on the cards in August. It is vital to remember however, that should the virus resurface or one of the phases sees an increase in Covid- cases, there is the possibility that the government would roll back a phase and start from there once more. However, there does seem to be light at the end of the tunnel for sports fans and bodies at this time.

The response to the classes has been brilliant and I have kept it on, even though I am teaching PE full-time in Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch.ldquoObviously with COVID- I am off work now and with no GAA or fitness classes I have more time on my hands.ldquoI put out the idea on social media on Friday morning and then spent the weekend putting together the first class to upload Monday morning.ldquoI honestly didnrsquot know what to expect really. I was thinking maybeI managed to pull in a hundred people at pound each, pound would be a reasonable target.But I have really been overwhelmed by the response.Members of her usual weekly classes in Pilates for Paula responded immediately, but her school quickly weighed in behind the effort and her many acquaintances in GAA and camogie.Despite her organisation of the fundraiser, in her words being ldquoa bit last minute, her target was realised eight-fold and she presented a cheque for pound, last week.ldquoI couldnrsquot believe it really. When I saw Instagram stories of Sophie Colgan in New York taking part, Eiliacutes Niacute Chaiside [the Slaughtneil camog], who has been in New Zealand for the past year, signing up, and Sarah Donnelly, the Tyrone footballer in Australia, it just shows you that the people you meet through the GAA will always support each other.Paula last year captained Clonduff to the All-Ireland club title and she has played for Down and Ulster over many years, while her husband Darren is the Down football captain.ldquoThe GAA camogie community is absolutely fabulous. They rallied around my family after Christmas and provided a lot of comfort and again the response has been phenomenal.ldquoCOVID- has challenged the family once more. Clodaghrsquos parents, my brother Darren and his we Carol, live in Coleraine and it has been very dficult for us as a family to support them. What has happened over Easter week has given us all a huge lt and we are very thankful for all that support from our GAA family.ldquoI have got a lot of messages since the last class on Friday and everyone seems to have enjoyed them. A lot had never done exercise like that and now want me to provide more classes online and keep it going for as long as we are all prevented from going back to work.ldquoI think plenty of people are finding the lockdown very tough mentally and I got that back in the messages too, about how they felt a lot more positive after doing the exercise, a lot fresher and ready to face the day.She added: ldquoThe people who supported the fundraiser have helped themselves, helped Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI Research and really supported the Gribben family.You can still contribute to Leukaemia Lymphonania Research by searching for Carol and Darren Gribbenrsquos fundraiser in aid of Leukaemia  Lymphoma NI on Facebook or follow this link https:www.facebook donate  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Delamont.jpg","title":"Delamont remains closed in lockdown  ","story":"DELAMONT Country Park outside Killyleagh is to remain closed to visitors.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has confirmed that the gates to the stunning park on the shores of Strangford Lough will not reopen, despite last weekrsquos decision by Stormont agriculture minister Edwin Poots to reopen Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks.The decision not to allow visitors into Delamont was taken by the leaders of the local councilrsquos main parties during a meeting held via Skype last week and has been welcomed by local councillors Billy Walker and Dermot Curran.Cllr Walker said all the party leaders agreed that is it too soon to reopen Delamont, confirming that the closure decision will be reviewed next month.ldquoThere are real concerns that allowing the public to access the country park could lead to a major surge in visitors which is not what anyone wants at this particular time. The last thing we need is for family picnics and hundreds of other visitors arriving at a time when coronavirus remains a very real and present danger, continued the Rowallane councillor.Cllr Walker described the decision to reopen forest parks as ldquopremature and said Newry, Mourne and Down Council deserved praise for keeping all its country parks closed for the time being.He added: ldquoThe closure decision is being kept under review and I believe that there is still some way to go before council-owned parks will be open to the public.ldquoThere will be people upset that Delamont remains closed, but we all have to adhere to the public advice we have been given in relation to social distancing and, where possible, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Cllr Curran said he supports the decision to keep Delamont closed and praised what he described as the local authorityrsquos ldquocourageous decision.He argued that the big danger with warmer weather and clearer evenings now here is that reopening the country park could lead to a major influx of visitors and that enforcing social distancing measures would be particularly dficult,not impossible.ldquoThere was perhaps a temptation to reopen Delamont given the decision to allow people to access Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, but the local council has stood firm, putting the safety of people front and centre and is to be applauded for doing so, said Cllr Curran.ldquoErring on the side of caution is the right thing to do at this time. It would be an awful situation to reopen the park and for someone to contract coronavirus as a result. The park will reopen at some stage, but not just now. Peoplersquos health and safety must come first.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said despite the decision by Mr Poots to reopen parks managed by the Forest Service all those that the local authority is responsible for, including Delamont, will remain closed.Council officials say that the decision to close Delamont taken on March  remains in place for the time being, but will be reviewed as public health advice guidance develops.ldquoMembers decided that it was too soon to consider reopening parks at this time, said a council spokesman.In addition, he said it was felt that reopening local authority-owned country park would encourageresidents from outside the district to make a non-essential journey to these facilities for exercise, thus increasing the volume of traffic and congestion at these locations and increasing the risk of further spread of COVID- across the district.ldquoThe focus of the council at this time must be the safety of our citizens and implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, said the spokesman.ldquoThe council continues to advise our citizens that the single most important action they can take is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS and save lives..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Doreen.jpg","title":"Doreen to step down after 20 years as leader at Leitrim playgroup  ","story":"A LEITRIM woman, who has been the driving force behind a local playgroup for almost  years, is stepping down.Doreen Shahmohammadi is a familiar face around the village, especially to young people as the leader of Leitrim Community Playgroup.Doreen, her Iranian husband, Reza, and twin sons, Michael and Colm, settled in Leitrim a few years before she began the playgroup in January . She soon experienced a strong sense of community and friendship that has kept them there ever since.She started the playgroup with the support of the local GAA club, Liatroim Fontenoys, which offered her use of their premises to begin with.ldquoIn the first year we went from having five children to  children, she said. ldquoWe had no funding in the first year, but the Fontenoys were very good to us by covering the cost of heating and telephone charges.ldquoBy the second year funding was made available by the Southern Education and Library Board for  pre-school places and it wasnrsquot long before we secured funding to build a purpose-built playgroup which sits within the boundary of the Fontenoys club.ldquoWithin a few years and thanks to additional funding enrolment rose to  places. Depending on the birth rate it has usually remains around the same number each year.Doreen loves to have children around her. In fact, Reza reminds her all the time that she is a magnet in attracting them wherever she goes.Doreen is a very proud mother. Her sons, now , graduated as doctors five years ago and both are working on the frontline during the COVID- pandemic. Colm is working in intensive care, while Michael works between cardiology and intensive care.ldquoOver the years, I have loved, cared for and educated every child that has come to the playgroup as though they were my own children, he says.ldquoI am going to miss them all very much, more than you can ever imagine. I hope Irsquom not to be a stranger to the playgroup after my retirement.Doreen says the current playgroup team, made up of deputy leader Michelle McCabe and temporary assistant, Danielle Clarke, have worked well together over the past few years. Other long term members of staff were Janet King, Tina Owens and Diane Baxter.ldquoThe playgroup has been my le and I have enjoyed welcoming hundreds of children to their pre-school year experience. It is a lovely learning environment to be part of, she continued.ldquoWe are blessed with the children and their families in the community who have entered our setting and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and committees past and present, children, grandparents, childminders and, of course, the wider community who have supported me and who have been so generous over the years.ldquoMost of all, I would like to thank the trustees who have supported me for all these years and provided me with the opportunity to establish an excellent learning environment for pre-school children, not forgetting my sincere thanks to the Fontenoys for all their support and encouragement.She added: ldquoI wish my successor every success and I hope they will enjoy and appreciate every single minute they spend with the children as I have done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Life.jpg","title":"Ex Drumaness man praises Kiwis as country comes out of lockdown  ","story":"A FORMER Drumaness man who has been living in New Zealand for the past  years has this week revealed what le in lockdown has been like Down Under.Barry Brennanrsquos adopted homeland has been praised for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with the country this week emerging from a strict five-week quarantine which included the strictest constraints paced on New Zealanders in modern history.The countryrsquos prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, hailed New Zealanders for their incredible work to ldquobreak the virusrsquos chain of transmission which has allowed the country to downgrade its highest alert level from four to three, with amendedrestrictions expected to be in place for around two more weeks.The move means that many shops have reopened while public gatherings of  people are now permissible for weddings and funerals, with schools also set to reopen. In addition, Kiwis can now fish, hunt, surf, swim and play golf.New Zealand has suffered only , confirmed coronavirus cases and  deaths after moving quickly to impose a lockdown last month, with the easing of quarantine measures paving the way for around , people toto work under a more relaxed regime.Barry mdash who specialises in home renovations and employs several people mdash has not ed to work yet, but is more than happy in the idyllic rural setting of Mangawhai in the North Island just five minutes from the beach, where he lives with his we, Sian, and children Sean, Danny and Liam.The New Zealand government is still asking citizens to stay at home and to practise social distancing, with Barry hoping that it wonrsquot be long before the country again enjoys some sense of normality.And he has the praised prime minister for her approach to COVID-, with Arden arguing that a drastic short-term action would benefit the countryrsquos economy in the long run.On Monday, it was confirmed that there is no widespread underlying community transmission in New Zealand, with Ms Arden warning that the country was not yet out of the woods.ldquoWhen you look at what happened where in the world in relation to coronavirus, the prime minister did a good job, said Barry, who headed to New Zealand with his friend Barry Armstrong in .ldquoI was a qualied carpenter and Barry, who lived just up the road from me, was a bricklayer who had a contact in New Zealand so we headed off on a -month visa to Auckland. Barry stayed for  months before heading home but I am still here, married with three boys.ldquoThe coronavirus has had a worldwide impact and while many people were wondering what would happen in New Zealand, I always had a feeling that the prime minister would go at the pandemic hard and fast and that is exactly what she did.Barry revealed that New Zealanders were told to prepare for lockdown on March  and that two days later a series of strict measures were introduced.ldquoClearly the prime minister had a look at what was happening in other parts of the world before the virus got a hold here and she moved to minimise its impact. I think that she has done an amazing job to be quite honest.ldquoFour and a half weeks after the lockdown measures were implemented, there was only one confirmed coronavirus case in New Zealand at the start of this week. Indeed, the government knows exactly where every case is in the country.Barry said anyone arriving in the country and is suspected of having the virus is quarantined and believes thatthere was ever to be another pandemic in the future, countries would do well to take a close look at what New Zealand did to halt its deadly spread.ldquoEverything really happened so fast here and we did not have that much time to think about what was going in, he continued.ldquoI played golf with the principal of the school my youngest boy attends and he said he did not think NewZealand would go into lockdown. Forty eight hours later we were told it was happening.Barry said the country rightly decided that it wasnrsquot taking any chances and locked everything down, apart from supermarkets, with strict social distancing rules in place.ldquoWe have gone from a level four alert to level three but I am still not back at work as there a lot of iables that I need to consider, explained the former Drumaness man. ldquoIn my line of work I would be close to homeowners so I will just wait until the restrictions ease a bit more.Barry relocated from Auckland to Mangawhai six years ago and home is now a three and a half acre plot where he built a shooting gallery and what he describes as a ldquobit of a golf course. He also looks after a few animals.With no immediateto work on the horizon, Barry is keeping busy mowing lawns and feeding his animals, with a little help from his sons.With his parents, Sean and Mary, still living at the family home at the Cumber Road in Drumaness, Barry says he is in regular contact with them. He said his dad is good with Whatsapp and regularly tells him that New Zealand lamb is cheaper in Ireland than down under.ldquoWe have lots of contact with my parents and are in touch once or twice a week. I also have an older brother, Seamus who lives in Auckland. We both played for Loughinisland GAC. I also keep up-to-date with what is going there via social media and stuff, he continued.ldquoMy brother, Mark, is a former Loughinisland club chairman who was involved in the plans for building the new clubhouse. I also keep tabs on Down GAArsquos fortunes.As Barry waits for the right time toto work, he said that during the lockdown, New Zealanders mostly did what they were told.He added: ldquoThey were sensible and the approach has worked as things are slowly ing to normal, but we know that we have a little way to go yet..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 29%2C 1980  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ndash A new library for Newcastle is to be given priority soon by the South Eastern Education Board, it was claimed this week.The claim came from Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, a Board member, who said she believed that Board members realised they had made a bad mistake and are now prepared to reverse their attitude.Mrs Smyth, addressing a meeting of Down councillors on Monday, explained that she had recently asked the Board for an undertaking that the Newcastle Library project would be given a priority rating for new capital schemes.ldquoI think the whole Board realised they made a bad mistake and they are quite willing to go ahead and get something done quickly, said Mrs Smyth.Mrs Smyth made her surprise announcement after Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue attacked the Boardrsquos attitude over a new library for the seaside town.Mr OrsquoDonoghue claimed that an original Board decision to put Newcastle on a low priority rating was taken without consulting the Boardrsquos chief librarian who was in favour of early attention for Newcastle.He called the lack of consultation and criticised the Board for not responding fully to points raised by a council deputation several months ago.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Chamber of Commerce is beginning to draw up plans for another trade week ndash and such was the success of the last venture that itrsquos been decided to extend this yearrsquos event to ten days.The dates being set aside for the trade week are Thursday, June th to Saturday, June st, and it is hoped that the townrsquos traders will offer many bargains to help attract business.Last yearrsquos trade week was a major success and most businesses in the town have reaped the benefit since. New customers were attracted to the town and quality goods and competitive prices have encouraged many toon a regular basis.The growing stature of the town as a shopping centre has been helped by the introduction of new shops, particularly in the Dromore Street area, and by the good car parking facilities on offer.Market Day every Thursday brings hundreds of people from the surrounding district flooding into the town ndash and with two Market Days cropping up in the new extended trade week this year, the Chamber is hopeful that shopping will hit a new peak in June.QUOILE ndash A concerted effort is being made by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Down District Council to make the -mile stretch of the Quoile River into a fishing paradise.Regarded as one of the best fishing waters in the province, the Quoile is hardly known nationally, and itrsquos the aim of the Tourist Board and the council to make it as popular as the Fermanagh Lakelands, the current number one fishing haven.The joint effort to put the Quoile on the fishing map is being spearheaded by Ian Heaps, the former inidual world champion angler and current member of the English international team, who has been carrying out a survey over the past ten days.And his report could influence the Tourist Board to pump more money into publicising the Quoile to world-wide anglers.Already Heaps has spent ten days fishing the Quoile and its ancillary waters ndash and his expert opinion is that itrsquos one of the best that Northern Ireland has to offer.KILLYLEAGH ndash The Vikings ed to invade Killyleagh this week ndash but this time it was a more peaceful visit.The invaders, instead of arriving by longship to pillage and plunder, came to look over youth provision in the area and they left totally impressed by the friendly reception they received.The unlikely invaders were a group of youth workers from Norway and Spain, who visited the area as part of a five-day study of youth work and facilities in the province.Local stops were at the Seaboard Sailing Centre in Killyleagh, Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Castlewellan and Downpatrick Folk Club.Tuesday afternoon and night was spent in the area, with the first stop for the Norwegians being at the Seaboard centre.STRANGFORD ndash The recently formed Strangford Village Improvement Committee is to seek public support to have an order enforcing the one-way system in the village revoked.The committee discussed the system at their monthly meeting on Thursday and, after hearing of the failure of a meeting between the Department of Environment officials, traffic police and RUC representatives to have something done about it, they decided that the support of the public is needed.The committee chairman told members that the top level meeting had fallen on deaf ears and that nothing could be done about the situation.They had discussed the possibility of altering the system, the ious proposals which the committee had made as alternatives to it, and the fact that the majority of residents did not want the system.Unfortunately the Department rejected all the committeersquos proposals and insisted that the system, in its present form, would have to remain, said the chairman.The chairman had askedthe one-way system would not be made permanent until all attempts to accommodate the residentrsquos wishes had been made but the Department replied that the systemis already permanentand had been made so by Government order. Nothing could be done about it unless the order was revoked.KILLINCHY ndash The st Killinchy Company of the Boys Brigade held its th annual display in the Church Hall on Friday evening.Chairman for the evening was the Rev R A McKee, the inspecting officer was Mr C T Johnston, of st Cargycreevy, and the presentation of prizes was made by Mrs M Moles.The company gave the usual high standard display, with a ied programme of drill, games and sketches, before captain, Raymond Finlay, gave his annual report.Three boys received their Queens Badges, the highest award in the BB, namely Alistair Davidson, Robin Thompson and Samuel Dines.Three had also received their presidentrsquos badges, namely Bill Dunlop, Wesley Blythe and Andrew Bishop, and four had received their Duke of Edinburgh bronze awards, namely David Morrow, Mark Davidson, Robin Thompson and Robert McBurney.DOWNPATRICK ndash A breathtaking two-hour pageant is being drawn up as the centrepiece of this yearrsquos St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick.An outdoor site has already been chosen and plans are well advanced to produce a startling display of battle scenes, comedy scenes, music and games.And to show they mean business the organisers have appointed one of the countryrsquos leading stage producers, Mr Michael Poynor, to act as a full-time director.The site, which is near the Quoile, will resemble a giant film set with authentic costumes and props depicting the time of the earliest settlers in Lecale to the arrival of the Normans.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Kilmegan Youth Club, Castlewellan, triumphed in the final of the South Eastern Education and Library Board Youth Club quiz held in Downpatrick on Monday night.

The online sales are set to continue as marts across the province begin to reopen.Cllr Lewis said the marts have a crucial role to play, allowing farmers to buy and sell livestock, at what is a traditionally a busy time of the year for them. Crucially, he said reopening marts will help with their respective incomes.He said there was ldquosignicant concern when the marts closed last month, with farmers expressing concern that they could find themselves overstocked with animals, particularly store cattle and ped calves.ldquoNews of the gradual reopening of local marts is an important development and will be widely welcomed across the agricultural sector at this time, said Cllr Lewis.The Slieve Croob councillor said DAERA was to be applauded for its decision, particularly given the key role farmers play in supplying the local food chain.ldquoIt is essential that in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public, he continued.ldquoAt this time of year, many farmers are seeking to purchase stock for the grazing season and obviously others are selling their stock through the marts. Dairy farms will also find themselves overstocked with dropped calves that they would normally be selling.Cllr Lewis said there were farmers wishing to sell and buy livestock and it was ldquovital in these uncertain times that farm production continues and that the local supply chain of quality food products can be available to the public.A DAERA spokesman said farmers were key workers and were continuing to provide food for everyone in ldquovery challenging circumstances with part of the food supply chain the ability to trade and sell animals.ldquoStaff within the department have maintained regular contact with livestock mart operators over recent weeks and have been reassured that robust operational protocols, developed by the marts in conjunction with other stakeholders, will enable them to conduct business in a manner that is safe for staff, farmers and buyers and adheres to social distancing requirements, he continued.ldquoFarmers, like all businesses, are facing financial dficulties as a result of COVID-. Being able to trade again at the marts will provide much needed cash flow..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Into.jpg","title":"Into the Blues   Jake signs pro contract with Linfield  ","story":"A TEENAGE local footballer says hersquos ldquoover the moon after signing professional terms with Linfield.Eighteen year-old Jake Corbett, from Dromara, has signed his first professional contract with the Blues after some stellar performances for Linfield Swts.The exciting young player has scored around  goals this season, despite playing in midfield.And he also helped the Swts lt the Steel  Sons Cup as they beat Newington - in the Christmas Day showdown.Jake, who joined the Windsor Park outfit three years ago, has been football mad since the age of ten.He played youth football for Dromore Amateurs, then broke his way into the clubrsquos first team and played in the Amateur League.After spells with Banbridge Town, Lisburn Distillery and Crusaders he joined Linfield at the age of .An attacking central midfielder, he made an immediate impact and firmly established himself in the Swts set-up.His prowess has also earned international honours.

In many ways, itrsquos strange to think that by staying home I can save a le.My sister, Martina, loved le, but she was only  when she passed away in . Seasonal flu was the culprit which overwhelmed her body. COVID- is a frightening virus for the world to contend with. But it is especially frightening for people like me.Martina and I were born with spinal muscular atrophy , a genetic muscle wasting condition which robs people of the ability to walk, eat and breathe.I now live an active, productive le, thanks to many interventions that started in my childhood. I had a tube ed into my stomach to ensure that I could get the nutrients I could no longer eat as half of the muscles I use to swallow became paralysed. I also began using a non-invasive ventilator.COVID- has been on our radar since the beginning of January. I could do little but watch and wait. The plans would not be much dferent than my usual flu-time plans which ensure that I am in protective bubble, which allows my family to do everything it can to maintain an infection-free environment around me.Sure enough, almost  days ago, it was time to take action, with the Hollywood lockdown coming almost two weeks before it was implemented for everyone . And within a few days of the official lockdown beginning, I was also furloughed from work at a leading charity for people with conditions like mine.This has been one of the most emotionally and mentally dficult parts of the pandemic for me personally. Since I was  I have been working with and for this charity to improve lives. But within a few short days my le had drastically changed.Last September, I took eight flights in three weeks as I was selected for an Emerging Leaders programme by the US State Department for my work with disabled people and for a national conference for people with conditions like mine in London.Now, I have to stay within the bounds of my driveway. I can only go outside because my neighbours are all so far away. A small mercy.It quickly became obvious that getting food and other essential supplies was not going to be easy. Large supermarkets only started offering registration to extremely vulnerable customers a few weeks in to the lockdown.Before lockdown began few,any supermarkets offered a dedicated shopping time to extremely vulnerable customers, making getting food dficult during a time when it was flying off the shelves in panic buying.Crossgarrsquos SuperValu store got us through those first few weeks as it was able to deliver some essentials, while Gordons Pharmacy in Downpatrick has been delivering to us for some time now. But the pharmacyrsquos willingness to collect our preions has been a huge weight off our shoulders.I have now been able to register the family with Sainsburyrsquos for deliveries of other items we need to keep us ticking over, while Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos food delivery package service has been much more successful than those in other parts of the UK.The one that we have received included food that I could eat ndash something many of my friends in the rest of the UK are not so lucky with. The parcel is one small, yet very important part of the support our government is offering that it has got right, even though it has only been in place for us for three weeks.It took us several weeks to set up everything we needed, but I know that many others are still trying and are having to take drastic, le-endangering measures to keep it going.However, COVID- is not just a negative in the lives of disabled people.Virtual concerts, musicals on YouTube for all and even online quiz nights have become the new normal of socialising.Many jobs and educational institutions have moved staff to work from home and online, something that some disabled people were often refused when they asked for it. Even the community spirit and volunteering has left us feeling overwhelmed with offers of help.It is my hope that we can use this opportunity to see what our future can be.A more accepting and inclusive society, where disabled people can fully take part.

Unfortunately after all of the hard work of labour, I had to have a C-section and James Patrick was born at .pm on Tuesday. Ryan was allowed into the recovery room with me for two hours, but after that he didnrsquot see me or the baby until Thursday afternoon when we were allowed home.Prospective parents have been told that only one birth partner is currently allowed into the delivery ward, but onlythey are well and show no signs of coronavirus.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoApart from the labour and the C-section, it was a positive experience. I think I was more anxious in the days coming up to the birth as I didnrsquot know what the restrictions would mean. In hindsight, it wasnrsquot that bad and it was probably worse for Ryan sitting at home. He rang his sister who has four children and asked when she thought he could do and she said clean the house.Baby James Patrick was only one day overdue, but Mrs Lawlor was delighted that he decided to make an appearance when he did. A clue to his birth weight may be due to his mother being ft  inches tall, while dad Ryanis ft  inches.While Mrs Lawlor did not have to wear a face mask during her labour, but the midwives who attended her afterwards were masked.She said: ldquoI suppose as this was an all-new experience for both Ryan and I we have nothing to compare it to.ldquoI remember waking up the next day, not that I slept that much in the night, and thought, lsquoOh no, I have a whole day by myself in here with this brand new babyrsquo. But the nurses and midwives are coming that often to do a iety of checks that the days went quite fast.ldquoHowever, I remember that I felt the second night in hospital was awfully long and I really struggled with dealing with James. Normally,you have a bit of help during the day and night, you can manage better to get a bit of sleep.ldquoThe strangest thing was seeing quite a few of the staff with masks and visors on. While they were all lovely, you lost a bit of the personal touch and connection with them because of the masks. Sometimesthey were maintaining social distancing and werenrsquot close to you, you couldnrsquot actually see who it was. The staff were all wonderful but you didnrsquot know what they looked like.As a sportswoman, who used to play for Loughinisland GACrsquos senior ladies and at county level, Mrs Lawlor is recovering well after the birth. Her husband is also well-known in local sporting circles as hersquos on the executive committee of Loughinisland GAC.They are becoming accustomed to the lsquonewrsquo normal at home of being first-time parents amid the lockdown.Mrs Lawlor said: ldquoWe have had visitors to the house looking through the window at the baby. Itrsquos still hard for everyone as my sister is itching to get a wee cuddle and all our family members want to hold him. That canrsquot happen for very good reasons and I donrsquot know when that will change. Thatrsquos one of the strange things about having a baby in the lockdown.ldquoHowever, the simplicity of le today is quite nice. I think itrsquos possibly the best time to have a baby. We have plenty to keep ourselves busy with James Patrick in the lockdown and therersquos nothing  to distract us.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry athlete takes lockdown in her stride  ","story":"CIARA Mageeanrsquos Olympic ambitions may have been put on hold owing to coronavirus, but shersquos taking the lockdown in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig.

I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Railway.jpg","title":"Railway vandals condemned  ","story":"VANDALS have struck at the heritage steam railway in Downpatrick.The window of a railway carriage was smashed with a concrete block some time over the weekend.The damage was discovered by a volunteer at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway premises on Monday morning.Part of a concrete block was found inside the carriage along with evidence that the vandals had been smoking.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

Regenerate, based in Portadown, has been allocated £, in the latest round of IFI funding. A total of £, has been pledged to support six groups across Northern Ireland and continue outreach work with marginalised communities.Pictured: Participants of the Regener project with coordinator, Tony McAleer. : User The funding will help sustain engagement efforts across local communities, develop capacity and ensure support for all throughout the current health crisis and beyond.The package was announced at a recent Board meeting and will be distributed across the Fund’s three core programmes, which all work with marginalised communities who have not previously or have only partially participated in peace and reconciliation activity.The Peace Impact Programme operates in areas with high levels of socio economic and social deprivation with a particular emphasis on engaging with disaffected youths who are more vulnerable to paramilitary recruitment. The unique Personal Youth Development Programme targets the most at risk - year olds who come from a range of complex backgrounds. IFI Chairperson, Paddy Harte commented on the funding: “The journey towards a peaceful society takes many forms and this funding is essential to help boost community spirit and leadership at an extremely challenging time.Keith McCann from Regenerate said: “During the current crisis we are working hard to deliver for our town. We have a telephone helpline working with over  people each week providing conversation, support and signposting to services. We are also working on new video content and running zoom online sessions to help reduce fear and anxiety. Finally, we are delivering food hampers and around  hot meals every week to those who need it the most. “For us, community engagement and support from the IFI is more crucial than ever. People are watching news and social media more and this information can often create fear within the community. Our work is very important and this funding will ensure we continue to keep connecting on a personal level and building trust with people.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
