Above Meghan is pictured during her first Christmas with the royals in 2017           Sandringham House, in Norfolk, is where the royals have been enjoying the Yuletide every year since 1988. The royal Christmas dinner traditions e young princes and princesses eating away from the adults and being cared for by nannies, a tradition which means Markle\u0027s newborn will be in a separate room from her next year.In an essay on her humanitarian work, Markle once wrote: \u0027My parents came from little so they made a choice to give a lot: buying turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving, delivering meals to people in hospices, giving spare change to those asking for it.\u0027It\u0027s what I grew up seeing, so it\u0027s what I grew up being: a young adult with a social consciousness to do what I could and speak up when I knew something was wrong.\u0027What a difference from the opulent surroundings of Sandringham House, in Norfolk, where the royals have been enjoying the Yuletide every year since 1988.When the Queen and her relatives open presents on Christmas Eve, Markle, 37, will be able to tell her new family the story behind one of her father\u0027s first gifts, which made her proud of growing up in a mixed race household - Thomas is white, Doria black.According to Andrew Morton\u0027s biography, Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, her father bought two sets of Heart dolls containing the traditional nuclear family unit of mother, father and two children. \u0027He bought one with black dolls, one with white, and mixed them together to represent Meghan\u0027s own family. Then he wrapped them in sparkly Christmas paper and placed the box under the tree,\u0027 Morton writes.While the duchess has been praised for her past and present charity work, it\u0027s also been noted that she has a sense of entitlement and it\u0027s not a recently acquired trait. Harry was quoted as saying: \u0027What Meghan wants, Meghan gets\u0027 - but apparently her father also doted on the duchess.          Giving back: Back when she was still in her hometown of Los Angeles, Meghan sometimes spent the holiday season delivering turkeys to homeless shelters in Skid Row, a square mile of downtown Los Angeles riddled with thousands of destitute people packed in dirty tents on the sidewalks           Skid Row is known for its high crime rate and, come nightfall, up to 10,000 homeless people - many with drug, alcohol and mental health problems - will congregate in the impoverished neighborhood          Meghan at one point even volunteered at Hippie Kitchen (pictured) a long-standing Skid Row soup kitchen, writing in her blog that she was influenced by her parents, who \u0027came from little so they made a choice to give a lot\u0027    The Duchess of Sussex was recently seen giving back to the community at the Hubb Community Kitchen in London last month (pictured)           Growing up as the favorite of a doting dad, Christmases were pretty much the same for Meghan, she would demand what she wanted and pretty much always get it, much to the annoyance of her half-siblings, Thomas Jr and Samantha, according to a biography on the royal While studying at Northwestern University in Chicago, if she didn\u0027t go back home to Los Angeles for Christmas, Meghan would stay on campus and hang out at her women\u0027s sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, where she handily lived next-door at the North Mid-Quad halls of residence.Markle credits the nearby 24-hour Burger King for keeping her going during these times, as well as, the Mexican-food chain Chipotle, just across the road. She had said in a blog post years ago that \u0027little girls dream of being princesses\u0027, but they must have been almost impossible to envisage as she was tucking into burgers and fries, sitting on hard plastic chairs under the stark bright lights.After landing the part of Rachel Zane in Suits, she started dating film producer and first husband Trevor Engelson, and would spend her weeks commuting between Los Angeles and filming in Toronto.Special events like Christmas and Thanksgiving would be split between her new beau and the cast, who would party together in Toronto with \u0027Meghan bringing her Vitamix super-blender to whip up soups and cocktails for the group,\u0027 according to Morton.

I want to devote myself to the happiness of the people so I will make an effort to that end.\u0027Referencing her illness, Masako said: \u0027I am delighted at the fact that I can perform more duties than before as I have tried to improve my physical condition.\u0027          Masako was born the daughter of a diplomat and was schooled at Harvard and Oxford, before starting a career as a diplomat herselfBut her doctors warned in a separate statement that it is important for the crown princess to continue treatment as she remains vulnerable to fatigue, especially after a large ceremony or successive duties.She has made few public appearances since 2003. Masako was born in Japan in 1963 as the eldest daughter of a diplomat father, and spent much of her early life living abroad - first in Russia, then America.She studied at Harvard before returning to Japan, where she met her future husband at a diplomatic event in 1986.Masako soon left the country again, going to England to study for her masters at Oxford, but never finished her thesis and returned to her country of birth in 1990.Despite her time living abroad, Naruhito kept up his interest in her, and she was twice forced to turn down his marriage proposals to pursue her career.But she eventually relented after he said becoming a princess would allow her to stay involved in diplomacy, and accepted the third proposal on her birthday in 1992.           She rejected two proposals from Prince Naruhito before eventually accepting his third offer on her birthday in 1992 when he persuaded her that becoming a princess was another form of diplomacy (pictured meeting Jordan\u0027s King Abdullah in 2018)          Emperor Akihito (far left) will become the first Japanese ruler to abdicate in 200 years when he hands the throne over to Prince Naruhito (second right) on May 1 next yearThe pair married the following year.

Emperor Akihito (second row down, far left) will abdicate on April 30 next year before Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako assume the throne the following dayHe added: \u0027I feel deeply moved that the decision was made by the Imperial Household Agency making a major step toward an imperial succession.\u0027The last Japanese emperor to step down was Kokaku, who did so in favour of his son Ninko in 1817.Akihito\u0027s desire to leave the throne has revived a debate about the country\u0027s 2,000-year-old monarchy, one of the world\u0027s oldest, and has fuelled discussion about improving the status of female members of the shrinking royal population.The current male-only succession rules prohibit women from succeeding to the throne and female members lose their royal status when they marry a commoner.It means that, as it stands, Naruhito\u0027s only child Princess Aiko will not be able to inherit the throne after her father.Instead, Naruhito\u0027s younger brother Prince Fumihito will become crown prince following Akihito\u0027s abdication with his son, Prince Hisahito then in line to succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN hired Mr President hire reputation tarnished","story":"    Dear Mr President, I wish to formally apply to be your new Chief of Staff. The key thing is to have someone at your side that understands you, has known you a long time, likes you and commands your respect - and you know I\u0027m vicious, tough and brilliant - as you yourself saidWhen you made me your first Celebrity Apprentice a decade ago, you told me in the live NBC finale: ‘Piers, you’re a vicious guy. I’ve seen it. You’re tough. You’re smart. You’re probably brilliant, I’m not sure. You’re certainly not diplomatic. But you did an amazing job and you beat the hell out of everybody - you’re my Celebrity Apprentice.’Let’s be honest, what more could you possibly want from your Chief of Staff? You could have been talking about yourself!Let’s also be honest about something else: nobody else is exactly storming the ramparts of the White House demanding you hire them for the toughest job in world politics.Yesterday, it was reported that your first choice, the vice president’s CoS Nick Ayers, turned down the job despite it being an obvious step up.  You need someone who will staff the Oval Office with loyal workers, not reptiles like Omarosa Manigault. And I get on with Ivanka and Jared, and would encourage you to listen to them as much as possible.  I see them as a great asset and two very smart young people5) You need a CoS who gets on with Ivanka and Jared, and encourages you to listen to them as much as possible. I do, because I see them as a great asset to you, not a hindrance. They’re two very smart young people with independent minds who you know you can trust and who aren’t afraid to give you their honest opinions even if they know you don’t want to hear them. These are the best kind of advisors.6) You need to stop your silly war with CNN. I know some of my former colleagues have become annoyingly (and in my view, unfairly) partisan against you, and that bashing them goes down well with your base. But it’s such a waste of time and energy, and constantly calling them ‘enemy of the people’ is downright dangerous. CNN has received bombs and death threats. This feud is not a joke now, it’s deadly serious. I know how the media works better than anyone you’ve had around you. Trust me when I tell you this is a war you no longer need to wage.7) As Obama’s former CoS, Rahm Emmanuel, said this week, you need a ‘true wartime consigliere’ like Robert Duvall’s character Tom Hagen in The Godfather. Things are about to get ferociously nasty as Robert Mueller prepares his report into all things Russia. You don’t want a CoS who’s not up for a scrap. As I think my Twitter feed suggests, I love a scrap.          Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady - and I get along very well with her8) Use Melania more. She’s become a very popular electoral asset, who has barely put a foot wrong since becoming First Lady, despite all the awful lurid scandals and gossip she’s had to endure. As you know, I get on very well with Melania, and think she’s a tough, fearless, highly impressive lady. You need a CoS who knows this and persuades you to deploy her more. I’m that guy.9) You can actually save money for the country by hiring me. I don’t need the salary and in fact, I’d literally pay to work for you. What could be a better ride than being CoS at this perilous stage of the Trump presidency?10) You need someone whose reputation won’t be remotely tarnished by working with you and who won’t mind in the slightest if you suddenly fire him. I’ve been fired from big jobs before and always found it both character-building and financially lucrative. So don’t worry about finally doing what you never did in 2008 and telling me: ‘Piers, you’re fired.’ Been there, read the book, seen the play, survived and thrived.I’m available for interview with immediate effect.Kind regardsYours sincerely,Piers"},{"url":null,"title":"Lip reader reveals Chelsea fans shouted Raheem Sterling","story":"The abuse shouted at Raheem Sterling by the three men next to Colin Wing  has been revealed by forensic lipreaders today  Mr Wing, 60, from Beckenham, (left and right) has been identified to the Daily Mail as the man hurling insults.

For the most part, people either lusted after her or wanted to be her and she has been attributed with helping to usher in the sexual revolution of the 1960s.One of the first centerfolds for Playboy Magazine, Bettie appeared on its pages in January of 1955 wearing a Santa hat, and nothing else, which has largely been credited as her \u0027big break.\u0027 But with that fame also came criticism, like becoming the target of federal anti-pornography investigators following bondage shoots with brother-sister photographer duo Irving and Paula Klaw.

They looked alike, they were close in age, had pretty much the same interests and learned how to pose together. They both wanted to be models.\u0027Ron had talked about that there was a bit of a rivalry there in terms of modeling. He said Bettie would get a bit jealous when photographers would pay more attention to Goldie on shoots. And that Goldie was jealous of Bettie’s growing popularity in the modeling world. But overall, they were very supportive of each other.\u0027Ultimately, as Bettie\u0027s star status rose, Goldie hung up her tassels in favor of a calmer life as an art teacher and mom to Brem with the husband she found while performing a strip tease in 1956.Not long after and seemingly out of nowhere, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades.

And so, you understand why someone would think, My God, if this is aging, to hell with it.\u0027          Bettie\u0027s first modeling composite from 1945 in San Francisco is pictured above          Sister Goldie is seen above in this 1951 snap. Goldie died at the age of 78 in 2004, she left behind many belongs for her son, Brem, to sort through, and when he finally did, secrets from the sisters\u0027 lives were revealedRodriguez continued: \u0027In her letters, she said things like, I’ve been so depressed I ate everything in sight, things like that. So she’s clearly stating that she was an emotional eater.\u0027At the time, Bettie\u0027s many fans wondered where she had gone, with Penthouse magazine going so far as to offer a $1,000 reward for anyone who could prove whether she was alive and provide information about her whereabouts in 1996, according to the Chicago Tribune.All the while, Bettie was fighting a battle with mental illness, set against the backdrop of a culture that wasn\u0027t very in tune with its prevalence. In the 1970s, Bettie\u0027s third and final husband Harry Lear alleged the retired performer had several violent outbursts. Lear accused Bettie of shouting about the \u0027retributions of God\u0027 while waving a .22-caliber pistol around a ministry retreat in Boca Raton, Florida in January of 1972, according to a Time Magazine article headlined as \u0027the felonious Bettie Page.\u0027Three months later in April, Lear accused Bettie of forcing him and his two children to pray before a portrait of Jesus while she held a knife.  Charged with breach of the peace, Bettie was confined in Jackson Memorial Hospital for four months.           Around 1957, Bettie fled the spotlight in favor of a life of isolation for the next three decades, which saw her battle mental illness and multiple run-ins with the law.

We take the keyword and match it against web pages and rank them based on over 200 signals,\u0027 Pichai said at the start of a long, technical answer. \u0027So it\u0027s not some little man sitting behind the curtain figuring out what we\u0027re going to show the user,\u0027 Lofgren asked. \u0027We don\u0027t manually intervene in any particular search result,\u0027 Pichai said.          InfoWars founder Alex Jones attended Tuesday\u0027s hearing he\u0027s been banned from several social media platforms for promoting conspiracy theories          GOP strategist Roger Stone watched Pichai\u0027s testimony he\u0027s also accused Google of biasRepublican Congressman Lamar Smith pushed Pichai hard on allegations of bias. \u0027Google could well elect our next president, with dire implications for our democracy,\u0027 he said. He asked if it was possible for an inidual Google employee to change what shows up in a user\u0027s search. \u0027It\u0027s not possible for an inidual employee or groups of employee to manipulate our search results. We have a robust framework,\u0027 Pichai said. \u0027I disagree. I think humans can manipulate the process. It is a human process at its base,\u0027 Smith said.And Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert used his five minutes of question time to lecture Pichai - never even asking a question.\u0027You\u0027re so surrounded by liberality, that hates conservatism, that hates our constitution,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t even recognize it.\u0027\u0027You run off conservatives, you embrace liberals,\u0027 he added.Republican Rep. Steve King also joined the lecturing. He suggested Google look at employees\u0027 social media profiles to determine their political leanings. He also told Pichai that when his granddaughter was using an iPhone, she got a result on him that he wouldn\u0027t repeat in public.\u0027The iPhone is made by a different company,\u0027 Pichai responded. Apple makes the iPhone.King then said the phone could have been an Android too, which is a Google product.Pichai responded the incident could have been a notification from another app and reassured the congressman that his team would follow up. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu also got into the bias debate. He entered his colleagues\u0027 names into Google\u0027s search engine during the hearing and noted King\u0027s top result was an article from ABC News.\u0027Let me just conclude here by stating the obvious,\u0027 Lieu said. \u0027If you want positive search results, do positive things. If you don\u0027t want negative search results, don\u0027t do negative things.\u0027He added: \u0027And to some of my colleagues across the aisle, if you\u0027re getting bad press articles and bad search results, don\u0027t blame Google or Facebook or Twitter, consider blaming yourself.\u0027 ELECTION INTERFERENCE The hearing was dominated by questions of data collection, privacy, and allegations of bias against the search giant. There was less talk about anti-trust issues and regulations with a few queries on Google\u0027s actions in the wake of the 2016 election after it was revealed Russian nationals used online platforms to influence the election. Pichai emphasized repeatedly that Google found \u0027limited activity\u0027 on behalf of Russians. He said there were only two advertising accounts the company found tied to Russian, which spent a total of $4,700.He told the lawmakers \u0027you have my promise\u0027 that the company is doing all it can to protect the integrity of U.S. elections. DATA COLLECTIONPRIVACYThe first questions put to Pichai were on Google\u0027s data collection and protection of users\u0027 privacy.Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the chairman of the committee, asked the tech CEO whether the average user understands the volume of data Google collects on them. \u0027We go to great lengths\u0027 to protect users\u0027s data, Pichai reassured lawmakers.\u0027We remind users to do a privacy checkup. We make it very obvious,\u0027 he added. Republican Rep. Ted Poe held up his iPhone and asked Pichai if Google could track him if he moved across the hearing room to sit with the Democrats. \u0027Not by default but there may be a Google service you opted in to,\u0027 Pichai replied. He added he needed to know more info about the phone\u0027s settings: \u0027I genuinely don\u0027t know without looking.\u0027  SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS IN THE COMPANYPichai was asked about sexual harassment allegations made against the company. Last month, more than 20,000 Google employees around the world walked out in protest of the company\u0027s handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims.Earlier this year, Google ended its use of forced arbitration in sexual harassment cases. Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked if Pichai will commit to ending forced arbitration beyond sexual harassment. \u0027We are definitely reviewing what more we can do in this area,\u0027 he said. GOOGLE PLANS FOR CHINA The company\u0027s plans for China, where its search engine is currently banned, was another topic that came up repeatedly amid reports Google would launch a Chinese search engine that would comply with the country\u0027s strict censorship regulations.Critics are worried that the Google project, code-named Dragonfly, will enable the Chinese government to block its citizens from accessing information it doesn\u0027t like and surveil its political opponents. Pichai was asked if a prototype was built for a search engine in China but was vague in his response: \u0027We have explored what search could look like in a country like China.\u0027At one point \u0027we had over a hundred people working on it,\u0027 he said.Pichai revealed Google has no current plans to expand to China.\u0027Right now, we have no plans to launch in China. We don\u0027t have a search product there,\u0027 he said.But he did argue that access to information is a human right and pledged the company would be \u0027fully transparent\u0027 if they do proceed with plans to open a search engine there. He was vague when asked about future plans. Democratic Rep. David Cicilline asked him flat-out: \u0027Will you, Mr. Pichai, rule out launching a tool for surveillance and censorship in China while you are CEO of Google?\u0027\u0027I commit to engaging,\u0027 Pichia said. \u0027One of the things that\u0027s important to us as a company, we have a stated mission of providing users with information, and so we always think it\u0027s in our duty to explore possibilities to give users access to information. I have a commitment, but as I\u0027ve said earlier on this we\u0027ll be very thoughtful and we\u0027ll engage wide as we make progress.\u0027          Rep. Ted Poe held up his iphone and asked if Google could track him if moved across the roomLAWMAKERS GET PERSONAL Other lawmakers had more personal questions - and suggestions - for Pichai.Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen said he used Google\u0027s search engine often and asked Pichai if the company should have an \u0027online school people could go to, with a Google representative, and you can log in and ask questions, and not like Comcast where you get put on hold for 30 minutes.\u0027 He suggested the company have a representative for people to talk to \u0027say, how do I do this?\u0027He also revealed he googles himself and isn\u0027t happy with the search results. He appeared to be mocking conservative critics who claim bias in search results.Cohen complained he had the opposite problem. \u0027This weekend I was on MSNBC four times and the first thing that comes up is the Daily Caller,\u0027 he told Pichai, adding that Breitbart News also came up several times.\u0027It\u0027s hard for me to fathom being on 8 minutes ... and there\u0027s more content on Breitbart News,\u0027 he added.Pichai promised to follow up.  Tuesday\u0027s appearance was Pichai\u0027s first time testifying before Congress. He was sworn in - as all witnesses are - and was careful in his response. He made many promises to lawmakers to follow up, which is a way for a witness to give a more detailed, nuanced, carefully worded answer at a later time.           A protestor was removed from the hearing          Ian Madrigal, dressed as the \u0027Monopoly Man,\u0027 watches Google CEO Sundar Pichai testify           Pichai faced questions data collection, privacy and allegations of biasOPENING STATEMENTS Pichai sat quietly before the panel of lawmakers as members made their opening statements.His highly anticipated appearance is being closed watched by those in the tech industry and those who use the internet to push their platforms, including GOP operative Roger Stone and InfoWars founder Alex Jones - both of whom sat in the audience for Pichai\u0027s testimony.  \u0027Google is one of the most valuable companies in America because of what it does,\u0027 said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in his opening remarks, adding  that power \u0027comes with responsibility.\u0027McCarthy warned of a \u0027widening mistrust\u0027 between tech companies and American people. He said that could be alleviated by transparency and answers.He warned the panel wants to know that any political bias among Google employees does not show up in its products. McCarthy, who has been a fierce critic of the technology company, said a question before them was whether American technology companies are surveying as instruments of freedom or fo control.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai is greeted by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy at the hearing          Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who started at the company as an engineer, at times got technical in his answers\u0027A free world depends on a free internet,\u0027 he said, \u0027and we need to know Google is on the side of the free world.\u0027Democrat Rep. Jerry Nadler, the ranking member on the committee, warned against focusing on \u0027right wing conspiracy theories\u0027 during Monday\u0027s questioning.He said it was a \u0027fantasy\u0027 that there was political bias in its search results, a charge President Donald Trump has made against the internet giant.\u0027No credible evidence supports this right wing conspiracy theory,\u0027 Nadler said.He urged the committee to focus on whether outside activists were using Google to spread false information to undermine American democracy.Pichai, in his opening testimony, said the internet giant steers clear of \u0027political bias,\u0027 arguing that this is a core principle of its business to maintain trust of users.Pichai also said privacy and security are essential parts of Google\u0027s mission, and that the company is committed to working with the U.S. government \u0027to keep our country safe and secure.\u0027Pichai strongly denied claims made by by PresidentTrump and his backers earlier this year that Google operates with a political agenda that suppresses conservative voices.\u0027Users also look to us to provide accurate, trusted information,\u0027 he said. \u0027We work hard to ensure the integrity of our products, and we\u0027ve put a number of checks and balances in place to ensure they continue to live up to our standards.\u0027Pichai said Google strives to offer \u0027platforms for erse perspectives and opinions\u0027 without promoting its own agenda.\u0027I lead this company without political bias and work to ensure that our products continue to operate that way. To do otherwise would go against our core principles and our business interests,\u0027 he said.Pichai said that Google - which on Monday speeded up the shutdown of its Google+ social network after a second data security bug was discovered - supports federal privacy legislation, without offering specifics.          Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified before Congress for the first time Tuesday          Both Democrats and Republicans on the committee promised tough questions at Tuesday\u0027s hearing,\u0027Protecting the privacy and security of our users has long been an essential part of our mission,\u0027 he said.The tech CEO also sought to allay concerns that Google was snubbing American values by its decision this year to drop out of the bidding for a major Pentagon cloud computing project.\u0027Even as we expand into new markets we never forget our American roots,\u0027 he said.\u0027It\u0027s no coincidence that a company dedicated to the free flow of information was founded right here in the US. As an American company, we cherish the values and freedoms that have allowed us to grow and serve so many users.\u0027The appearance  tested Pichai\u0027s ability to be the public face of the search engine giant.\u0027It remains to be seen whether he can step up and be the kind of diplomat and statesman Google requires him to be,\u0027 Arun Sundararajan, a business professor at New York University, told The Wall Street Journal.  \u0027He has, for most of his career, been a product guy.\u0027 But he has slowly made in-road into the political world. Pichai was the White House on Thursday for a meeting between White House officials and tech execs, including representatives from Microsoft, Oracle, IBM and Qualcomm.President Donald Trump stopped by but it was Ivanka Trump who took the lead. Firebrand Republican congressman says he DOES want to be...Fired FBI chief James Comey says Trump could be \u0027in serious...Trump defends hush money payments to alleged mistresses as...Share this articleThe use of artificial intelligence was the main item on the agenda. Pichai is dipping his toe in the political well in the wake of waves caused by his predecessor Eric Schmidt, who had powerful political allies in both parties and counted former President Barack Obama as a friend. Google had some of its political peaks in the Obama years when it beat an antitrust probe  and secured favorable policies on net neutrality, online liability and copyright issues. But the political winds have shifted since then for online companies.Lawmakers are examining the need for stronger federal protections governing the collection of online data and some Republicans complain there is a suppression of conservative speech. President Trump has tweeted his complaints about the company, charging Google\u0027s search results are rigged.             Pichai\u0027s predecessor Eric Schmidt was close with President Barack Obama          Lawmakers left an empty chair in September when Google skipped a Senate Intelligence Committee hearingPichai has kept a  low profile since becoming Google\u0027s chief in 2015. A native of Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company, starting as an engineer. He has already made overtures to Washington after the company angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in September, when it failed to send top leaders to appear at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing along Facebook\u0027s Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter\u0027s Jack Dorsey. Lawmakers left an empty chair at the witness table to symbolize Google\u0027s absence. Pichai flew to Washington D.C. later in September for inidual meetings with lawmakers - and agreed to Tuesday\u0027s committee hearing.Google CEO Faces Hot Seat in Washington - WSJGoogle\u0027s turn for the Facebook treatment - AxiosGoogle Hearing to Preview Democrats’ Strategy on Big Tech - The New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Chelsea fan previously defended yob supporters Paris Metro","story":"Share this articleChelsea fan who abused Raheem Sterling previously backed Blues thug who kicked black man off train"},{"url":null,"title":"The iPhone different company Google CEO chides Rep Steve King","story":"    Congressman Steve King  complained about a notification his grand daughter got on her iPhone          Google chief executive Sundar Pichai told him iPhone is made by another companyHe is one of several Republican lawmakers who have alleged Google is biased against conservatives in its search results.

There was less talk about anti-trust issues and regulations with a few queries on Google\u0027s actions in the wake of the 2016 election after it was revealed Russian nationals used online platforms to influence the election. Pichai defended his company\u0027s search practices multiple times on Tuesday in the face of questions from  lawmakers on allegations of bias against conservatives.The topic came up repeatedly in the three and half the tech executive sat before lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee.\u0027Our algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,\u0027 Pichai said in defense of Google\u0027s search engine, which is the most used in the world.\u0027We approach our work without any political bias,\u0027 he insisted. "},{"url":null,"title":"Comedian pulls university charity event asked sign behaviour contract","story":"    Comedian Konstantin Kisin has pulled out of a student charity event organised by Unicef On Campus society at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)Student leaders said the ban was necessary to preserve the event as a \u0027safe space\u0027 and a place for \u0027joy, love, and acceptance\u0027.But Mr Kisin, 35, who was born in the Soviet Union, said the demand amounted to a \u0027threat to freedom of speech\u0027 and pulled out.The fundraising event, scheduled for January 23, is organised by the Unicef On Campus society at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), part of the University of London. More than 100,000 university and college students demand...Student, 25, slams \u0027sexist\u0027 rental firm after it advertised...Share this articleMr Kisin was one of four comedians invited to perform unpaid, with proceeds going to the UN children\u0027s charity.Politics student Fisayo Eniolorunda, the society\u0027s event organiser, wrote in the invitation: \u0027Attached is a short behavioural agreement form that we will ask for you to sign on the day to avoid problems.\u0027          Mr Kisin was sent a \u0027behavioural agreement form\u0027 which stopped him telling jokes which were not \u0027respectful and kind\u0027After listing subjects covered by the no-tolerance policy, the form stated: \u0027It does not mean that these topics cannot be discussed.

This article is unbalanced and misleading. It hurts my feelings and it also hurts INTO\u0027s and Grindr\u0027s reputation,\u0027 Chen replied.   \u0027The reason I said marriage is a holy matrimony between a man and a woman is based on my own personal experience. I am a straight man married to a woman I love and I have two beautiful daughters I love from the marriage. This is how I feel about my marriage,\u0027 he explained. Chen then said he deleted the post because his 60-year-old conservative aunt got involved in the \u0027heated discussion\u0027 that transpired under the post.           In the post, Chen said: \u0027There are people who believe that marriage is a holy matrimony between a man and a woman.

I support gay marriage and I am proud that I can work for Grindr. I apologize that my words did not clearly convey these feelings,\u0027 Chen added. However, Chen\u0027s apology didn\u0027t stop Zumwalt from leaving the company.  \u0027For those who remain, those who will continue to fight for our community from within, know I will be cheering you on from the sidelines,\u0027 Zumwalt said. \u0027Persist.

They deserve better.“That means businesses, government and trade unions working together, locally and nationally, to bring high-tech industries to more places across the UK.”Manufacturing has become a smaller part of the UK economy since the 1970s, shrinking from almost a third of economic output to around a 10th, while jobs have also been lost.The TUC said however that sustainable industry and green technology could be one of the key planks in delivering new manufacturing jobs in the future, while arguing that targets could help boost the chances of the policy achieving its aims.The report said: “It could be argued that concrete commitments and accountability focus the minds of politicians in a way that arguing for manufacturing strength, in an abstract sense, does not.”Other recommendations by the TUC include a target for a third of the industrial strategy challenge fund to be directed toward investments known to be providers of quality employment, as well as a twice-yearly review into the number of roles it has helped to create.It also said local enterprise partnerships ought to work with unions to develop growth plans as part of the industrial strategy, while also demanding that unions are involved in talks to create sector deals – a key part of the industrial strategy giving government backing to particular industries.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We are getting on with delivering the modern industrial strategy with record levels of investment in R\u0026ampD, the fastest growth in infrastructure spending in the G7, the biggest shakeup to technical education in a generation and sector deals to put the UK at the forefront of the industries of the future.“The independent Industrial Strategy Council is holding the government to account by monitoring the success in delivering the industrial strategy and its impact on the economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089eeaa1cc194672c0d8f6b191991b0f18043739/6_0_1733_1041/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f82c11ef4c14c22accb80d2757cba397","title":"the guardian view on mps and brexit parliament must decide","story":"Britain’s raging argument about Brexit is increasingly morphing into a contest about more issues than just this country’s relationship with the European Union. It is also turning into a contest about the relationship between two sources of democratic power – referendums and parliament. Referendums claim to elevate the people’s will over parliament, which is expected to defer indefinitely and in detail. Yet Britain’s historic constitutional doctrine, still bred in the bone of most MPs, has traditionally been that parliament is sovereign.The Victorian jurist AV Dicey argued long ago that parliament “has the right to make or unmake any law whatever” and that “no person or body is recognised by the law … as having the right to override or set aside the legislation of parliament”. Much has changed in the laws of Britain since Dicey, including human rights legislation, devolution and Britain’s 45-year membership of what is now the EU. Nevertheless the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty that he set out remains a guiding and established principle for the courts and for all parties and MPs, whether they are remainers or leavers.However, parliament’s rights are being relentlessly stress-tested by the Brexit crisis. Several times since the 2016 referendum, parliament has asserted its sovereign right to make the final decisions on Brexit, often in the face of government opposition. Examples include the original article 50 withdrawal decision itself, the call for a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal and, only last week, the instruction to publish the attorney general’s legal advice to ministers on the withdrawal agreement. If, in the coming weeks, there is a successful attempt to pause the article 50 process, as Sir John Major advocated on Tuesday, or a vote for a second referendum, then this process will have reached an even greater climax.There was another interim clash in this process on Monday when Theresa May decided unilaterally to suspend the debate on her Brexit deal, which had been due to come to the vote on Tuesday evening. That decision was an insult to MPs, especially the 164 who had already spoken in the debate. It made a mockery of the belief that parliament, rather than government, is in charge of its own processes.When a government has a clear majority, this issue is blurred. Yet in a hung parliament, with no overall majority and both major parties split over Brexit, it is painfully obvious that MPs’ claim to control their own house is in fact still dependent on ministers for much of the time. The Speaker, John Bercow, rightly denounced Mrs May’s decision to pull the vote on Monday. He is clearly up for a long fight to defend the Commons against ministerial attempts to railroad MPs. A Labour backbencher grabbed the Commons mace in protest. On Tuesday, rather than debating the Brexit deal, MPs instead found themselves toothlessly debating why they were not debating it.This is a crucial battle, whose importance goes beyond remain versus leave. Mrs May’s decision to stop the debate must not mean that the procedural concessions that MPs have won are simply wiped from the record when – or if – Mrs May comes back from her travels with a revised version of the withdrawal deal or a new addendum to it. In the Commons on Tuesday the cabinet office minister David Lidington appeared to accept that five days of withdrawal agreement debate are paused, not aborted. It is essential that this should be so.This country needs to have the vote on the Brexit deal but it also needs a Commons that is empowered to make its own decision in time to prevent a no-deal alternative. The vote should therefore happen as soon as possible, not at the last minute. The ensuing process should be facilitated and not blocked by the party whips. Many MPs on all sides grasp this. It is vital that they, and Mr Bercow, stand firm and ensure that the Commons takes charge. Brexiters in the government and on the backbenches always claim to regard a sovereign House of Commons as a fundamental pillar of leaving the EU. They have no right to complain when MPs insist on exercising that sovereignty, or when they do so in new ways – perhaps even through a free unwhipped vote – that challenge the excessive power of ministers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/088e3bec2151a98bef13af9d5c7b5ba823a3cd88/0_282_4851_2911/master/4851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4466e10242e9f4e135720b7070d637ae","title":"myths migration stereotypes insecure low paid work","story":"Amid all the true-blue backbench blowhards and armchair pundits who will occupy the airwaves this Brexit week, one thing is guaranteed: you won’t hear a word from Robert. Why should you? He commands neither power nor status. He has hardly any money either. And yet he is crucial to this debate, because it is people like him that Brexit Britain wants to shut out.Robert is a migrant, under a prime minister who keeps trying and failing to impose an arbitrary cap on migrants to this country. Born in Timişoara, Romania, he now lives in a democracy that barely batted an eyelid when Nigel Farage said it was OK to be worried about Romanian neighbours. And Robert gets all the brickbats hurled at foreigners down the ages – that he’s only here to take your jobs and claim your benefits (at one and the same time, mystifyingly), to undercut your wages and give nothing back.The likes of Robert make the easiest human punchbags. You rarely see him or the millions of other EU citizens living in Britain on your TV. Nor do you hear about them from a political class forever chuntering on about the will of the people, yet too aloof from the people to know who they are or what they want, and too scared of them to engage in dialogue.Yet Robert (he’s asked that his surname be withheld) is no caricature. It’s not just how he dotes on his daughter and has a streak of irony thicker than the coffee he serves up. It’s also how his life in Britain proves that those declaimed causes of Brexit are both too easy and too far off the mark. However sad his story, it also shows where our economy really is broken – and how it will not be fixed by kicking out migrants.We met a few weeks ago at his flat on the outskirts of Newcastle upon Tyne. Too bare to be a home, its sole reminder of his old family life is a little girl’s bedroom, kept in unchildlike order for his daughter’s weekend visits. He and his wife split a few months ago, he says, when the family’s money ran out. What’s left now is a bank account in almost permanent overdraft and a 38-year-old man tearing himself apart over his broken life here. “I’m an idiot,” he says. “I’ve wasted myself.”But please, spare him the migrant stereotypes. Low-skilled? Robert came to the UK in 2008 with a law degree and speaking three languages. Low aspirations? Even while grafting in restaurants and hotels, he fired off over 100 applications for a solicitor’s training contract. That yielded just one interview, in Leeds. Local firms that were happy to have him volunteer for free proved more reluctant to give him a paying job. He ended up in a part of the country that has spent most of the past 40 years trying to recover from Thatcherism’s devastation, and which is even now paying the price in cuts for the havoc wreaked 10 years ago by bankers largely based hundreds of miles away. In a country where relations between regions are as lopsided as they are between workers and bosses, the odds were stacked against him from the start.Finally, Robert signed with a temp agency, PMP Recruitment, which in August 2012 placed him with the local Nestlé factory. And that’s where trouble really began.He had just enrolled in the precarious workforce, which at the last count numbered just over 3.8 million workers across the UK. Never guaranteed work, he had to wait for the offer of shifts to be texted to him a few days beforehand. He did days, nights, whatever was given, and started on the minimum wage in Nestlé’s Fawdon plant – a giant place churning out Toffee Crisps and Rolos and Fruit Pastilles. It was no Willy Wonka-land.Robert began by “spotting” – standing on a podium overlooking the Blue Riband production line and pulling out imperfect chocolate bars. Seeing the conveyor belt spool along for hours on end made him dizzy, and another recently departed worker tells me he couldn’t bear to do it for long (Nestlé says it has “rotation processes for work that is particularly repetitive”). Stubborn pride made him stick it out for 12-hour shifts. “Leave your head at home,” workmates would advise and, amid the exhaustion of shifts and raising a family, that’s what he did. But bit by bit he noticed things were wrong.As an agency worker, he says he was doing the same tasks as Nestlé staff, but for less money. They got a pay rise, he alleges, that agency workers didn’t. He would do work classed by the company as “skilled” but instead got “unskilled” rates. His former workmate, who doesn’t wish to be named, tells me this was common practice: “If Nestlé wanted you to come in at an awkward time, they’d say, ‘We can pay you skilled rates’.” Over the years, Robert estimates that he lost out on about £26,000 of income.Robert was in no man’s land. He was spending his days working for Nestlé but was not their direct employee – even though he gave five years of service at Fawdon. Nor did he have much to do with his recruiters at PMP, a nationwide agency. As for the plant’s trade unions, he saw them as “a waste of space”. He was trapped in an institutional vacuum. The chair of the Law Society’s employment law committee, Max Winthrop, describes such arrangements – working for one company while on the books of another for years on end – as a “fiction”. “The most generous way you can look at it is, it’s a confusing situation. The least generous is that it’s a deliberate attempt to throw sand in everyone’s eyes so we can’t see the true nature of the relationship.” Nestlé says that of its 600 staff at Fawdon, 100 are agency, all via PMP. Over the years, Robert says he saw hundreds of agency staff come and go.When Robert raised the issue with Nestlé managers, he alleges that shifts were no longer given to him. Finally, just before last Christmas, he resigned. He then tried to get other agency workers to join him in taking Nestlé to court, but they were, he says, “too nervous”. So he launched an employment tribunal case alone and, a few weeks after we met, Nestlé settled out of court. One of the conditions of the settlement is that he cannot discuss it, but Robert knows this article will appear. Citing confidentiality, Nestlé did not want to comment directly on his case but says that, since 2014, all staff in its factories get the living wage, and “we refute any allegation that working conditions at our Fawdon factory are below standard”.On his PMP payslips Robert also noticed that – as a result of the “recruitment travel scheme” in which the agency had enrolled him – some months he was getting less than minimum wage, a situation for which Winthrop says he “cannot find any justification”. He took PMP to court too, and a couple of months ago was awarded over £2,000 in back pay. PMP wouldn’t comment for this piece, other than to say it is appealing the verdict.The best way to defeat a crass generalisation is with specifics, and what Robert’s story tells you is it’s not the migrant worker doing the undercutting here. He even tries to get his British-born workmates to join him in a class action for what’s rightfully theirs. The real problem is instead the imbalance of power between the worker and the employer, which is happily maintained by the same politicians today who claim they want to help the “left behind”.PMP and the 18,000 or so other employment agencies in Britain are overseen by a government inspectorate of just 11 staff. The director of labour market enforcement in the UK, David Metcalf, admits that a UK employer is likely to be inspected by his team only once every 500 years. Were I an unscrupulous boss, I would take one look at those numbers and ask myself: if I do my worst, what’s the worst that can happen?What keeps Robert here now is those weekends with his daughter. But after 10 years in Britain he’s learned something else too, about the reality of a country that claims to welcome foreigners, even as they punish them. An economy that promises a better life to those it then sucks dry. A society that kids itself that it’s a soft touch when really, it is as cold and hard as any interminable overnight shift."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/629076b163453ce74bdcc17da8ad37b47dd9cd20/0_0_5017_3011/master/5017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=802c1e3940db0b74b075ac06dc872ed9","title":"the best gift for your ageing parent is the gift of your time","story":"Searching for that elusive present, we might be neglecting the one that is most obviousA colleague is scrolling distractedly through images on her phone as we wait for a meeting to start.“What do you get a mother in her 70s?” she whispers.Leaning over, I examine cardigans, scarves and purses by the dozens, holding back on commenting that they all look the same.“The problem is they all look the same,” she sighs.The meeting starts, and I never ask her what she got, but I think of her dilemma a few months later as I wonder what birthday gift to get my father.He is a man of letters, a retired Indian academic. His favourite pastimes are to read and write, especially in retirement when he sits at the dining table for hours on end, crafting deep essays and sublime poetry. I have bought him writing pads and elegant pens but there are only so many of those a writer needs and lately, knowing my penchant for pens, he has been giving them back to me to “use in the mean time”.His computer is ageing – you could comfortably make a cup of tea and drink half by the time it stirs. Recently, some hackers cunningly singled out all his Indian contacts to be notified that he had an urgent illness that required a financial bailout. Their consternation was nothing compared to my dad’s. It turned out that his backup system for five years of writing had been his brain. My husband and a shop managed to retrieve the data but my faith in his computer was forever lost.I’ll get him a laptop, I think, pleased with myself.“Let me buy you a new laptop for your birthday,” I say.He frowns. “Why? My old one is fine.”Worried that a new laptop might just upset his writing pattern, I relent.The next week, the birthday a bit closer, I offer to replace his smartphone, which could really be a great deal smarter, but he is not convinced: “My phone makes calls, sends texts and fetches mail. What more would a new one do?” I can’t say.Leaving me contemplating the infinite possibilities, my children do what they can. They bake him their favourite chocolate-chip cookies. Since they steal away some of the raw ingredients, they manage only 10 finished products, which turn out just right – large, golden and chewy. One cookie mysteriously crumbles, and they keep one each for their brilliant effort. This leaves six cookies hastily placed in a used plastic bag and placed into their grandfather’s hands. He is gratified and thrilled beyond words. For the next few days, he savours his grandchildren’s cookies bit by bit, ignoring his daughter’s protestations about sugar hits for breakfast.Which still leaves me short of a present – and now, competing with my own children!I go to work hoping to find inspiration. Every pre-Christmas clinic brings up a similar set of anxieties for a different set of people. Is it OK to have a break at Christmas? If I skip a dose, will my cancer grow faster? Can we give Dad a glass of wine at lunch? Could this be Mum’s last Christmas?I try to answer each question with honesty and consideration, regarding the disease in the context of the person. The majority of patients are reassured to hear that skipping a treatment will not jeopardise their wellbeing and in fact, a convivial family gathering may be the most therapeutic intervention of all. I witness people’s expression turn to joy at the thought of a Christmas unfettered by the toxicities of treatment – and as I sign the orders, I secretly can’t help feeling a tiny bit like a magician.But no closer to finding the perfect gift.Later that day, I meet an elderly man who has resolutely denied my interpretations of his illness, insisting that he feels fine. Worried at the fatal toxicities that chemotherapy can impose, I hope that Christmas will tempt him to take a break. But to my surprise, he wants to know why we close for a public holiday. Sensing my frustration, he reluctantly offers an explanation,“If I stop treatment, I may not see my son. He drives me to chemotherapy and takes me home – it’s our time together. It’s the nicest thing about having treatment.”Then he sits back and looks out of the window as I let his simple and devastating reason wash over me.Did he really see toxic chemotherapy as the price to pay for seeing his son? Had it taken a terminal illness for father and son to talk regularly? I don’t know for sure, but I can see that he believes it and that’s what matters.“Tell me about your son,” I say, so that my chaotic thoughts might settle.When he has finished, I realise that he has told me nothing about who his son is or what he does, only the times they have spent together that mean so much. They are mundane too – trips in the car, buying groceries, picking up a grandchild, going to the carwash.He knows everyone is busy but still, he can’t deny that his son’s company is his greatest consolation and his nicest reward. So, if that means having some extra chemotherapy, so be it. I listen to him, moved and humbled, and a little lost for words.I find myself thinking of a friend who gave his mother 60 walks for her 60th birthday. Each week’s walk was a great commitment but far more meaningful than any wrapped present. And another friend who visited her mother every single week for the years she spent in residential care, dementia chipping away at her core. In the end, there was no gift to give her save that of a familiar presence that could expect no return. It must have been a heart-wrenching gift to give, but at the same time, priceless.And it dawns on me that in searching for that elusive gift for an ageing parent, we are neglecting the one that is most obvious: the gift of our time. In an age where we live and work in far-flung corners of the world, spending time together isn’t always easy or practical but we deceive ourselves by thinking that it doesn’t matter. The antidote to an epidemic of loneliness doesn’t lie in sending a bigger gift but in exercising our imagination. If the stories of my patients are anything to go by, our imagination would tell us to show up a little more, to call a little more and to simply be more attentive. A sorrow shared is a sorrow ided. No medical advance, and no wrapped gift, could ever compete with this.I tell my patient that I will talk to his son and we will figure something out. He says thank you for not judging him. Then I stop looking for a gift for my dad and call him to say I will pick him up and we will go for a drive. I’ll be ready, he says.• Ranjana Srivastava is is an oncologist and  Australia columnist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/386751eb0d6dfa33abf2cac3cd8725992c11c0ad/42_0_997_598/master/997.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50001d71835cac3b5cf4c87cc9ac6c89","title":"comedians asked to sign behavioural agreement for soas gig","story":"Organiser apologises ‘for the misunderstanding’ after comic pulls out of fundraiserComedians invited to perform at a benefit gig at Soas University of London have been sent a “behavioural agreement” that forbids them from tackling any topic in a way that is not “respectful and kind”.Konstantin Kisin, a comedian and free speech campaigner, pulled out of next month’s event after being sent the contract. “I was genuinely shocked,” he said. “I’ve performed at students unions many times before and never been asked to sign a contract.”Kisin was among five comedians scheduled to perform at the event, which is being held to raise money for Unicef. They all received an email from Fisayo Eniolorunda, the organiser from Soas’s Unicef on Campus society. The email read: “Attached is a short behavioural agreement form that we will ask for you to sign on the day to avoid problems.”It said the contract had been written “to ensure an environment where joy, love and acceptance are reciprocated by all.” By signing it, the performers were “agreeing to our no tolerance policy with regards to racism, sexism, classism, ageism, ableism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia or anti-religion or anti-atheism.”It added: “All topics must be presented in a way that is respectful and kind. It does not mean that these topics can not be discussed. But, it must be done in a respectful and non-abusive way.”Kisin said it was vital that comedians were not prevented from exploring difficult issues on stage.“Obviously performers shouldn’t be allowed to go on stage with the intention of being racist or homophobic,” he said. “But comedians play with ideas and sometimes we stray over the line, or are perceived to have done so. It’s vital that we’re not prevented from playing with ideas in that way or forced to sign contracts that mean if that happens, we’re held up as having broken our word.”The National Union of Students said contracts of this sort were very unusual. “There is little to no evidence that students’ unions are routinely dictating what they can and can’t say,” a spokesperson said.“Some students’ unions will have policies to ensure a booking is appropriate others will not. There is more likely to be a basic ‘sense check’, as would occur in any other venue, to ensure that there isn’t an obvious mismatch between a booking and the audience they’ll be performing in front of.”Unicef on Campus societies are independent of Unicef’s national organisation. The society said in a statement: “We are a group of students who … do not represent Unicef or any student body. We extended an invitation to guests with the idea of hosting a comedy night to raise funds. Given that Unicef is a children’s charity, we wanted to make sure it was an appropriate event for the cause. We would never wish to impose that guests would have to agree to anything they do not believe in. We apologise for the misunderstanding.”Soas students’ union said it did not require external speakers to sign any form of contract before speaking at events and the Unicef on Campus society had been “overzealous” in interpreting guidelines. A spokesperson said: “The union believes fully in freedom of speech and the freedom to try to make people laugh.”Examples of student unions dictating what comedians can and cannot discuss are rare. In 2015, Goldsmiths, University of London cancelled a gig by the comedian and political activist Kate Smurthwaite after reports that campaigners were threatening to picket the event because of her views on decriminalising sex work.In 2014, the comic Dapper Laughs was banned from performing at Cardiff University after more than 700 people signed a petition complaining that his show “trivialised rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad32dd00ebea577b6221b8c2aaea26ae138eb77/73_0_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=718ef378a43702303ebcddd8764a8f97","title":"us accused of obstructing talks at un climate change summit","story":"Vanuatu’s foreign minister says worst offenders on global warming are blocking progressThe United States and other high carbon dioxide-emitting developed countries are deliberately frustrating the UN climate summit in Katowice, Poland, Vanuatu’s foreign minister has said. His warning came as Pacific and Indian ocean states warned they faced annihilation if a global climate “rule book” could not brokered.In a bruising speech before ministers and heads of state, Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, singled out the US as he excoriated major CO2-emitting developed countries for deliberately hindering negotiations.“It pains me deeply to have watched the people of the United States and other developed countries across the globe suffering the devastating impacts of climate-induced tragedies, while their professional negotiators are here at COP24 putting red lines through any mention of loss and damage in the Paris guidelines and square brackets around any possibility for truthfully and accurately reporting progress against humanity’s most existential threat,” he said.Regenvanu said the countries most responsible for climate change were now frustrating efforts to counter it.The UN’s climate change talks in Poland have been distracted by a semantic debate over whether the conference should “welcome” or “note” the IPCC’s special report warning of dire consequences if global warming rises more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with a bloc of four oil-producing countries – the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Kuwait – insisting the report be only “noted”.Documents from the conference presidency, seen by the , indicate the issue of how to acknowledge the report will be returned to later in the week and is likely to further slow progress on negotiating a final outcome. Negotiators said they are growing increasingly pessimistic that talks can be concluded by their deadline on Friday.“Whether you welcome, or note, or shamefully ignore the science altogether,” Regenvanu said, “the fact remains that this is catastrophic for humanity, and party negotiators blocking meaningful progress should have much on their conscience.”He said climate change represented an existential threat to humanity, but “we have overcome greater human-induced wrongs before like colonialism, like slavery”.As 193 countries at the climate talks seek to establish a “rule book” on how to implement the commitments made in the Paris agreement three years ago, Regenvanu condemned a two-tier system that exempted high-emissions countries from reductions obligations, saying the world needed “one common rule book, in which rules apply to all”.The US state department declined to comment on his remarks.Regenvanu was part of a cohort of small island states in the Pacific and Indian oceans that urged greater global action on limiting global warming to 1.5C leaders from Kiribati, Samoa, Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and the Males argued their countries faced an impending existential threat from climate change.Speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, the Males’ environment minister, Hussain Rasheed Hassan, said the world needed to question “why we are continuing failing?”.He said: “After a quarter of a century of UNFCCC negotiations and three years since the historic Paris agreement, we are further from approaching our goal of stabilising emissions than ever, and … rapidly approaching the point of no return.The prime minister of Kiribati, Taneti Maamau, said the countries that had contributed least to climate change were feeling its impacts first – and most acutely: “Truly, but sadly, the prosperity enjoyed by a few developed countries, has become the tragedy and misery of the mess of developing countries and particularly those most vulnerable to climate change.”Henry Puna, the prime minister of the Cook Islands, said while the Paris agreement represented a moment of global solidarity, inaction and infighting since then had paralysed efforts to reduce emissions. “I am scared for my children’s future, and for the future of generations to come,” he said. “Parties have called for action, but it is evident our current efforts are not enough.”He said climate change denialism jeopardised the future of Pacific countries: “Some are not willing to accept the stark realities.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749df71f2f36fa864ab8da4bb04bf46018e35920/0_300_6266_3760/master/6266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc6307e00703d14de7dc6b2b84f256f","title":"we could smell the boat approaching grim truth animal exports israel haifa","story":"Broken bones and other injuries are common for sheep and cattle held on ships for weeks in cramped pens. Photojournalist  Jo-Anne McArthur tracked the 22,000 arrivals on one boat in Israel’s Haifa portHundreds of thousands of live animals are transported each year on ships from Australia and Europe to the Middle East. The route from Australia to Israel is particularly long – the journey is three weeks at sea, where cattle and sheep are often kept in cramped pens for the duration.It’s estimated this year Israel will import 114,040 animals (cattle and sheep) from Australia, and 409,123 sheep and 169,991 cattle from Europe. Though these figures are lower than the previous year, in general live imports have been on the rise. Israel is expected to import 700,000 live animals this year – up from 200,000 in 2012.In July, I went to Israel to photograph the Australian ships coming into port in Haifa. One of the boats, the Bahijah, was carrying an estimated 22,000 animals.I spent a week monitoring the ships at port, waiting for news of one of the live imports. When we heard the Bahijah was coming in, we managed to rent a yacht that morning and meet the ship at sea. I was able to photograph the ship and the animals from a distance.The ship completely dwarfed us. I was struck by the smell. Even from further away we could smell the boat approaching. At almost every window you could see animals crowded together. The ones at the windows are lucky because they’re getting fresh air.The movement from the sea is really unsteady, and the animals are not used to that: in some cases they suffer injuries and broken bones. In April, a whistleblower employed on a live export ship worked with Animals Australia to reveal the situation on board a vessel. Footage from five shipments from Australia to the Middle East appeared to show sheep covered in faeces and severely decomposed bodies left in pens with living sheep. In one particular journey, more than 880 animals died during the course of the voyage.The story doesn’t end when the ships arrive at port.From here, the animals are unloaded on to trucks. This can take up to 12 and even 16 hours because there are thousands of animals on board.The cattle and sheep are then transported cross-country. I trailed trucks for hours to feedlots near Eilat, and to quarantine in a settlement in the West Bank. The feedlots were dusty and crowded. The animals in quarantine were lethargic.Dead farm animals are routinely washing up on Tel Avivian public beaches. Due to the distressing conditions animals are in, many don’t survive the journey at sea and it’s believed their corpses are just thrown overboard. The washed-up animals often have the ears or heads missing, so their ear tags can’t be traced to identify the ships.The dead and dying in feedlots are also often disposed in the desert. I witnessed football field-sized parcels of land with mounds of manure and decomposing animal bodies that must have been there for decades. The images can’t convey the stench, or the flies. The future of the controversial live imports trade is uncertain. A bill has been proposed in the Israeli Knesset to phase out live imports of animals from Australia and Europe for slaughter because of the suffering it causes the animals. The bill would reduce the transportation of live animals while increasing tax-free imports of fresh meat, and encourage local production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/245f1c846b292b6dcf1de023db4d19e0e74104fd/0_3553_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8cc49cfbe8fe6540b14e002668d06d8","title":"christmas party recipe nigel slater rachel roddy partridge pie panelle scratchings","story":"From crowd-pleasing snacks of posh crackling and chickpea fritters to Nigel Slater’s partridge pie, here is our second selection of the best recipes to celebrate ChristmasServes 12apples 500g, Cox or Braeburn preferred, peeledmincemeat 500gFor the pastrygood plain flour 250g, siftedunsalted butter 130gcaster sugar 15gice-cold water 3 tbspegg yolk 1For the frangipaneunsalted butter 50ggolden caster sugar 25gwhole peeled almonds 50g, ground quite fineegg 1 mediumFor the meringueegg whites 4 largecaster sugar 250gTo make the pastry, work the flour and butter together until a fine crumb forms.

Pile half the sausage and herb stuffing on top of the pastry, leaving 2cm or so of bare pastry around the edge. Smooth the surface level and place the 6 partridge breasts on top then add the remaining mixture, smoothing the top into a dome.Roll out the second piece of puff pastry to fit plentifully over the meat. Beat the eggs in a small bowl then brush the edge of the bottom layer of pastry generously. Lower the second piece over the top then trim any overhanging pastry with a knife. Press firmly and pinch the edges to seal. Brush with beaten egg.Use pastry trimmings to make leaves or holly berries with which to decorate your pie then press them into place. Brush with more beaten egg and rest the pie in the fridge for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6, placing a baking sheet in the oven to get hot. Carefully put the chilled pie, on its tart-tin base, on top of the hot baking sheet and bake for about 50 minutes till golden. Let the pie rest for 10 minutes before serving.While the pie bakes, prepare the sauce. Cut the clementine in half and squeeze the juice into a saucepan. Remove and discard the flesh then cut the peel into very fine strips, as thin as you can. Add these to the juice, then stir in the cranberries, marsala and jelly. Bring to the boil, immediately lower the heat then serve with the rested pie.Nigel Slater is the Observer’s food writerI love the combination of hot charred bread and aniseed butter with the rich, smoky, whipped cod roe.

Tottenham had been in and out and then they were back in again when the substitute Lucas Moura connected with Harry Kane’s cross to snatch the equaliser. Spurs had pressed hard on the front foot throughout an excellent second-half performance and the goal was no more than they deserved.But when the full-time whistle sounded, they had to wait. Their Champions League progress depended on them matching Internazionale’s result against PSV Eindhoven in Milan and the score there was 1-1. A late Inter winner would have dumped them out. The seconds ticked like hours. Then, up in the Camp Nou gods, the cheering started.It came from the travelling Spurs supporters, who had the confirmation. Inter had managed only to draw. Tottenham are through to the last 16 and they can now look forward to Monday’s draw.It had been labelled Mission Impossible after Spurs took only one point from their opening three Group B ties. But the last-gasp Wembley wins over PSV and Inter gave them hope and here they refused to believe that qualification was not a part of their destiny.A little after full time, Mauricio Pochettino was on the pitch, waving up at the Tottenham fans. He wanted to drink in the moment. It was impossibly special – one of the highlights of his four and a half years at the club. To him, the possibilities feel endless. He and his players are determined to go one step further, at least, than last season, when they lost to Juventus in the last 16.It was an evening of the finest margins. Philippe Coutinho hit the post twice for Barcelona – the first on 44 minutes the second just before Lucas’s equaliser – and Spurs suffered from a kind of helplessness, knowing that if they were not going to win, they would be vulnerable if Inter did.Inter trailed early on and, at that point, the result here was redundant. Spurs had one foot in the knockout rounds. But when Inter equalised on 73 minutes, Pochettino’s team stared at the exit. They needed something and, after seeing Jasper Cillessen keep out his close-range header, Lucas provided it.Spurs had trailed since the seventh minute to Ousmane Dembélé’s goal, which was a personal disaster for Kyle Walker-Peters, on his full Champions League debut, and, in the end, they had to rely upon a result from elsewhere that had previously felt unimaginable.They also played against what was in effect a Barcelona B team. Lionel Messi was used only as a 63rd minute substitute, as Ernesto Valverde made sweeping changes his team already assured of qualification. Yet there was an epic quality to Spurs’s resilience, their drive. They could legitimately claim to have dominated Barcelona here in the second half. The celebrations went on long into the night.The tone of the evening had been shaped by the Barcelona teamsheet. The predictions had been for changes but not to this extent. The Spanish press expected to see Messi in the starting XI and when he was named on the bench, Tottenham’s hopes had surged. Pochettino was actually laughing in his pre-match TV interview.Valverde also lined up without Marc-André ter Stegen, Gerard Piqué, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, Arturo Vidal and Luis Suárez. But, as Pochettino pointed out, they were still Barcelona a team loaded with quality.Pochettino’s boldest selection had been that of Walker-Peters, the 21-year-old right-back, his hand having been forced by the injuries to Kieran Trippier and Serge Aurier. Poor Walker-Peters. It was horrible to see how he disintegrated for the early concession how he took a heavy touch just inside the Barcelona half, after a Spurs free-kick had been cleared and the ball headed back to him by Moussa Sissoko how he was robbed by Dembélé and then brutally exposed by the forward’s searing pace.The covering Harry Winks threw himself into an all-or-nothing block only for Dembélé to step inside him and shoot past Hugo Lloris. Dembélé’s running style is so smooth that he appears to float over the turf. Walker-Peters, by contrast, was tied in knots. He would be booked shortly afterwards for a pull on Juan Miranda. His chin was on the floor.Spurs stabilised, although they struggled for their usual intensity before the interval. Pochettino put it down to playing “in both stadiums – in Camp Nou and San Siro”. Son Heung-min could not apply a touch to a low Danny Rose cross while he ran through a Thomas Vermaelen slide challenge but could not beat Cillessen when one-on-one.Spurs found gaps in Barcelona’s unfamiliar back four in the second half and they created chances. Christian Eriksen drew a flying save out of Cillessen, Kane shot wildly after outstripping Clement Lenglet and Son also worked the goalkeeper. Pochettino swapped Walker-Peters, who did block bravely from Coutinho on 54 minutes, with Érik Lamela and he switched Sissoko to right-back. The scene was set for the finale. Rose would fluff a late chance to win it, to ease Tottenham’s nerves, but this is not a team that does things the easy way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca3c4d06fcfa8d9031fdb75ca1b35cd79a6cf84f/7_97_2483_1490/master/2483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91eaed6aa9aa1a0b16f4bc24c7a7cc24","title":"liverpoolo napoli champions league match report","story":"Perhaps it would be stretching the truth to say this victory will be cherished among the great European nights here. That, however, is only because the list is already so extensive and the jubilation at the final whistle signalled how much it meant to Jürgen Klopp, his players and a hugely appreciative crowd. Liverpool had made it through and the Premier League leaders can be greatly encouraged by the way they handled a potentially treacherous night.They did, briefly, torture their crowd with the prospect of a dramatic late twist when Arkadiusz Milik, one of Napoli’s substitutes, suddenly found the ball at his feet inside the six-yard box, two minutes into stoppage time.For a split second, it was a shudder of apprehension reverberating through the stadium. Alisson, the Liverpool goalkeeper, was off his line, spreading his body, limbs pointing north, west, south and east, and the shot was blocked. “The save of the season,” Klopp called it. “I have no clue how he made that save.” In truth, Milik aimed his shot straight at the goalkeeper. But for the players in red, that save was celebrated almost like a goal.That apart, it was difficult to recall too many other occasions when Napoli threatened to score the goal that could have eliminated their opponents.José Callejón had one chance at the far post after a rare lapse from Andy Robertson and early in the game Marek Hamsik sent a 20-yard effort just over the crossbar. That, however, turned out to be a deception if it left the impression Liverpool were in for a torrid evening and, if anything, it was a surprise they did not add more goals to the one Mohamed Salah scored in the first half.Sadio Mané had a wasteful game, missing three golden opportunities and denied by an offside flag when he did put the ball in the net. Mané’s carelessness might have been costly in difficult circumstances. Here, it was only a footnote with Salah reinforcing the growing belief that he had shaken off whatever was holding him back a few months ago. On this form, it cannot be long before Liverpool’s outstanding player starts smiling again in his goal celebrations.The only downside for Liverpool was a first-half booking for Virgil van Dijk because of his follow-through, studs-up, in a challenge on Dries Mertens. Van Dijk’s yellow card means he will be suspended from the first leg of their last-16 tie. Otherwise, last season’s finalists can reflect on a hugely satisfying night’s work, especially when it began with the knowledge that even a score of 2-1, for example, could put them out of the competition. Instead, it is Napoli, currently second in Serie A, who drop into the Europa League.For both sides, the risk factor was high and the bulletins from the Rajko Mitic stadium, where Paris Saint-Germain’s 4-1 victory against Red Star Belgrade meant the French champions topped the group, added to the drama.Yet there is a reasonable theory that is how Anfield likes it best: under the floodlights, with the volume turned up and a kaleidoscope of banners on the Kop recalling the club’s pedigree in Europe. For Liverpool, it was an examination of their temperament, as much as their skill, and they passed with distinction.The game’s decisive moment arrived in the 34th minute and though Salah has scored more spectacular goals it was still a wonderful demonstration of his wit and creativity in tight areas, his ability to conjure up goals out of almost nothing and his love for the big occasion. His body strength, too, judging by the way he held off Mário Rui, the Napoli left-back, when the ball initially reached him to the right of the penalty area.Suddenly, Salah was picking up pace, gliding away from the next opponent, Kalidou Koulibaly, into a position where he could take aim. As he continued this diagonal run, it was his sideways look that fooled David Ospina into thinking a cross was coming, rather than a shot. The scam was brilliant and as the former Arsenal goalkeeper moved off his line the ball was directed through the gap in his legs. It was the eighth time this season Salah had opened the scoring for his team.It was not long before the television cameras picked out one of the Italian supporters in tears but, at that stage, there was still two-thirds of the game to play and it was reasonable to think Carlo Ancelotti’s team would commit more players into attack, knowing it was imperative they found a goal for themselves.An equaliser would have meant Liverpool needing to score twice more. It was strange, therefore, that Napoli did not react more urgently to this do or die scenario. With so much at stake, they seemed surprisingly passive, careless with the ball and struggled to create any real momentum.The question for Liverpool was whether they could shut out their opponents and 14 clean sheets from their previous 18 home games suggested they could.Equally, we should know enough about Klopp’s ethos by now to realise his players would keep looking for more goals. They could not find one and Mané will not wish to see the replays of his penalty-box misses. Ultimately, however, Alisson’s late heroics ensured that did not matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9dbdf29d2977e535cba42c12d87f0dd71817b99a/6_107_2916_1749/master/2916.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bf7ca01422ca5cee550e0f667f583c7","title":"mo salah liverpools cartoon kangaroo ready to bounce through winter","story":"The Egyptian just keeps on keeping on, and does so with a rare lightness. Against Napoli he got his reward, and hinted at what may be to come over the next few monthsJust past the half hour at a chilly, angsty Anfield Mo Salah was suddenly free in space on the edge of the Napoli box, scampering in on goal in that bouncy style, hair flapping, legs whirring like a cartoon kangaroo. Salah had time to look up, pause and nudge a doomed pass across the six-yard box in the vague direction of Sadio Mané. There was a groan from the stands, but not much of a groan. The one thing they know for sure about Salah around here is that he just keeps on keeping on. Some footballers are relentless in a pained kind of way, tied to the rack, teeth clenched, head down. Salah has a lightness to him. He keeps coming because he knows in the end the game will open up, that his ability to glide and spring sideways with preternatural speed will find the right pocket of space.It didn’t take long. Two minutes later James Milner fed a quick pass in to Salah’s feet in the same position. He took the ball on the move, veering away from Mário Rui like a speedskater. Then came the moment that made the moment, a piece of embroidery so cleverly conceived you might have easily missed it, might easily have failed to understand why Kalidou Koulibaly stopped suddenly, the high-speed feint and switch of feet leaving him looking like a man stumbling through a reed-strewn pond in a pair of outsized fishing waders.Salah clipped the ball hard and low past David Ospina without breaking stride. From a mix-and-match opening half hour fraught with dead ends Liverpool were 1-0 up: the game, the night, the group just about sliding their way.It was a significant moment in Salah’s own drama too. His focus has narrowed in recent weeks, his edge returned although it turns out even a jaded second-season Salah is good enough to be the Premier League’s top scorer in mid-December.There was one small thing missing, though. Despite his impressive numbers Salah had yet to score against genuinely strong opponents since the Champions League semi-final against Roma, his goals coming against West Ham, Brighton (twice), Southampton, Huddersfield, Red Star Belgrade, Cardiff, Fulham, Watford and Bournemouth. In the same period he had failed to score against Real Madrid, Tottenham, PSG (twice), Chelsea (twice), Napoli, Manchester City and Arsenal.Not that he ever looked worried at any stage, playing always with his head up, feet still possessed with that weird creative magic. And here it always felt like Salah might make the difference on a breezy, finger-numbing night at Anfield. Ah, yes. Those Magical European Nights we hear so much about: sometimes a cliché is no less true for being a cliché. As ever the Kop was a shared pageantry of flags and banners, that single tier stretching right up into the eaves to create a noise-funnel effect the length of the pitch.In the buildup to this game there was a conviction Liverpool would return to their most aggressive style. Once again Jürgen Klopp had picked his three sturdiest workhorses in Milner, Jordan Henderson and Georginio Wijnaldum, the midfield equivalent of being marched three times around a pub car park in a headlock. Against Paris Saint-Germain that trio had been outmanoeuvred by slicker, cuter opponents. Here the job was quite simple, to stand toe-to-toe and create the orderly disorder on which the front three likes to feed.Napoli came out to meet Liverpool head on in the early stages, led by the steamrollering Allan, a muscular presence in those spaces between the lines. In Naples Salah had spent most of the game in Allan’s big pocket. It worked for a while here too. Napoli pressed high, the crowd began to fret. Time and again Liverpool punted the ball diagonally across the pitch towards the Napoli left flank, a pre-hatched plan to find that space in behind Mário Rui that would eventually lead to the game’s crucial break.And throughout Salah was hugely involved, a leader from the front in a way that has not always been the case, even in those sunlit days last season where he just seemed to float free at the front of things, wreaking his own dreamy havoc. He touched the ball 79 times, which really is a lot of times for a player in his role. He dribbled and shot and won headers.On the other side of the pitch Andy Robertson was again exhilaratingly good. And there was a moment in the final seconds that was just as important as Salah’s goal. Alisson’s save from Arkadiusz Milik was a mind-bending piece of brilliance: a hand thrust up to claw the ball away at zero distance, saving Liverpool’s season in this competition and a save that was worth between £10m and £60m on its own. Good piece of business, that.As the game dwindled away towards its anxious final knockings this was not quite the crowd-driven evisceration some had hoped for. But for Salah, and Liverpool’s measured, slow-burn season, it might be just as significant."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c19bdedb9cb65c825d98c8503d623ec4821b48/0_322_3474_2084/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6345f53643a3d49b71edf8c7e6d1bb66","title":"the best apps for family bliss","story":"A selection of games, tools and platforms to help family life run that bit smootherWith junk food available on every street, it’s never been more important for children to get to grips with home cooking and proper nutrition.

My Nokia 3210, unveiled the previous year, was state of the art. Competitively priced, lightweight (we thought) … there were even different coloured covers!Fast-forward 18 years and my daughter Alice – 12, new to phone ownership and not easily impressed – is examining this piece of communication history. In her first year of secondary school, with her interests and independence growing fast, Alice uses a smartphone to communicate with friends, organise activities, listen to music and take photos, as well as to contact and be contacted by us.In recent years, parents of communication-hungry tweens faced a predicament: offer their child a smartphone with unfettered access to the world wide web (and everything that comes with it) or pick up an older phone, with limitations imposed by more primitive technology. Now, thankfully, there’s a third way.Alice will be comparing the Nokia with the Verve IMO S2 with monqi – a new phone exclusive to Tesco Mobile, and designed specifically for children and young teenagers easing into mobile technology. How will it and the classic Nokia shape up in her fickle fingers?First up, the Nokia 3210.“It’s really heavy,” she exclaims. “The screen is tiny. It looks old.” She is examining the handset with the sort of sceptical curiosity she might extend towards a fax machine, or acarrier pigeon.“I guess you could call people and text them,” shesays. “Very slowly,” she adds, noticing the three-letters-per-key setup. No emojis. That’s not good. Her face briefly brightens as she spots the hash key. “Wait. What did you actually use that for back then?”The lack of a camera bothers her even more than the no internet access, presumably because the latter is available via our home computer. Not being able to listen to music is another shortcoming.With her reaction so far fairly scathing, it is time to reveal the phone’s killer feature: Snake! This, initially at least, is a hit. “That’s quite good!” she decides, setting about the game. Her initial enthusiasm proves short-lived. “Actually, it’s pretty boring.”Asked when the phone might have been designed, Alice hazards a guess at 1990. At almost triple her lifetime ago, that is ancient history for her.Does the 3210 have “old skool” appeal perhaps? “No,” she says firmly. “Retro is good in clothes, but not in phones.”Case closed. On to the IMO S2 with monqiThis, it would seem, is more like it. “It looks nice. It feels smooth to hold and use and it has a good-size screen – not too big or too small,” says Alice, back in her comfort zone.First of all she checks out the photo options, pulling a series of silly selfie faces. There are two cameras, I tell her, peering at the manual. “Of course there are, front and back,” she says, raising an eyebrow at my ignorance.“It’s really easy to work out,” she says, connecting to the wifi and starting to browse the website of a clothing brand she covets. As well as online window shopping, Alice uses her phone to watch clips from favourite films and musicals, to research and help with homework (foreign language dictionaries for example), and to stream music and contact friends via – parent approved – social media.She makes the odd phone call too, mainly to me, often to ask if she can go to a friend’s, and frequently followed by a call to request a lift home.Taking photos is a favourite pastime, and Alice likes the editing features on the IMO S2. She quickly starts to play around with tints and effects, writing captions and adding characters to her pictures.Intrinsic to the IMO S2 is the monqi operating system, which enables parents – having installed the parent app on their own phones – to monitor and shape how the child’s phone is used.Functions include: setting time limits on usage (remote shut down at homework or dinner time, for instance), blocking unsuitable internet content (monqi’s bespoke browser has built-in filters), monitoring internet and phone usage in real time, and checking on whereabouts. There is also a family chat option – a controlled alternative to third-party messenger apps.“Parental controls are a good idea, especially for younger children when you definitely want to know they are only seeing appropriate things,” says Alice, as she scrolls through the monqi functions.She admits that time limits make sense too. “Especially at first it’s good to make sure it isn’t being used all the time. I do lots of other activities, which keep me busy, but it can sometimes be tempting to have my phone on too long, especially if lots of group conversations are going on.”Having a smartphone has been helpful for settling into secondary school, she says – facilitating new friendships and enabling her to keep in touch with old classmates too.“A smartphone makes it easy to swap numbers and send a message or join a chat with your school friends,” says Alice. “With an old-style phone you would have to call someone direct, and that would feel more daunting,” she adds.The monqi system ensures this is all done safely new contacts are approved through the parent app, so mums and dads get a chance to check they are legitimate and appropriate.The IMO S2 meets with Alice’s approval. “Your parents look after you, and this setup is another way of them doing that. I’d be very happy to have this phone,” she says.Although used to tales of her parents’ seemingly prehistoric analogue childhoods, her foray into early mobile phones has given her a new sense of how technology has changed. “It has made me really appreciate how much we can do now.”Not having today’s smartphone technology would make her life more complicated, she says. “I think we are very lucky today. Maybe those early phones were ok for someone older,” she says in a placatory tone, looking straight at me.I think we have a winner.Visit Tesco Mobile to find out more about the IMO S2 with monqi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0896450882ebe852943fe6091e587c189199152/0_72_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47fc95829c1d7604f2df0a51ea6be8b2","title":"i feel more independent one 11 year old on her first year with a phone","story":"Amelia, aged 11, from Bristol shares her experiences of phone ownership – from the ‘contract’ she signed with her parents to getting lost on the way to schoolI finally got a phone last September, just as I started secondary school. I was one of the last people in my class to get one and it felt like I’d been waiting forever. Most of the others had one in year 6. My parents said I didn’t need one, as I was only walking down the road to school. But I think it would have made sense.Negotiating a contractWe talked a lot before the phone arrived. Mostly about when and where I could use it. But I was happy I was allowed a smartphone! I know one girl who just has this old-looking one. My parents and I decided we’d come up with a kind of contract between us. This is what we agreed:I was mostly OK with the rules. But not the social media one, as loads of my friends have Instagram! It was an improvement on the first version, though. That one said I was only allowed my phone downstairs!Coping with peer pressureThe phone has changed my life. These changes are mostly good, but I do feel that some bits have not gone quite as well. You feel like you can never make a mistake in a message.One of the better things is I feel more independent. I can plan when to see friends without asking my parents. If I walk 40 minutes to school the phone makes me feel safe. When I first started the walk, I took a wrong turning and ended up lost in the docks. All I could see was boats! Thankfully, I could call my dad. He helped me.But I sometimes feel my parents get cross with me more often now. The other day I was on my phone messaging and my mum started getting annoyed. She told me it was unhealthy to spend so much time looking at a screen, and I should “interact more with the real world”. I got angry and shouted back.Getting used to phone lifeAt first I thought it was a bit weird that my parents could look at my phone whenever. But I don’t really care or notice now. I don’t go online much. I mainly use my phone to chat or play games. I use the computer in the kitchen for the internet.Sometimes my phone distracts me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation and I get a message, I’ll turn to my phone instead. And if I hear a notification, I’ll rush to check my phone.But I’d never be without my phone now.Visit Tesco Mobile for more information and content on families and mobile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9ebdfd732764928a71b7c35bef8b8818823df55/0_19_1714_1028/master/1714.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8ab69a94870b46e156bb355d81f43a7","title":"quiz litty shook or goat can you talk tween","story":"Finstagram, spilling tea and looking snatched.

I don’t have a clear reason.”But his film offers a startling number of clues. Avicii: True Stories, which will debut on Netflix in the US, UK and Australia on 28 December, presents an unflinching portrait of an artist coming apart. With fly-on-the-wall proximity, the camera shows Avicii repeatedly, and emphatically, telling everyone around him how exhausted, anxious and sick he is. “There was never an end to the shows, even when I hit a wall,” the DJ says early in the film. “My life is all about stress.”“He’s a shell of what he used to be,” says a friend in the film, while another describes him as “a ticking timebomb”.It all builds to the point where, late in the documentary, Avicii flatly says of touring: “It will kill me.”Eventually, he did do something about it. At the end of 2016, Avicii fired his manager and retired from the road. The film positions that decision as its happy ending. It culminates with scenes of a tanned Avicii on a tranquil beach in Madagascar, planning a less stressful future by sticking to just producing music in the studio.The director admits that this ending now seems chillingly false. Of course, it read very differently in October 2017, when the film had a very limited, initial release. It only ran in Scandinavian movie theaters and on Netflix in western Europe, buttressed by a single showing in select US theaters. Just six months later, Avicii died and while details weren’t confirmed, his family said he “could not go on any longer”. He was 28.Because of that whiplash turn of events, rumors swirled that Netflix had abruptly pulled the film. But, according to Tsikurishvili, “the film was never supposed to have a wider release back then. What happened was that people tried to watch the movie in the US and UK and couldn’t find it. So, they ran with the story that it had been pulled.”The documentary’s new, wide release will inevitably invite a forensic scrutiny. Even the director says he now sees the film “in a very different way. Watching it, I felt everything you can think of. It was a very emotional experience.”Especially since Tsikurishvili and Avicii had bonded so deeply during their marathon filming sessions. The director first met the DJ, who was born Tim Bergling, six years ago at a dinner in their mutual home city of Stockholm. The musician asked the director to helm a documentary about a charity project he had started which donated $1m to African hunger programs. “It clicked from the beginning,” Tsikurishvili said of their relationship.Neither he nor Avicii had any preconceived notions of what the focus of the documentary would be. But they did know they already had a dramatic story to tell. In his early 20s, the DJ had gone from sleeping on people’s couches to becoming a superstar artist, generating tens of millions of dollars while headlining festivals around the world. A key figure in his rise was his manager at the time, Ash Pournouri, who comes off in the film as savvy and dedicated, but also driven to the point of obsession. Avicii’s talent gave Pournouri plenty to work with.His doctors compounded the problem by enabling a dependence on drugs. They wrote scores of prescriptions for opioids such as Percocet and gabapentin. In the film, Avicii responds by shrugging: “I guess they know what they’re doing.”His passivity bled into his relationship with the business. For much of the film, Avicii lets his manager drive him. “I didn’t take the time to think about what I really wanted to do,” he says. “I just went along with the flow. I was running after an ideal happiness that wasn’t my own.”In the film, even his manager admits that “Tim is going to die, with all the interviews, radio tours and playing. He’ll drop dead.” (Pournouri did not respond to an interview request for this article.)Beyond his exhaustion, it seems Avicii suffered from a kind of social anxiety, which was greatly exacerbated by the demands of fame. “I don’t think he knew what it takes to be as successful as he became,” the director says. “He was never comfortable as the center of attention. He felt stardom is something that human beings have made up. It’s nothing real.”In the footage, Avicii quotes Carl Jung’s insights about introversion, a characteristic he deeply identified with. “I prefer intuition to sensation,” he says.Another source of pressure concerned Avicii’s feeling of obligation to financially support his management team. “He never wanted to do anything to someone else that would cause any problems,” Tsikurishvili says. “He felt responsibility to take care of his co-workers.”Much like Tom Petty, who stayed on the road despite severe health and pain issues, Avicii paid a heavy price for that sense of obligation. The breaking point came before a string of shows in Las Vegas which Avicii felt he had to cancel. Despite his insistence on backing out, Pournouri grouses on camera that the DJ “doesn’t understand the value of money”.As to why the star wanted so uncensored a documentary to be released, the director can only speculate. “All of us, in one way or another, want to share our own stories of who we are and where we come from,” he says. “Tim was such an honest person. He was so honest about himself.”While Tsikurishvili says he never discussed the specifics of the film with its star, he says the last thing Avicii told him, when they met last December, was that he thought the film was great.The director adds: “The documentary gives a very close explanation of how he felt. I’m happy and thankful that we were able to put so many of his years on film, to show others how he really was. As a collaborator, and a film-maker, that’s what I can do for him.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef9a6180b6999a5fcc157ccb3f4317890409e9d/0_115_1818_1091/master/1818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5f9790d286046077b26a22118cafa14","title":"swing ting manchester rave club scene","story":"With its blend of dancehall, afro bashment, UK funky and experimentalism, Swing Ting has spent 10 years ersifying Manchester’s club scene‘Third Saturday of the month, it’s Swing Ting. I’m gonna pay a fiver. I don’t give a shit who’s playing,” Ruben Platt states, illustrating the attitude of the Manchester club night’s clientele. He’s drinking tea with fellow party co-founder Balraj Samrai at a cafe between industrial Ancoats, where their studio is, and the Northern Quarter, where they’ll later open doors for the basement rave. The former area is undergoing gentrification whereas the latter has been transformed by it already. As Swing Ting approaches its 10th birthday, they’ve learned what to change and what should stay the same in order to hold their corner.They’ve maintained a monthly residency in Soup Kitchen’s 200-capacity basement since summer 2011. It’s barebones inside: down the steps and on to the floor, the room is wide and shallow with hard ground. Minimal seating lines the far side, next to a grungy bathroom you could easily miss in the dark. The venue has a habit of tweaking things, so today there’s reddish lighting and new subs in the soundsystem, but the bar is crammed into its usual alcove. The stripped-back nature of the spot allows the friendly dancehall party, and their motley crew of dancers, to cultivate their own vibe of smiles, wines and gunfingers.In town with a fairly central location and cheap, on-the-door tickets, Swing Ting attracts plenty of walk-ins along with its regular crowd of millennials, students and delegates from Manchester’s disparate music scenes. Samrai recalls that this wasn’t always the case: “When we put bassline on the flyer – bashment, dancehall, hip-hop and garage – most of the time alarm bells were ringing for people. It was different in town back then, very segmented.” The club has a reputation for hiring nicer bouncers than most, and Platt suggests the recent surge of interest in dancehall and reggaeton has also helped people feel welcome inside.But Swing Ting has always been about bringing different groups and scenes together. Samrai and Platt met while studying in the city in 2006, and like so many others in the UK underground, their time at university would prove formative. They’d go to clubs to socialise: funk, soul and bass night Friends and Family at dancehallreggae night Hot Milk they’d meet Joey B, who’d later become a Swing Ting resident they’d trek to Subdub at Leeds West Indian Centre to understand the importance of the soundsystem. They formed links with a wave of Mancunian talent: Jon K, Illum Sphere and Jonny Dub who would run the cutting-edge club night Hoya:Hoya, Italo-disco connoisseur Il Bosco, and Boomkat’s head experimental enthusiast Conor Thomas. “Dancehall, electronica, experimental, but with Fat City’s soul-funk legacy,” Samrai puts it, explaining how Swing Ting would tie all of this together in sound and audience.The crew’s resident DJs reflect the party’s open approach to mixing – a rare attitude around the time of its inception. Samrai and Platt are fascinated with well-engineered soundsystem music, which lends itself well to their continuous, fluid blends. Joey B packs dubplates in abundance, though tonight he also reaches for a new Tyga track. Murlo’s silky electronic riddims bridge gaps between the genres. Then there’s Fox, the singjaying host and crowd favourite. Most importantly, the crowd can trust the crew to fill in for each other, with every member bringing flavours from all across the Swing Ting spectrum. “We have enough not-residents-but-basically-residents that we could just book them on a rotation,” Platt admits, speaking to close crew such as Brackles, Florentino and Hipsters Don’t Dance as well as kindred spirits across the Atlantic like the Large, Jubilee and Dre Skull.Structure of the nights is flexible and Samrai relishes the slow burn of warming up: “We’ve had some wicked nights where it’s got to half one, maybe even two, and the tempo’s not gone above 110bpm. It sets it up so well for the guests, cos they can just come in and smash it.” Tonight’s headliner is Bamz, a producer and DJ known for handling the decks on tour for rapper Nadia Rose. The residents tee up Dave’s Funky Friday which she obliterates with Giggs’ Whippin’ Excursion, before shelling down UK funky remixes of chart hits, true to the formula. “It’s good reflecting on it afterwards,” Samrai says. “I think Murlo was saying, ‘what happened to the garage warm-up sets?’ and we were like, ‘oh, yeah’ – I guess we’ve got so many afro-bashment bangers to play, you just get lost in that.”Early, pre-Soup Kitchen DIY days saw Samrai and Platt carting hired decks and a soundsystem between house parties, student spots and Charlie’s karaoke bar in Chinatown. Holding down a solid venue helped them find time to develop as a studio production unit and launch a label arm to keep Manchester at the forefront of club music. They’ve amassed an international network with the likes of Jamaica’s Equiknoxx crew and have sought to consciously ersify their bookings in recent years, supporting more women and black artists to better represent street rave in its rawest form. Swing Ting began with “no mission beyond being a really fun time” as Platt puts it, though the pair agree there’s always something to improve. “We’re finding that our audience are starting to grow up a little bit more and come out less often,” Samrai muses. “It asks questions: Do you wanna appeal to younger people? Do you wanna have a different generation heading things up and taking things forward? And maybe we can set up a cafe somewhere …”But if tonight is anything to go by, Swing Ting aren’t moving any time soon once again a kaleidoscopic crowd of cavorting Mancs keeps the residents at work after closing time, basslines bubbly and bright even as the lights come on.“This one has been played nearly every session since its creation in early 2013. It was an anthem at the party before finally being released on Fox’s Musik EP in 2016.”“We love this riddim from the funky bashment era which coincided with us first starting the night – it’s stood the test of time neatly. We also have dubplate specials from Fox \u0026amp Lady Chann on the riddim so it continues to get played on the regular.”“First heard on a mix via Ronin, a dancer, DJ and part of the Swing Ting extended family, in 2015. Hyphy-style rap production combined with dembow fills and featuring Trinidadian soca queen Destra – it couldn’t have been more fitting for our club!”“A favourite from Charlie’s days to the present. This track is part UK funky, groovy soca and rowdy bashment so naturally demands an immediate reload if it gets played!”“A lights up singalong moment at almost every party after it became an unexpected city choice, due to being played for the entirety of a Levelz minibus journey to a gig, so the story goes. Alexx’s poignant vocal touches Mancunian hearts in a unique way.”• Swing Ting’s 10th Birthday takes place at Manchester’s Soup Kitchen on Saturday 15 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5f55eb9bb4370d774212eb5f970fc0d446617b4/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d133db68cfe1db634b8e9106d1efcbb 660w","title":"eu steps up plans for no deal brexit as merkel rebuffs may","story":"Prime minister’s critics lobby for no-confidence vote amid anger over her handling of Brexit dealTheresa May’s grip on power appears to be slipping as speculation grows at Westminster that she could face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs exasperated at her last-minute decision to pull the meaningful vote.While the prime minister took a whistlestop tour of European capitals on Tuesday in an effort to win fresh concessions from EU leaders, MPs were lobbying colleagues to submit letters of no confidence in her leadership to Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers.Friends of Brady refused to deny reports he would meet May after her regular appearance at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday lunchtime. He would have to inform her first, before calling any no confidence vote.There was fevered speculation at Westminster on Tuesday night that the threshold of 48 letters – which would trigger a vote – had finally been reached.The former environment secretary Owen Paterson, a prominent leave campaigner who has been a trenchant critic of the prime minister’s approach, made his own letter of no confidence public. He said May’s deal represented a series of “broken promises” and was the culmination of “more than two years of poor government decision-making”.Several prominent Tories, including Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd, are known to be contemplating running if May loses a confidence vote.Many of the most prominent May sceptics were wary of making predictions, bruised by the last time the letters failed to materialise. One Brexiter MP said he knew colleagues who had spent the day lobbying others to send in their letters. Another said: “Do I think we’re there yet tonight? I’m not sure, but I think we will be tomorrow.” Others played down the prospect of the threshold being reached.Brady said last month that party rules made clear any vote of no confidence should take place “expeditiously”.“The intention is clear that if it were to happen, it ought to be a test of opinion, very quickly, in order to clear the air and get it out of the way so that the party, the government at the moment, can move on,” he said.A vote of Tory MPs could take place within days and if May lost it she would not be able to stand in the subsequent leadership contest, which could run through the Christmas recess.Meanwhile the EU is moving into full no-deal mode, with May’s shock decision to pull Tuesday’s vote on her Brexit deal prompting Brussels’ chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to warn privately of a sudden escalation of risk.May is due to hold a cabinet meeting on Wednesday afternoon before flying to Dublin to meet the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar.As she shuttled between EU capitals on a whistlestop diplomatic tour aimed at salvaging her deal, the prime minister said the hastily scheduled cabinet meeting would discuss what further steps the government needed to take in the event of a no-deal Brexit.One cabinet source said ministers had been told they would see “quite an alarming no-deal paper” that would emphasise the need to step up preparations.With May declining to set a date when her deal will be brought back to parliament for ratification, and her spokesman saying only that it would be before 21 January, France advised its fellow member states that planning for a cliff-edge Brexit had to be their priority.France’s EU affairs minister, Nathalie Loiseau, on a visit to Brussels, suggested her country’s president, Emmanuel Macron, would urge EU leaders at a summit starting on Thursday to take responsibility for their own preparations rather than be sucked into May’s domestic political drama.Loiseau said: “We are very concerned about the delay in the vote on the withdrawal agreement, because this withdrawal agreement is the best deal possible, it is even the only possible agreement. It has been negotiated for months.”Barnier is understood to have given a stark analysis of the situation in a meeting with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, and his fellow commissioners, suggesting that the danger of a complete breakdown had significantly increased.The European commission is to publish fresh no-deal warnings next week. During a visit to Berlin, May was reportedly told by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, that there could be no renegotiation and that any appeals for help should be made in Brussels rather than brought to the capitals.Varadkar took the unusual step of suggesting to the Irish parliament that it was still in Downing Street’s gift to prevent a no-deal by revoking article 50 and turning its back on Brexit.He said: “The option is there to revoke article 50, the option is there to extend article 50 and, where there may not be a majority for anything or at least any deal at the moment in the House of Commons, I do believe there’s a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal scenario.”Cabinet sources said the prime minister had warned colleagues on Monday’s cabinet conference call, when she discussed postponing the vote, that reopening the withdrawal agreement would be risky, not least because Varadkar could insist that the Northern Ireland-only backstop be restored to the text.May held talks with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in The Hague on Tuesday morning before going on to Berlin for talks with Merkel.The German chancellor reported to the parliamentary faction of the CDUCSU alliance of which she is a member that she had excluded the possibility with May of reopening Brexit negotiations. “We said that there will be no further opening of the exit deal,” Merkel said.The prime minister later conducted talks with Juncker and Donald Tusk, the European council president.Following his meeting with May, Tusk tweeted that the pair had a “long and frank” discussion. “Clear that EU27 wants to help,” he wrote. “The question is how.”Earlier in the day, Juncker had told the European parliament that there was “no room whatsoever for renegotiation”, but that the EU could offer “clarifications and interpretations” to help the prime minister secure MPs’ support.Many Labour MPs including the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, have argued that there is a parliamentary majority to stop a no-deal exit, calling it a “false choice” between May’s deal and no deal. However, Commons officials believe it would be very difficult in practice.MPs opposed to no deal had believed one legal route could be to amend the primary legislation, such as an immigration bill, that would be needed for a semi-orderly no-deal exit to allow parliament to insist on an extension to article 50.Yet experts have come to believe that those amendments may not be within the scope of the bills and that the amendments could not impose conditions on whether no-deal happens or not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc1e39a51a434e55373cdabc10ccc3016f792f53/0_170_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db17956b8c56af6ae73a6fe375726fa8","title":"the race to replace theresa may the likely candidates","story":"Seven Conservatives are in the frame should the prime minister lose a no-confidence voteIf a vote of no confidence topples the prime minister, there is no shortage of candidates who may be quietly organising their bids to be her replacement:The former Brexit secretary has pole-vaulted over his rivals to become the first choice of many Eurosceptics. Raab’s credibility is perhaps higher than his predecessor David Davis because he had a more active relationship with Brussels, battled through to the end stage and resigned when he thought he had been overruled.He has not endorsed any leadership challenge to May and, like many of his rivals, almost certainly believes there is no personal advantage in doing so. He has the credentials as a Brexit “true believer” but is also seen as being from new generation of Tory MPs who have less baggage than some cabinet veterans.His name is never far from the lips of people talking about May’s successor but, apart from his instant condemnation of the deal on the day it was published, Johnson has kept his head down as the momentum moved towards plotting against May.Officially his allies stick to the line that it is the policy and not the prime minister that needs to be changed. However, he is certain to stand if there is a contest and he has a dedicated following. However, should he be successful, it could cause a schism in the party, a handful of pro-European MPs have suggested they would find that so distasteful that they would quit the party if he won.Gove has a dedicated follower base among MPs which straddles the ide including remainers such as Nicky Morgan and Brexiter converts such as Nick Boles. His decision to remain in the cabinet is a calculation that is likely to be informed by his betrayal of Johnson in the last leadership contest, for which his reputation has suffered.Many allies and aides are said to have advised him to resign from the cabinet but he has decided to stay within the tent and lobby for change from inside. His chances very much depend on whether he is punished for remaining loyal or rewarded by middle-ground Tories who recognise he has tried to make the deal work.Freshly back from a remarkably short time in the wilderness after her disastrous response to the Windrush scandal, Rudd is the firm favourite of remainers and soft Brexiter Tories on the party’s centre-right wing.She is the most likely to be the “stop Boris” candidate and that could work very well in her favour. However, she has several thing going against her, as an easy target for Labour attacks over her time at the Home Office and the very small matter of her Hastings constituency where her majority is very small.Hunt is clearly ambitious for the role and could end up being a safe choice for Tory MPs as an experienced cabinet minister. He backed remain but has become an outspoken Brexiter who makes multiple tough interventions in cabinet – which are then widely briefed.Hunt has had a remarkable ability to survive damaging scandals, including during his time as health secretary where he withstood multiple NHS winter crises and the junior doctors strikes. He may be able to walk the tightrope between leavers and remainers to win a contest, but he is unlikely to fire up many followers.Javid is another ambitious cabinet minister who has been keen to convey his conversion to Brexit from remain. A protege of George Osborne, he is said to have been instinctively Eurosceptic but only decided to back remain in the first place in order to please the then-chancellor.However, Javid and Hunt are not members of Andrea Leadsom’s “breakfast club” of five Brexiter cabinet ministers who have formed a band to try to persuade the prime minister to change course on the withdrawal agreement – suggesting they are not trusted as true believers yet.The international development secretary is probably the cabinet minister who has come closest to quitting but has taken a small shuffle back from the brink. She is an ambitious Brexiter whose name was mentioned by Jacob Rees-Mogg as one of his favoured candidates.One of her tactics has been an attempt to persuade May to allow Tory MPs a free vote on the final deal, a proposal that has baffled No 10, but one that Mordaunt may hope endears her to backbench Tories to show she is fighting their corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fca5cc8227834bb75116b15b65406af6c3b5d58d/0_56_2167_1300/master/2167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1a83a6cb2359825409bf07a9077e38","title":"brexit deal latest theresa may eu juncker tells may deal could be clarified but no room whatsoever for renegotiation politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s politics, as Theresa May travels to The Hague, Berlin and Brussels to seek EU support for concessions on the Brexit dealWe’re closing down this live blog now. Thanks for sticking with us late into the night – as well as for all the comments. Here’s a summary of the evening’s events:You can read a summary of the day’s earlier events here. And our full story is here:Earlier this evening, the Sinn Féin president, Mary-Lou McDonald, told Theresa May the backstop was “non-negotiable” and demanded an Irish unity referendum in the case of a no-deal Brexit.She and Pearse Doherty, the Sinn Féin Irish parliament member, spoke to May for about 20 minutes on Tuesday. McDonald said:We raised concerns that we are facing into a no deal or a crash Brexit which would be a disaster for Ireland. And we reminded Mrs May that, in those circumstances, a unity referendum must be called as a matter of urgency.As I told the taoiseach today, Irish unity is the ultimate contingency to protect our interests in the event of a crash Brexit.As if to illustrate the tenuous nature of the reports for anyone getting carried away, City AM’s Owen Bennett contradicts earlier claims that Brady intends to speak to the prime minister after PMQs tomorrow:The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg previously said she had been told he did intend to do so:What is not in doubt is that the chief whip and the chairman of the Conservative party have been in No 10 this evening as the PM returns from the continent. And, as Newsnight’s Nick Watt points out:Damien Green, a close ally of Theresa May and former first secretary of state, has told the BBC’s Newsnight programme that, if 48 letters have gone in, it will be seen by the public as “an act of monumental self-indulgence” on the part of Tory MPs.People outside the Westminster bubble will be looking at this and thinking we’ve got a prime minister doing really difficult negotiations, at the sharp end of one of the most important decisions for 50 years. This is a really important matter for the country, not just the Conservative party, but for the country. To undermine the prime minister at this stage, seems to be, to be wholly wrongTheresa May’s grip on power appears to be slipping as speculation grows at Westminster that she could face a vote of no confidence from Tory MPs, exasperated at her last-minute decision to pull the meaningful vote.While the prime minister took a whistlestop tour of European capitals on Tuesday in a bid to win fresh concessions from EU leaders, MPs were lobbying colleagues to submit letters of no confidence in her leadership to Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.Friends of Brady refused to deny reports he would meet May after her regular appearance at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday lunchtime. He would have to inform her first before calling any no confidence vote.There was fevered speculation at Westminster on Tuesday night that the threshold of 48 letters – which would trigger a vote – had finally been reached. May has recently arrived back at Downing Street, where her chief whip was waiting for her.Several prominent Tories, including Boris Johnson, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd, are known to be contemplating running if May loses a confidence vote.Many of the most prominent May sceptics were wary of making predictions, bruised by the last time the letters failed to materialise. One Brexiter MP said he knew colleagues who had spent the day lobbying others to send in their letters. Another said: “Do I think we’re there yet tonight? I’m not sure but I think we will be tomorrow.” Others played down the prospect of the threshold being reached.Elsewhere in the letter, Paterson writes that the prime minister failed to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, tried to bounce her ministers into supporting her and approached negotiations like a “feeble and unworthy” supplicant.These mistakes have eroded trust in the government, to the point where I and many others can no longer take the prime minister at her word ... She has repeatedly said ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’, but it is clear her objective was to secure a deal at any cost.The former Northern Ireland and environment secretary, Owen Paterson, has added his name to the list of Tory MPs who have lost confidence in Theresa May’s leadership. In his letter to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, Graham Brady, Paterson says May’s “proposed ‘deal’ is so bad that it cannot be considered anything other than a betrayal of clear manifesto promises”.Paterson, who has criticised May’s approach in the past, had his letter published in the Daily . In it, he writes:No amount of tinkering will yield a majority in parliament for this deal. The government needs to consider more boldly the possible alternatives which might command that support. President Tusk offered just such an alternative in March: a wide-ranging, zero-tariff free trade agreement.That deal foundered on the question of the Northern Ireland border, but existing techniques and processes can resolve this. From my October meeting with Michel Barnier, I know that a willingness exists on the EU side to explore these possibilities more fully. The meeting also confirmed that Tusk’s offer is still on the table.Throughout this process, I have sought to support the government. The conclusion is now inescapable that the prime minister is the blockage to the wide-ranging free trade agreement offered by Tusk which would be in the best interests of the country and command the support of Parliament.I, therefore, have no confidence in Theresa May as prime minister and leader of the Conservative party and ask that you hold a vote of no confidence.As previously noted, we’ve been here before. And, the last time we were here, we had a look at the likely runners and riders, should Tory MPs declare no confidence in Theresa May’s leadership. Here they are:It is perhaps worth noting that, since this was written, Boris Johnson has faced a torrid time in the Commons at the hands of his own Tory colleagues, suggesting his stock may have fallen.While it should be stressed that there’s been no confirmation that the requisite 48 letters have been submitted, here’s our guide to what would follow if they were:Numerous journalists are now saying they have been told that enough Tory MPs have submitted – or are due to submit – letters opposing Theresa May’s leadership to force a confidence vote. They are citing unnamed sources.We have, of course, been here before.A French politician has taken the lead in ensuring there is no “catastrophe” on the Dover-Calais route in the event of no-deal.Xavier Bertrand, a former minister, invited the inter-goverment border delivery group to Lille on Monday. The Road Haulage Association was there and it said the UK government’s plans for customs declarations would mean eight hours of paperwork for a typical lorry.Bertrand told the  he decided to take the lead and has lobbied to get funds from the EU to get Calais ready.Calais is now urgently putting plans in place for temporary border inspection posts and the recruitment of some of the 250 customs officials apparently needed.Boris Johnson has revealed he is dieting and has lost 12 pounds in two weeks after deciding he needed to give up drink and “delicious late-night binges of chorizo and cheese” – just as he could be about to embark on a bid to become prime minister.Writing in the Spectator, the former foreign secretary said he had realised he was “carting around 16-and-a-half stone” after visiting a French doctor and concluded he needed to try to slim down as the UK was leaving the European Union.Modestly comparing his weight to the state of the body politic, Johnson said he hoped to be 15 stone by Christmas, for the first time since he left university, “to toast the moment” when MPs force May to ditch the Northern Ireland backstop.That he said, would amount to “the change that will launch us on a nimbler, lither and more dynamic future,” he wrote, arguing: “If I can do it, so can we all.”Johnson remains one of the favourites to succeed May, should the vulnerable prime minister be dethroned in the aftermath of her decision to pull the vote on her unpopular Brexit deal.His decision to have a haircut at the end of last week prompted speculation that he was readying himself for a run at the leadership, by tidying his normally unruly blond mop in an effort to make himself look more presentable to Tory MPs.Tom Watson, reacting to Boris diet revelation, said: “I applaud Boris Johnson’s diet, I know what it’s like being a middle aged man trying to get fit, but the truth is he won’t lose weight if he keeps trying to have his cake and eat it.”Turning away from the Brexit machinations for a moment: The Labour MP, Kate Osamor, has apologised for her “emotional outbursts” as she deals with a row over her son’s drug conviction and has asked to be afforded the space to care for her family.Osamor resigned as shadow international development secretary on 1 December – the same day the Times reported she had verbally abused one of its journalists. The paper said its reporter was seeking Osamor’s comment for a story on allegations she had misled the public.That’s all from me for today.Theresa May has recorded a clip for broadcasters in Brussels. She has already met the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the European council president, Donald Tusk, and she said there was a “shared determination” in Europe to deliver assurances on the backstop that might satisfy MPs. She said:What has been shown to me from those meetings is there is a shared determination to deal with this issue and address this problem ...The deal we’ve negotiated is a deal that honours the referendum ... It’s the best deal available indeed it’s the only deal available. And the backstop, which is the issue that parliament has raised, is a necessary guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland. And whatever outcome you want, whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there is no deal available that does not have a backstop within it. But we don’t want the backstop to be used and, if it is, we want to be certain that it is only temporary. And it’s those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days.Asked whether she had been told that the 48 letters to trigger a no-confidence motion in her as Conservative leader had been received, May said: “No, I have been here in Europe dealing with the issue I have promised parliament I would be dealing with.”Carwyn Jones has bowed out as first minister of Wales after nine years leading the country.During his resignation speech in Cardiff, Jones described his feelings as “bittersweet” - he said he was sad to stand down but proud of what he had achieved.Jones received a standing ovation from most fellow assembly members. However, Labour AM Jack Sargeant, the son of Carl Sargeant, who was found hanged four days after he was sacked by Jones as a minister amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour to women, remained in his seat.Before the resignation speech, Sargeant issued a statement in which he said it would be “a real slap in the face” if Jones was given a peerage.Jack Sargeant, who replaced his father as AM for Alyn and Deeside, said: Nothing could be more distressing for the family and friends of Carl to know that such an accolade could be bestowed when there are so many unanswered questions regarding the first minister’s conduct.That apart, the mood in the chamber was respectful and jovial, with political rivals paying tribute to Jones’ command of his wide brief and his steadfastness.Jones’s Labour party colleague, Mark Drakeford, is set to replace him on Wednesday. Jones said: Mark is someone who can effortlessly match both principles and pragmatism, and I have no doubt at all that he will make a superb first minister of Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/288a0b7ede0012d0c4c11b1e6b1067aef0a74d05/0_25_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3178d56de2a03b7b6c9f1a74d213f79e","title":"samaritans thousands calls helpline festive christmas loneliness isolation","story":"Charity, which had 11,000 calls to helpline last Christmas Day, notes problems of loneliness and isolation for young and oldThe Samaritans expect to receive hundreds of thousands of calls over the festive period, with figures revealing that one in three people who contacted the charity on Christmas Day last year were seeking help with loneliness.The charity’s helpline, which offers confidential support to millions of people, received 11,000 calls for help on Christmas Day 2017 and about 400,000 throughout all of last December.The helpline anticipated getting even more calls over the same month this year, with the charity highlighting the issue of loneliness and isolation among young and old people.Theresa May, the prime minister, singled out loneliness as one of the greatest public health challenges facing the nation, as, in October, she launched a strategy to try to combat the issue.As well as loneliness, the other main issues raised by callers to the Samaritans on 25 December were relationship issues, violence, bereavement, drug and alcohol misuse, and physical and mental health issues.Although there was no increase in number of calls on Christmas Day compared with days throughout the rest of the year, there has often been a spike of people ringing the helpline early in the morning and late at night on 25 December.As many as 20,000 trained volunteers attend Samaritans’ helpline round the clock, throughout the year, at 201 branches in the UK and Ireland – fielding more than 5m calls, emails and texts. On Christmas Day 1,500 people do shifts for the charity.Among those volunteering this year will be Emma Gale, who called the helpline herself two years ago after suffering suicidal thoughts as she struggled with health problems.The 42-year-old, who has two children and volunteers in the charity’s Weymouth branch, said: “In the run-up to Christmas 2016 I was sent home from hospital. I felt ill, very lonely and a burden to everyone around me. I decided my family would be far better off without me and made plans to end my life. After driving to a quiet spot I decided to call Samaritans for the first and only time in my life. I just needed someone to talk to, so I didn’t feel so alone.“The impact of that call was huge, it was a listening non-judgmental ear. From there my life completely turned around. The next day I went to a hospital appointment and I got a diagnosis for a rare genetic condition. I will never forget what that Samaritan did for me that Christmas, they gave me the biggest gift possible – the gift of life.”Another volunteer taking to the phones on Christmas Day will be 61-year-old Mary Deery, from Derry, Northern Ireland, who has worked with the helpline for 14 years.Deery, who has six children and cares full-time for her son who has a learning disability and epilepsy, said: “Until you’ve sat in a Samaritans phone room and taken those calls over Christmas you have no idea how tough it can be for a lot of people. Some people assume Samaritans are only about suicide prevention, but there’s so much more to what we do, so many issues we deal with on a daily basis. Christmas feels like a condensed version of that, people’s problems seem to be turned up a notch at this time of year. It can be tough, but it also makes it extremely rewarding.”• In the UK and Irish Republic contact Samaritans on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. • In Australia the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. • Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1836b1a48bcb472fb6aabbc0ea0e2cb1fc5558c8/47_0_2325_1395/master/2325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfc905cb11f0326c184fa3a2d4710a3f","title":"creative alphazero leads way chess computers science","story":"Garry Kasparov is not only humanity’s greatest ever chess player but its highest-profile victim of artificial intelligence. His loss to IBM’s super computer Deep Blue in 1997 made global headlines and left him feeling bitter and, well, blue. Yet there is a warm glint in his eye when he talks about AlphaZero, the game-changing chess programme that took just four hours to teach itself to become the strongest in history.“For me, as a very sharp and attacking player, it is a pleasure watching AlphaZero play,” he said after playing in a charity tournament for Chess in Schools before the London Chess Classic, which runs until Monday. “We all expect machines to play very solid and slow games but AlphaZero just does the opposite. It is surprising to see a machine playing so aggressively, and it also shows a lot of creativity. It is a real breakthrough – and I believe it could be extremely helpful for many other studies in the field of computer science.”Aggressive. Creative. Helpful. These are words you might not normally associate with artificial intelligence. Indeed, they sound rather human. But for AlphaZero’s creator, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Deep Mind, this is just the start of what it might be able to do. As he points out, the next step is to use its capabilities to solve real-world problems – such as protein folding, which is responsible for diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and cystic fibrosis. But he also expects AlphaZero to be able to develop stronger and lighter materials, better medicines and eventually become flexible enough to adapt to new situations.“Deep Blue could play chess well,” explains Hassabis. “But that is all it could do. It couldn’t play noughts and crosses or Connect 4, or any such simple games. In other words, it couldn’t demonstrate two components which are core to what defines human intelligence – our flexible intelligence and our learning capacity.”AlphaZero is different. In a long-awaited paper published in the journal Science last week, the authors explain how it learned to conquer Chess, Go and Shogi by playing millions of games against itself via a process of trial and error called reinforcement learning. In more than 1,000 games against Stockfish, a regular winner of the computer chess world championship, it won 155 games with only six defeats, with the rest drawn.Hassabis was a child chess prodigy, who learned the game aged four and was able to beat his dad three weeks later – indeed, when he started playing competitively he was so small he had to bring a pillow with him to reach the board – and became a strong player. Yet in AlphaZero’s case there was no human input, other than telling it the rules of each game. “In a matter of a few hours it was superhuman,” Hassabis says proudly.The next logical step, he agrees, would be for AlphaZero to attempt to master games with hidden information, such as poker or the computer game Starcraft 2. “Those are big challenges but we’ll have something interesting to say about those in the next 12 months,” he says. “It would very interesting if it could play nine-player Texas No Limit poker, with all the bluffing involved. No computer is yet able to do that but we think AlphaZero could, if we decided to do it.”Before setting up DeepMind in 2010, Hassabis worked in computer games, including being the lead AI programmer on the iconic god game Black \u0026amp White. So does he ever worry that the machines could become our gods? “Powerful technologies, and AI is no different, are neutral in themselves,” he says. “So it depends on society and humanity. How we decide to share the gains is also going to determine whether it is good or bad for the world.”That doesn’t sound entirely like a flat “no”. But Hassabis is a big believer in human ingenuity. “I think that given enough time and enough human brainpower we will address these questions,” he says. “We are at quite a nascent stage when it comes to understanding how AlphaZero is making decisions. Us and many other teams are now reverse-engineering these systems, and building visualisation and other analysis tools. In five years’ time we will have tools that allow us to look inside this black box and really understand what it does.”Kasparov, who last year published Deep Thinking: Where Machine Intelligence Ends and Human Creativity Begins, a well received book on his match against Deep Blue and the future of AI, agrees that we should be optimistic.“I don’t see a shred of intelligence that AI will take over despite this anxiety and fear among the public,” he says. “This is a Hollywood dystopian view. In reality I believe AI will help tremendously and it is much more likely that we and computers will collaborate together for the benefit of humanity.”Hassabis says that he would actually be more worried about the state of the world without the prospect of better AI in the future. “Look at the problems the world faces. We need cures for tragic diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer’s, which are also costly to treat. I think AI could help with those kinds of things as well as helping find new drugs, new materials and to better analyse climate change.”So how would he assuage the fears of doubters? “Ask yourself, if we didn’t have something like AI coming down the line how would we solve these problems?” he says. “Either we are going to need an exponential improvement in human behaviour, so we become more collaborative and less selfish and short term, or we have got to have an exponential improvement in technology to solve the big problems we are creating for ourselves. I don’t see much evidence for the former.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/154a8f73d560e28b5a5d91f74ec725bdde210c1c/0_192_5088_3053/master/5088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1dc1c73163416326a15eb1c3f70983e","title":"england sam curran high price ipl cricket auction","story":"Sam Curran has been confirmed as one of 18 English players who will feature in next week’s Indian Premier League auction, with the Surrey all-rounder expected to be in high demand after a breakout year in international cricket.The home World Cup in 2019 reduces the availability of England’s one-day players to the first four weeks of the IPL that starts on 29 March, meaning a number of the more established names may go unsold in Jaipur next Tuesday.Indeed, Eoin Morgan and Joe Root, who both went unsold last year, have not entered the process at all, as the two England captains look to focus on a jam-packed year that also includes an Ashes campaign for the latter.But Curran, who shot to prominence during the summer’s 4-1 Test series win over India, is expected to be free for the entire Twenty20 tournament, with his omission from the one-day squad to tour the Caribbean suggesting he is not currently in England’s World Cup plans.While the 20-year-old has set himself at the highest base price of £220,000, a number of franchises including Royal Challengers Bangalore –the team captained by India’s Virat Kohli – are known to have been impressed by his all-round talents.Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler were retained by Rajasthan Royals, as was David Willey at Chennai Superkings and Moeen Ali at RCB. But Alex Hales, Chris Woakes and Mark Wood were released by their respective sides and, along with the previously unsold Jonny Bairstow, will hope a lack of availability does not count against them this time.England’s World Cup preparations begin with a one-off ODI against Ireland in Dublin on 3 May and all squad members must report back by 25 April. Tom Curran and Liam Plunkett, who played in this year’s IPL but were also set free, have decided to start the English summer at Surrey. Adil Rashid has also opted out.Joe Denly, who was named in England’s ODI squad to face West Indies at the expense of Liam Dawson, is another to put his name forward. Out of the county hopefuls, a name to look out for when the bidding gets under way will be Pat Brown, of Worcestershire.The 20-year-old right-arm seamer, who possesses a deceptive knuckle-ball, finished up leading wicket-taker as the Rapids won this year’s T20 Blast under the captaincy of Moeen with a base price of just £40,000, he could well attract interest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/313903369d00ceb28d67373e6aad46b463df7fe2/0_0_4212_2526/master/4212.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e630e5b24f9f2fb0a5d1563b7454ed15","title":"olympian jess varnish accuses british cycling of extreme control employment tribunal","story":"Employment tribunal hears athlete allege she was punished for minor transgressionsThe Olympic cyclist Jess Varnish has accused British Cycling of exercising “extreme control” over her and other athletes in her long-running legal attempt to sue the organisation for sex discrimination and unfair dismissal.In order to bring her discrimination claim, Varnish, 28, must first prove that she was an employee of either British Cycling, which didn’t pay her but had supported her training since she was 12, or UK Sport, which from 2015 provided her with a £21,500 tax-free grant towards her living and training costs.She fell out publicly with British Cycling in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics in Rio, when she was kicked off the podium programme for top athletes. She had failed to qualify for her sprint event at the Olympics and her coaches decided she was unlikely to win a medal at Rio.Varnish then gave a media interview claiming one of her coaches, Shane Sutton, had told her she was “too old” and should leave and “have a baby”. Sutton subsequently said: “I’m adamant that I am innocent. I have definitely never overstepped the mark.” He did however accept he had told her to lose some “timber”.It says that the “athlete performance award” received by Varnish was “akin to grants offered in the past by local authorities to help students pay for their living costs while studying for degrees”.In documents submitted to an employment tribunal in Manchester on Tuesday, Varnish argued that she was an employee because of the “net of control” extended over her and other athletes by British Cycling, alleging it punished them for minor transgressions, and told them what to wear, eat and say in public.She had to wear Team GB kit even when arriving at the velodrome for training, leaving “very limited opportunity for self expression”, she claimed, and had to relinquish her own image rights to British Cycling. She said she was “obliged” to complete media appearances and volunteer days for both British Cycling and UK Sport, where athletes “were told what to say or what to avoid”.She described being punished after turning up 10 minutes late to her first training session with her “idols” Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, when she was still a teenager. Her coach, Iain Dyer, made her “ride around the velodrome for 30 laps as punishment for being late. He made me stick out like a sore thumb when everyone else was just warming up.” She complained: “Non-compliance with the rules was just not tolerated for any reason whatsoever.”Varnish said British Cycling even owned her blood samples – “this is an example of the extreme control exercised over the lives of cyclists.” She also had to submit to monthly skin fold tests to check how much fat she had put on, and had to take pictures of her food via an app to send to her coaches. She also described cyclists regularly training until they vomited and being forced to train when her hands were bleeding and blistered after lifting 180kg weights.She said she was “completely” supported by British Cycling and UK Sport: “I received top quality medical care, dentistry, psychological support … I think UK Sport estimate that this is worth about £23,000 to £40,000.”Varnish joined British Cycling’s talent programme aged 12 and moved up the ranks until 2010, when she joined the podium programme, reserved for elite cyclists with a chance of winning a medal at either a world championship or Olympics. When she first moved to Manchester to train as a teenager she was given £7,500 a year from UK Sport. She lived in a flat rented by British Cycling and paid £250 in rent.She told the tribunal that she missed out on lucrative sponsorship agreements with Virgin Trains and the clothing company Sweaty Betty because they were vetoed by British Cycling.But under cross-examination by Thomas Linden, QC, representing British Cycling, Varnish accepted she had set up a business in 2010 “for tax purposes” through which her sponsorship deals could be processed.The tribunal heard that in June 2011 she signed a three-year deal with Boots that promised to pay her £32,500 in the first 18 months and then a further £50,000. To earn the money she had to commit to nine eight-hour days promoting Boots each year, Linden told the tribunal. If she won medals in 2012-2014 she would receive bonuses of £5,000 a time, he added.Varnish, asked why she hadn’t declared either the business or a sponsorship deal with Boots in her witness statement, said: “I wrote the witness statement about the level of control. Because that’s what it was about.”Linden put it to her that she was able to enter into the Boots deal because she knew Dyer would not object. “I could sign it whether it would be disapproved of or not,” she accepted. Linden said Dyer, who was due to give evidence to the tribunal, had been “very sympathetic to requests from athletes for sponsorship opportunities because he understood the need for athletes to earn from other sources.”She also had a deal to get a free car from Nissan, a British Olympic Federation partner, and had a commercial agreement with Adidas, the tribunal heard.Evidence was also expected to be heard from witnesses including Varnish’s partner, the former BMX world champion Liam Phillips, and Dr Richard Freeman, the former British Cycling team doctor who was embroiled in the Bradley Wiggin’s jiffy bag scandal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a389e4a1674863bcdc127f7dfbc1a192b65769e5/3_70_3685_2211/master/3685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e278658070ae4acce56a13e5b04a61dd","title":"premiership rugby hopes to finalise cvc deal by christmas","story":"Premiership Rugby hopes to conclude a £230m agreement with a private equity firm before Christmas after a board meeting on Tuesday failed to tie up a few loose ends.“There remains unanimity about our approach and our desire to enter into a requirement for a significant investment which we think will herald a new era for the league,” said the Premiership Rugby chairman, Ian Ritchie. “We remain on track in achieving our objectives but nothing has yet been concluded.“These discussions are inevitably complex and take whatever time is necessary.

They were reassured the lump sum they receive will be a windfall with proceeds from sponsorship and broadcasting deals expected to rise significantly if CVC gets involved.CVC, which used to own Formula One, would have no say in the running of the league but would lead its commercial arm. “We are not there yet because discussions like this one are not straightforward,” said the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Mark McCafferty. “It is a question of time rather than principle and we would like to resolve this before Christmas.“It always comes down to a few issues and we will work through them. Nothing is done until it’s done and it will not drag on. With the collective will around the table today, we can find the answers to those items.

Amy Heckerling’s 1995 comedy, a clever update of Jane Austen’s Emma, buzzes around a high school queen bee. This adaptation, also superintended by Heckerling, is all drone.Produced by the New Group and directed by Kristin Hanggi, the story still revolves around Cher (played here by Dove Cameron, a Disney Channel star with the eyes of a startled forest creature). Living in Beverly Hills splendor with her litigator dad and an artfully curated closet, Cher passes her days interfering with the lives of her classmates and sparring with her ex-stepbrother, Josh (Dave Thomas Brown, an actor who occasionally makes you forget Paul Rudd – high praise). When a new girl, Tai (Ephie Aardema), arrives at school, Cher and her friend Dionne (Zurin Villanueva) try to make her popular. With mediocre results.Clueless joins a recent fad for musicals made from ’90s teen flicks. There was Heathers, which boasted an original score, and Cruel Intentions, which upped its camp factor by adding I Saw the Sign and I’ll Make Love to You. (Can an American Pie operetta be far behind?) Mean Girls, an artifact from the ’00s, is cleaning up on Broadway.It would be easy, then, to see Clueless in a cynical light, as another attempt to cash in on younger Gen Xolder millennial nostalgia. But Heckerling has always believed that Clueless should be a musical. With its candy colors and peppy rhythms, the original practically qualified. Unfortunately, the road to dull is paved with Heckerling’s good intentions and her iffy follow through. She hasn’t really rethought the movie for the stage. She has kept the dialogue and structure more or less intact there are still so many scenes set in cars. Movie fans will hear all of their favorite lines– “As if!” “Way harsh!” “You’re a virgin who can’t drive” – and see most of their favorite outfits.Heckerling is a stage virgin. Can she drive? Not really. Attempts to situate the action in the music are miss and hit. With so many scenes imported from the movie, most songs have nothing to do and despite Kelly Devine’s cheerful and lively choreography, which quotes from ’90s dance moves, nowhere to go.Then there are the songs themselves. Instead of hiring a composer and lyricist, Heckerling cherry-picked a bunch of ’90s songs – some from the original soundtrack, some not – and rewritten the lyrics. Her great and nifty gift for dialogue does not translate. No Scrubs becomes a song about shrunken sweaters: No Shrugs. Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn gets a line about maple-glazed popcorn that doesn’t even scan. Here’s Josh re-interpreting What If God Was One of Us: “What if Cher didn’t have a trust Just a slob like all of us.”The cast is enthusiastic. Will Connolly as stoner Travis and Megan Sikora as a couple of teachers are especially fine. But like the recent Pretty Woman or to a lesser extent School of Rock, this is another show that seems diminished without its original star. Alicia Silverstone, the movie’s Cher, was so effortlessly likable and so sweet in her scheming, she neatly dodged any dumb blonde stereotypes. It was impossible not to love her. Cameron is charming, but she lacks that ridiculous magnetism, which makes her smarts an open question and her stakes awfully low. Will Cher acquire remedial self-knowledge? Will she pass her driving test? Will she ever wear a skirt that falls below mid-thigh? Does any of it matter?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92be7527a2f60d634d3a16e47a11aa7241218c5c/0_0_4216_2530/master/4216.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9b16e6e3acef34fcbe263c0854144c0","title":"apple 129in ipad pro review bringing back the wow factor","story":"Dumping the home button for Face ID allows an impressive all-screen design but makes for an extremely expensive tabletAfter eight years of fairly boring design revisions, the new 2018 iPad Pro finally breaks the mould, restoring the wow factor the original commanded way back in 2010.That’s because the new iPad Pro is practically all screen. The home button is gone, replaced with uniform bezels around the edges and a thin, squared-off aluminium body reminiscent of the iPhone 4’s gorgeous design.Fire up the screen and you are greeted with a beautiful display that is arguably the best LCD on any device, let alone a tablet. The question is whether you share Apple’s vision of what the next version of a computer should be and whether a large screen running a mobile operating system cuts the mustard.There are two starting with a slightly bigger 11in iPad Pro but it is the 12.9in version that is the most impressive and the one reviewed here. Where the previous 12.9in was fairly heavy and unwieldy, the shrinking of the body around the large screen has made it feel a lot smaller and easier to handle.The new tablet is a noticeable 49g lighter, 1mm thinner, 19.4mm shorter and 5.1mm narrower than its predecessor. At 631g and only 5.9mm in thickness the 12.9in iPad Pro is thinner and lighter than most of its productivity tablet competition, too. The 12.3in Microsoft Surface Pro weighs 770g and is 8.5mm thick, while Google’s 12.3in Pixel Slate is 726g and 7mm thick.The four speakers in the sides are loud and clear, putting most other tablets to shame. The industry-standard USB-C port replaces the old Lightning socket for power and connectivity. The new Apple Pencil magnetically attaches to and wirelessly charges from one side of the tablet, while the smart connector has been moved to the smooth aluminium back of the tablet.Apple says the 2018 iPad Pro is more powerful than the majority of mobile PCs sold in the last year, and I can well believe that, but I found it difficult to find any apps that actually use all that power.Affinity Photo was super-smooth even in complex image manipulation tasks and games were fluid but neither felt blisteringly faster than the previous iPad Pro.If you can get all your work done on an iPad Pro it will far outlast any Intel-powered laptop, let alone a tablet, but it takes 3.5 hours to fully charge using the included folding 18W USB-C charger when not in use. It will charge faster from a more powerful USB-C laptop charger.Apple’s Face ID recognition system replaces the Touch ID fingerprint sensor, squeezed into the bezel on the left edge. It works very well, despite the wider variety of angles you hold a tablet at compared to a smartphone.Only occasionally did I have to intentionally lean over the tablet to get it to see my face, or move my hand from blocking the camera when held in landscape. It feels far more natural than reaching for a fingerprint scanner on a tablet.If docked in the Smart Keyboard you can simply double tap the spacebar or any key to unlock and dismiss the lock screen taking a leaf out of Microsoft’s excellent Windows Hello system.The iPad Pro runs the same version of iOS as previous iPads and iPhones, with its large selection of third-party tablet apps, including great text editors and art programs, plus every media consumption app you could want. Digital comics look particularly good on the big, bright and brilliant screen.The side-by-side split-screen apps work well on the 12.9in screen, which is big enough to stay productive with half the screen per app. But when it comes to genuine productivity, iOS is often the thing holding the iPad Pro back.You can’t access removable storage, apart from to import photos. You can hook up a monitor but only use it beyond simple mirroring with certain functions such as presentations. There are many of these little irritations that aren’t a problem on macOS or Windows 10.The iPad Pro can do most things you would on Mac or a PC but you might need a hack or workaround. Fewer of these tricks are needed each year but one thing that hasn’t improved is Safari.It is a very good mobile browser but it isn’t desktop class. That’s fine for most things but trying to use a complex web app, the kind often needed when getting work done such as a content management system or similar, can be like pulling teeth.Perhaps the web app should be better designed but when it is primarily used in desktop-class browsers with mousing and multi-click support, the reality is that the tablet has to be able to handle the app a rather than the other way around. Particularly if it wants to be your only computer.Apple’s gesture navigation is second to none. All your favourites from the iPhone X are there. A short swipe up from the bottom reveals the dock, from which you can grab an app and go split screen. Swipe up further to reach the home screen, or swipe up and hold to go to the task switcher. Switch between apps by swiping across the gesture bar at the bottom.The classic iPad pinching gestures are still there, too. Pinch with four or more fingers to go straight to the task switcher. Swipe up with four or more fingers to go home, or left and right to switch to the next app.They are all incredibly smooth, feeling natural and intuitive for an all-screen device.Apple offers a new Pencil stylus costing £119, as the old Pencil is not compatible with the new iPad Pro. Gone is the daft-looking Lightning connector that you plugged directly into the iPad. It is replaced by magnets to attach it to the top of the tablet and wirelessly charge it - ready for action when you need it.It stayed mounted fairly well but can be knocked off easily when pulling the iPad out of a bag unless you’re careful.Double tap the barrel of the Pencil with your finger to switch between drawing and erasing, or similar. It’s app dependent, so your favourite app might not yet support it, but it works well in Apple Notes. It’s not quite as good as a button but it’s better than nothing.While the iPad Pro can be used with just about any Bluetooth keyboard, Apple sells a £199 Smart Keyboard Folio for the new iPad Pro, which acts like a case and clips the tablet and smart connector via magnets.It costs a lot but worked very well. I could instantly touch type on what feels very much like the keyboards on the current generation of Apple laptops.It’s sealed, so no debris is going to get under the keys, and it holds the tablet securely at one of two angles. It works great on a desk and is OK on a lap, feeling more stable than the previous generation of Apple Smart Keyboard.The iPad Pro comes in two screen sizes, four storage options and two variants with and without 4G connectivity.The wifi-only 11in iPad Pro costs £769 with 64GB of storage, £919 with 256GB, £1,119 for 512GB and £1,519 for 1TB. It costs £150 to add 4G to any of the storage versions.The wifi-only 12.9in iPad Pro costs £969 with 64GB of storage, £1,119 with 256GB, £1,319 for 512GB and £1,719 for 1TB. It costs £150 to add 4G capability to any of the storage versions, which is especially useful for working on the go, but requires another mobile broadband subscription.The Apple Pencil costs £119 and the Smart Keyboard Folio costs £179 for the 11in iPad Pro and £199 for the 12.9in iPad Pro.The new 12.9in iPad Pro is a remarkable piece of technology that rekindles that wow factor for me that most technology has lost. But it is exceedingly expensive if it is considered just a tablet.Apple claims the iPad is the evolution of the computer, and you can certainly get work done on it for double the length of time between charges than its competitors.But because of the intentional limitations of iOS, to get work done you need to make adjustments and use little hacks and workarounds you simply don’t have to on a desktop operating system. And really for something that costs upward of £969 it should adapt to you rather than the other way around.Yes, the iPad Pro is a computer but it’s not the best computer. It is the best, most desirable mobile tablet, and you’ll want one if you see one. But when the 9.7in iPad costs just £319 and works great for watching video, whether you should spend £769 for the 11in or £969 for the 12.9in version really comes down to how much you’re willing to spend on a luxury item. Because that’s what the iPad Pro is: a beautiful, luxury piece of kit.Pros: brilliant screen, long battery life, optional 4G, lots of tablet apps, USB-C, good speakers, Face ID, industry-leading gesturesCons: very expensive, iOS limitations, no kickstand without case, can’t fully replace a computer for everything This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The two streets are under an hour’s drive from each other.“This research lays bare the extent of the UK’s digital ide,” said Dani Warner, a broadband expert at uSwitch. “Streets that are relatively close geographically can be light years apart when it comes to the download speeds they are getting.”The report noted geographic trends. Nine of the streets with the slowest broadband were in North and South Yorkshire, Teeside, Manchester and across Scotland. Five of the streets with the fastest broadband were in south-west England.“Awareness continues to be the biggest hurdle to people getting faster download speeds,” said Warner. “On more than a third of the slowest streets people have no need to be crawling along on completely unusable internet services.”Ofcom says there are about 1.1 million “forgotten homes” that cannot access the ideal minimum speed of 10Mbps.The government has promised all homes and businesses will have a legal right to demand access to services offering speeds of at least 10Mbps by 2020. Broadband providers will face a legal requirement to provide this minimum standard to anyone requesting it, subject to a cost threshold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aa33d84b9b0c170a07eb570cee0be5a6fc71a42/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18a1d8f481fa465fb11200c4971892ab","title":"share your best travel discovery of 2018 for the chance of winning a 200 hotel voucher","story":"Did you find somewhere really fabulous on your travels this year?

But to say that a child must do less homework in order to have more free time seems extravagant to me.”Giovanni Lo Storto, the director general of Rome’s LUISS University, said the level of homework given to children varied from school to school.“Bussetti makes an interesting point, but it also shines a light on equilibrium,” Lo Storto told the . “If children have to do too much work at home, it might mean they are doing less work at school.”Bussetti’s comments are in line with the Italian government’s focus on preserving traditional family values.In September, Luigi Di Maio, the deputy prime minister and leader of the Five Star Movement, the League’s coalition partner, said measures would be introduced to limit Sunday trading because liberal opening hours had “destroyed Italian families”.The government has also included a proposal in its draft budget for 2019 to reward parents who have a third child with free farmland, in an attempt to increase Italy’s low birthrate.Last month, Bussetti said he backed a suggestion for crucifixes to be hung up in all schools and for nativity scenes to be installed in the run-up to Christmas, arguing that both symbols were part of Italian “identity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/764d59ea896017710fda4433d8a429e61911123a/0_150_4512_2707/master/4512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ae5be2e666d0a497540c933e25b6eb5","title":"macron president of the rich speech elysee palace gilets jaunes","story":"Flaunting Élysée Palace’s gilded rooms does little to quell ‘president of the rich’ tagIt was the most important TV appearance of Emmanuel Macron’s presidency: the 40-year-old former banker had to prove to an angry nation that he was not an arrogant “president of the rich” and that he understood ordinary French people’s struggle to make ends meet.Yet Macron’s choice to deliver his prerecorded speech on social inequality from one of the most opulent and golden rooms in the luxurious, 365-room Élysée Palace was not lost on gilets jaunes protesters who have been occupying protest barricades on rural roundabouts.Indeed, the Élysée Palace, the French presidential residence and workplace that is twice the size of the US White House and costs €104m a year to run, has been the object of fury during the protests. The demonstrations, which began as a citizens’ revolt against a proposed fuel tax on 17 November have quickly morphed into wider anti-government demonstrations against inequality.On the barricades, many have been critical of the Macrons for redecorating some rooms in the palace – including the main reception room where new carpets will cost €300,000 (£271,000). Macron chose to announce his measures aimed at calming the gilets jaunes protests by speaking from the traditional presidential office known as the salon doré, with its gold decorations.He sat behind the large antique desk that has been used by all presidents since Charles de Gaulle and is the most valuable piece of furniture in the gilded palace. At the edge of the frame was a golden cockerel, the symbol of France, between golden lamps, and three carefully placed antique books. Behind him, just to the right of a pair of ornate gold leaf doors, were the French and European flags.The 13-minute address had to prove the pro-business Macron understood the “real world” of protesters. There had been outrage among gilets jaunes when an MP from Macron’s party, La République En Marche, was recently unable to state the minimum wage on TV or when a cabinet minister trying to show the gulf between the working poor and the political elite appeared to complain that Paris dinners cost “€200 without wine”.Macron’s every twitch and movement was scrutinised by viewers. Some wondered if he had a rash on his neck, perhaps from stress. Others felt the way he sat with hands on the table looked a bit like a school teacher returning homework. But a record 23 million people tuned in – about the same number as for the French football team’s winning World Cup final.Macron usually prefers to make TV addresses from his everyday office next door, which features vast works of modern art, including a copy of American street artist Shepard Fairey’s portrait of the Marianne symbol of the French republic. But Macron has said he likes to work in the golden presidential office when he has to focus on things that are more “complex” and require “time and order”. It is also where he meets global leaders such as Donald Trump.“He doesn’t live in the real world” is a common refrain on the barricades, where Macron is likened to a monarch. It remains to be seen whether an appearance from a gilded room in an 18th-century palace will change people’s minds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d5e5a45d24c5eb2172eda7b95e828b07ae0d60d/219_0_3281_1970/master/3281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bccb3a1233aa4ec624e76dbe73af62c1","title":"chocolate factory leak smothers german street paving","story":"Tonne of chocolate flows out of factory in Westoennen, coating the pavementA street in a western German town got a repaving worthy of Willy Wonka when a tonne of chocolate flowed out of a factory and solidified on the pavement.The German newspaper Soester Anzeiger reported that a “small technical defect” involving a storage tank caused the chocolate to spill out from the DreiMeister chocolate factory in Westoennen.After hitting the chilly pavement, the milk chocolate quickly hardened.About 25 firefighters worked to pry the chocolate off with shovels.

He urged people to visit Myanmar and to experience the “amazing food” and people who were “full of joy”.Responding to those who had criticised him for not mentioning the violent crackdown against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine state, which a UN official described this year as an “ongoing” genocide, Dorsey said that was a “purely personal trip for me focused on only one dimension: meditation practice”.He added: “I’m aware of the human rights atrocities and suffering in Myanmar. I don’t view visiting, practicing, or talking with the people, as endorsement. I didn’t intend to diminish by not raising the issue, but could have acknowledged that I don’t know enough and need to learn more.”Dorsey said he had “no conversations with government or NGOs” during his trip and emphasised he had travelled to Myanmar as a devotee of vipassana meditation practice, which is still practised its original form in Myanmar.“I took this time with a singular objective of working on myself,” he added. “I shared my experience with the world with the singular objective of encouraging others to consider a similar practice. Simply because it’s the best thing I’ve found to help me every day.”In August 2017, a military-led crackdown against the Rohingya saw thousands killed, villages razed to the ground and women raped and assaulted. More than 700,000 people were driven over the border to Bangladesh to seek safety.A UN fact-finding mission recently concluded that the military had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Rakhine and had “genocidal intent” in the actions against the Rohingya.

A third-party committee said the university’s explanation was unacceptable.Kitasato university admitted on its website that it had also prioritised male candidates.Revelations this summer that Tokyo Medical University had deliberately altered entrance exam scores for more than a decade caused an outcry in Japan and fuelled suspicions that other institutions operated a similarly discriminatory admissions policy.The Tokyo medical school rigged the scores of a large number of women, arguing that female doctors tend to quit the profession when they start families, creating staff shortages at already overstretched clinics and hospitals.Two women who sat the entrance exam in recent years told the  they felt “betrayed” when they learned they might be among those whose scores had been manipulated.In October, 24 women demanded that the school pay them 100,000 yen (£700) each in damages for “emotional distress”, along with their exam fees and travel expenses.In the wake of the Tokyo medical school revelations the education ministry launched an investigation into 81 other universities with medical faculties.Statistics from recent entrance exams at Juntendo highlight the obstacles placed in the way of female candidates.Its medical school has rejected 165 applicants – including 121 women – over the past two years, even though they had performed satisfactorily in at least the first part of the two-part entrance exam. Men were 1.67 times more likely to pass than women.The gap between the ratio of successful male and female candidates was higher at Juntendo than at any of the other surveyed institutions, the Mainichi newspaper said.Initially Juntendo and other universities insisted they had not set out to discriminate against women, and did not concede their admissions policy was problematic until it was pointed out by independent investigators.“We have never been involved in illicit practices such as backdoor admissions or discrimination against women, but we’ve made some adjustments (to exam scores) between male and female applicants,” the Mainichi quoted a source close to the university as saying in October.This week, however, the university’s president, Hajime Arai, apologised to the unfairly rejected candidates. “At that time, we judged that the measure was reasonable at our university’s discretion,” he, said, according to the Asahi. “We will end the practice now that it has been pointed out that it was inappropriate.”The scandal is the latest setback to Japanese government attempts to raise the profile of working women, particularly in senior positions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3728173.1544561912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"legionella bacteria found in dublin city offices","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWater tests in September found traces of legionella in one water system in the men’s toilets in the basement of the rates office, a Georgian building opposite City Hall on Dame Street. Dublin city’s rates office has been closed down and its staff moved following the discovery of the bacteria which causes legionnaires’ disease in its water system.Annual water tests carried out by Dublin City Council in September found traces of legionella in one water system in the men’s toilets in the basement of the rates office, a Georgian building opposite City Hall on Dame Street.The bacteria can cause legionnaires’ disease which can be fatal and is particularly serious for older people, those who are immuno-compromised, and for heavy smokers. The area was closed to staff, but follow-up tests carried out in October identified further traces of legionella in “a number of water outlets” throughout the building, the council said.On November 1st, the council decided to shut down the building and relocate its staff. Most staff, a total of 30, were moved to the Civic Offices on Wood Quay, with a number of rate collectors working from home.No staff contracted legionella, the council said. While the public had been able to access the building, there was “no access to the toilets in the building to the general public”, it said. Rates are now paid at the customer service centre in the Civic Offices.However, Independent councillor Mannix Flynn said the council should have made an immediate public announcement of the finding, due to the seriousness of the disease.“They should have issued a statement straight away – this is the water system of a public building, where a bacteria was found that causes a very serious disease.”The council said work was under way to determine the source of the legionella and remedial work would be carried out on the building in due course.Legionnaires’ disease is a type of pneumonia that usually starts with flu-like symptoms, including fever, tiredness, headache and muscle pains.These are followed by a dry cough and breathing difficulties, which may progress to a severe pneumonia. The disease is spread through the air from a water source. People become infected when they breathe in tiny droplets of water contaminated with legionella bacteria.It causes death in about 7.5 per cent of cases, but most cases can be treated successfully with antibiotics.According to statistics provided by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, the rate of legionnaires’ disease is much lower in Ireland than the European average, occurring in approximately 3.8 people out of every million in Ireland, compared to 11.2 cases per million of population in Europe."},{"url":null,"title":"charity prints from the irish times","story":" photographers have produced a gallery of images that will make a unique Christmas gift.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

Once, that material filled the entire universe, scientists think – during the first few microseconds after the Big Bang, before there were atoms.The researchers found they were able to generate droplets of that strange matter, and it expanded to form into three separate geometric patterns.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialCreated with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.118 Baby mice tears could be used in pest controlA study from the University of Tokyo has found that the tears of baby mice cause female mice to be less interested in the sexual advances of males218 Final warning to limit climate catastropheThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued a report which projects the impact of a rise in global temperatures of 1.5 degrees Celsius and warns against a higher increase318 Nobel prize for evolution chemistsThe nobel prize for chemistry has been awarded to three chemists working with evolution.

Used for conditions such as myopia and cataracts.Our experimental result has brought us much closer to answering the question of what is the smallest amount of early universe matter that can exist, said Jamie Nagle\u0026nbspfrom the University of Colorado at Boulder, one of the many researchers who contributed towards the experiment.The cosmic mystery that remains at the heart of our universeScientists first began research on this strange matter in 2000, when they smashed pieces of gold atoms together and threw out temperatures that were trillions of degrees Celsius. In the incredibly hot soup that it generated, the particles that make up all protons and neutrons broke apart and began to flow, suggesting that generating the new kinds of matter would be possible.Researchers developed that technique so that they could be made more precisely, generating the quark gluon plasma by smashing together only two protons – something that scientists didn\u0027t think was possible.They found that if you expanded those experiments you could push the droplets into each other, which formed exactly the kinds of unusual shapes that scientists were predicting.Imagine that you have two droplets that are expanding into a vacuum, said Nagle.\u0026nbspIf the two droplets are really close together, then as they\u0027re expanding out, they run into each other and push against each other, and that\u0027s what creates this pattern.Scientists hope to use the findings to explore how the quark gluon plasma – when it first arrived, in the earliest miliseconds of the universe – quickly cooled and became the first atoms ever to exist.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Crucially, he knew when to fall silent.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBut he also had an acute sense of fun. Occasionally permitting\u0026nbsphimself a dry chuckle – as when the alarm sounded on his digital watch and a panellist quipped it must be his bedtime – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas able to lay down the law when it mattered, evicting a heckler just last year after they began barracking Remain campaigner Gina Miller.Other celebrated encounters he oversaw during his tenure included Ian\u0026nbspHislop\u0026nbsptackling Mary Archer over her husband’s part in dragging the\u0026nbspConservative Party through the mud, Nigel Farage at daggers drawn with Eddie Izzard over immigration\u0026nbspand Eric Pickles facing a hostile crowd during the expenses scandal.Fiona Bruce confirmed as new Question Time hostThroughout, he remained the model professional.“Dimbleby has become virtually inscrutable,” Ben\u0026nbspSummerskill\u0026nbspwrote in The Observer in 2001. “Even his closest colleagues say they find it almost impossible to ine who he might vote for.”Equally adept interviewing John Lydon\u0026nbspas he was John Prescott, Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas on superb form in 2009 when BNP leader Nick Griffin was invited on to Question Time, a matter of huge controversy. The presenter handled the occasion by simply putting his questions forward and allowing the man’s absurdity to speak for itself.Asking the far-right politician about Holocaust denial, he pressed him:\u0026nbsp“Why are you smiling? It’s not a particularly amusing issue.”That same year, Dimbleby\u0026nbspmissed a show for the first time in his career when he was briefly knocked unconscious by a rearing bullock he was attempting to load into a trailer on his Sussex farm. John Humphrys stepped in to the hot seat.In addition to Question Time, Dimbleby has taken part in every BBC general election broadcast since 1979, his famous calm\u0026nbsptested in 1987 when Robin Day unexpectedly threw him a link and caught him out live on camera with a mouthful of Mars Bar. He rowed back on his retirement in 2017 to bump the unlucky Huw Edwards from the desk, apparently unable to resist the excitement of one last ride.\u0026nbspHe has also regularly hosted the BBC’s coverage of America’s presidential elections, memorably sparring with Gore Vidal during the Obama-McCain race of 2008, amused and genial while the writer was on cantankerous form, pretending not to know who he was and asking:\u0026nbsp“May I talk the facts of life to you?”The BBC has made good use of his gravitas for great occasions of state, inviting him to provide the commentary for Remembrance Sunday, the funerals of Princess Diana, the Queen Mother and Margaret Thatcher, New Year’s Eve 1999, Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee in 2002 and the Brexit referendum of 2016.“The British people have spoken – we are out,”\u0026nbsphe concluded that night,\u0026nbspeffectively firing\u0026nbspthe starting pistol on the madcap bureaucratic chaos that has since ensued.Like his father Richard during the Second World War and its aftermath, David Dimbleby found himself providing the public face of the corporation, and uniquely suited to it. He might\u0026nbsp have equally become an MP, his privileged upbringing leading him to study politics, philosophy and economics at Christ Church, Oxford, the usual route to the hustings.Dimbleby\u0026nbsphas also developed a nice sideline in national heritage documentaries, fronting A Picture of Britain (2005), How We Built Britain (2007) and Britain and the Sea (2013) and\u0026nbspbeen tipped as a potential director-general or chairman of the BBC at various stages without ever quite making the leap.It’s Question Time though with which he is indelibly associated.\u0026nbspLoved for his deafening ties – electric pink is all in a day’s work – Dimbleby\u0026nbspwas always extremely game when it came to promoting the show on Facebook, wiggling his hips to “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones and even performing a Brexit rap: “We’ve triggered Article 50May’s letter was niftyMichel Barnier looks shiftyAre we going to have to be thriftyWith a recession in 2050?”This underrated side of his character perhaps explains the Dimblebot.\u0026nbspA spoof mechanoid alter ego offering a droll running commentary on Question Time via Twitter since 2009, the Dimblebot\u0026nbsptweets in block capitals to his “DIMBLETS” every week, hailing the work of “BIO-DIMBLEBY” as the real presenter\u0026nbsp“DEFEATS” his guests and members of the audience in debate.Adored online for his “DIMBLE-DANCE” and Teletext-style website, it is rumoured that members of the extended Dimbleby\u0026nbspclan buy each other merchandise from the site for Christmas, so delighted are they by the send-up of the patriarch.When Prescott raised the Dimblebot\u0026nbspwith the host and his unlikely online celebrity live on air in 2011, he responded with a laugh:\u0026nbsp“We’re having a serious discussion here but I do know I’m called ‘Dimblebot’ and I know there’s a Dimble-dance and I can do it, too… But this is neither the time nor the place!”Whether the creators are assembling a BRUCEBOT to succeed the decommissioned avatar of\u0026nbspBIO-DIMBLEBY\u0026nbspis as yet unknown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Earlier this year, Samsung released another advert making fun of the design, featuring the same man now carrying a child with a similarly unconventional hairdo.With the release date for the Galaxy S10\u0026nbspanticipated for early 2019, the trickle of leaks and rumours surrounding the highly-anticipated device is turning into a stream, with the latest potentially revealing how the South Korean tech giant will negate the notch.Notorious leaker Evan Blass\u0026nbspshared designs of what a case manufacturer expected of the Galaxy S10, which featured three models for the lineup.As expected from previous leaks, the single lens devices have a hole in the screen to cater for the camera.The S10+ model, which will feature two lenses, makes use of two separate holes at the top centre of\u0026nbspthe screen in order to avoid the notch design.In a follow-up tweet, Mr Blass said: Usually I\u0027m a big fan of symmetry, but in this case, I hope the cutouts are offset from center as in the examples shown off at SDC.EDELSONAFPGetty Images)Other rumours surrounding the Samsung Galaxy S10\u0026nbspinclude a self-healing screen that could potentially put an end to scratched displays.A patent for a screen containing a self-healing property was revealed earlier this year, which described how such technology could be used in a portable electronic device such as a smart phone or tablet.The Galaxy S10\u0026nbspis set to launch on the 10th anniversary of Samsung\u0027s first flagship smartphone but it isn\u0027t the only high-end phone it plans to release next year.A foldable phone was unveiled in Ocober\u0026nbspat the firm\u0027s developer conference, with Samsung describing it as the foundation of the smartphone of tomorrow.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our updated approach means the public will be better able to make informed choices about CAM charities and whether they wish to support them or use their services.”He added: “Our review was not about whether CAM is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ or should be made available through public health provision – that is a matter for others. And nor do we expect our outcome necessarily to please all those with strong views about CAM generally. Our focus is on the integrity of the register of charities. We know the public place value on the concept of charity, and we must ensure that the register of charities is accurate and that only organisations that are, in law, charities are registered as such.”In the Charity Commission’s response to the consultation on CAM status, the organisation wrote: “Registration of a charity is acceptance that the organisation meets the legal test for being a charity, including that it is established for exclusively charitable purposes for the public benefit. Public benefit is based on evidence. In registering a CAM organisation as a charity we are not endorsing any treatment or confirming its efficacy but confirming that the organisation meets the test for charitable status including that of benefit to the public.”There is no universally agreed definition of what constitutes a CAM, and practices such as massage, acupuncture, tai chi, and drinking green tea may all be considered as such.NHS stops funding homeopathy at major alternative medicine hospitalThe British Homeopathic Association (BHA), a charity which aims to encourage and enable patient access to homeopathic remedies, appears not to be concerned about the results of the review.Cristal Sumner, chief executive of the BHA, told The Independent: “As a patient focused charity we are pleased to see the emphasis of the Charity Commission’s long-awaited outcome report is about ensuring that CAM organisations are subject to the same governance and legal requirements as other charities on the register.“The BHA was established in 1902 and our charitable status is not only a fundamental part of our identity, it also means that members of the public can have confidence that we are meeting the public benefit and legal requirements set by our governing body.”Homeopathic treatments are separate from science-based western medicine, and are based on ideas developed by German doctor Samuel Hahnemann in the 1790s\u0026nbspand early 1800s.Hahnemann’s key principles are based on theories that a substance which causes particular symptoms can also be used to take away those symptoms. This is usually done through a process of dilution and shaking\u0026nbspcalled “succession”. Remedies may often therefore be made from a substance that has been repeatedly diluted with water, until there is almost none, or absolutely none of the original substance remaining.Created with Sketch.NHS at 70: Pride and worry as free health service celebrates birthday Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalNurses test the hearing of a newborn childThe waiting room is busy in Milton Keynes University HospitalOn Ward 24, two nurses work at the nurses stationIn A\u0026ampE, a porter rushes a patient through the corridorA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationIn the physiotherapy department, patients are treated in the hydrotherapy poolIn the physiotherapy department, amputees take a classA junior doctor is at work in the staff roomA surgical team prepares a patient for their operationAn inpatient has her hair washed by the staff hairdressersIn the audiology department, a mother watches on as her son is given a hearing testOn Ward 8, staff serve lunch to the patientsOn Ward 24, a patient waits on their bedOn Ward 8, a cleaner is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalCommon ailments homeopathy is said to “treat”, include a broad spectrum of physical and psychological conditions including bruises, toothaches, nausea, coughs and colds, asthma and depression.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Does it really mean a recession is likely? How concerned should we really be?They are, effectively, the rates of annual interest paid out to investors by bonds.The yield on short-term US government bonds is normally well below the yield on equivalent long-term bonds, reflecting the simple fact that people will generally want a larger return if they are going to lock their cash away for longer.This results in an upward sloping “curve”, with bond yields gently rising as the redemption date of the bond stretches into the future.Sometimes the yield on short-term bonds rises, bringing short-term borrowing rates close to long-term rates, thus flattening the profile of the overall borrowing yield curve.And sometimes the yield on short-term bonds can even go higher than that of long-term bonds.This isn’t just a flattening, but an “inversion”.Is that happening now?Not quite, but it’s getting close.The two bonds that traders and analysts conventionally use to test for an inversion is the gap between the 10-year US Treasury bond and the 2-year bond.That gap is down to just 10 basis points (0.1 percentage\u0026nbsppoints), having been falling steadily since the end of 2016.So why does it matter?Historically, major economic downturns in the US, but also in certain other advanced economies, have been preceded (by around 6 to 24 months) by an inversion of the yield curve.Research by John Williams, the new President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, has shown that the yield curve has been a better predictor of recessions than professional forecasters.A recession in the US, the planet’s biggest economy, would inevitably hit the rest of the world, including the UK.Incidentally, in the UK the 10-year2-year government bond yield gap is still around 70 basis points, though this too has fallen over the past two years.But why would an inversion signal a recession?The general argument is that\u0026nbsp traders expect the economy to be weaker further out than it is today and for the central bank to be compelled to cut interest rates at some point to support growth. \u0026nbspSo traders bid the yields on longer-term bonds lower than shorter ones in anticipation of that monetary policy shift (rate cuts mean higher bond prices which, in turn, mean\u0026nbsplower bond yields).Yet, if this is what’s going on, there’s no clear reason why this cooling should mean an outright recession rather than simply a growth slowdown.The fact that a recession has tended to follow inversions\u0026nbsphas merely been the historical pattern.So should we expect a recession for the US now?The US economy is not showing any of the conventional signs of dangerous overheating that could result in a slump.Unemployment is very low, at around 4 per cent, but inflation still seems reasonably quiescent at around 2.5 per cent.Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy, is only 2.15 per cent.Wages are rising at an annual rate of 3 per cent, below the levels seen before the global financial crisis.Some see signs of excessive borrowing among US households, but, again, leverage is not growing at anything like the rates seen before 2008.Any other contrary arguments?Major central banks around the world have spent trillions of dollars, euros, pounds and yen in buying up long-dated sovereign bonds over the past decade.This, the argument goes, has distorted long-term bond yields, meaning that one cannot, in the current circumstances, infer very much useful information from the shape of the curve.The current chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, has explicitly said he does not believe the flattening curve, and the possibility of inversion, signals an imminent downturn.Further, the predictor is not 100 per cent accurate. The Treasury curve flattened dramatically in the mid-1990s, during the Bill Clinton-boom, without leading to a US recession.The equivalent curve in the UK and Japan has sent misleading signals too in recent decades, missing recessions as well as sending out false positives.So we can relax?Not quite. Central bankers are certainly not omniscient about such matters.Back in 2006 one of Mr Powell’s predecessor, Ben Bernanke, argued firmly that a flattening US yield curve did not presage a recession. And there was a lot of talk then too about how the inverted yield curve was a broken indicator.When the crash came, not long after, it was, of course, the biggest since the Great Depression.Where does that leave us? While it would be foolish to ignore the yield curve given its empirically proven predictive power, it would also be a mistake to regard it as some kind of oracle.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Yet the series almost immediately transcended its format to deliver a moving and very funny rumination on depression and middle-age malaise. Will Arnett plays BoJack – one time star of Nineties hit sitcom Horsin’ Around – as a lost soul whose turbo-charged narcissism prevents him getting his life together. A valentine to the Spielberg school of Eighties blockbuster, with Winona Ryder as a small town mom whose son is abducted by a transdimensional monster. ET, Goonies, Close Encounters, Alien and everything Stephen King wrote between 1975 and 1990 are all tossed into the blender by Millennial writer-creators the Duffer brothers. It was clear Stranger Things was going to be a mega-smash when Barb – the “best friend” character eaten in the second episode – went viral the weekend it dropped. Netflix’s Marvel shows tend towards the overlong and turgid. An exception is the high-kicking Daredevil, with Charlie Cox’s blind lawyercrimefighter banishing all memory of Ben Affleck\u0027s turn donning the red jumpsuit in 2003. With New York’s Hell’s Kitchen neighbourhood as backdrop, Daredevil is caked in street-level grit and features a searing series one performance by Vincent D\u0027Onofrio as the villainous Kingpin. The perfect antidote to the deafening bombast of the big screen Marvel movies. Did he do it? Does it matter considering the lengths the Durham, North Carolina police seemingly went in order to stitch him up? Sitting through this twisting, turning documenting about the trial of Michael Peterson – charged with the murder in 2003 of his wife – the viewer may find themselves alternately empathising with and recoiling from the accused. It’s a feat of bravura factual filmmaking from French documentarian Jean-Xavier de Lestrade, which comes to Netflix with a recently shot three-part coda catching up with the (very weird) Peterson clan a decade on. Stranger Things: the Euro-Gloom years. Netflix’s first German-language production is a pulp romp that thinks it’s a Wagner opera. In a remote town surrounded by a creepy forest locals fear the disappearance of a teenager may be linked to other missing persons cases from decades earlier. The timelines get twisted and it’s obvious that something wicked is emanating from a tunnel leading to a nearby nuclear power plant. Yet if the story sometimes trips itself up the Goonies-meets-Götterdämmerung ambiance keeps you hooked. 625 A Series of Unfortunate EventsThe wry and bleak Lemony Snickett children novels finally get the ghastly adaptation they deserve (let’s all pretend the dreadful 2004 Jim Carrey movie never happened). Neil Patrick Harris gobbles up the scenery as the vain and wicked Count Olaf, desperate to separate the Baudelaire orphans from their considerable inheritance. The look is Tim Burton by way of Wes Anderson, and the dark wit of the books is replicated perfectly (Snickett, aka Daniel Handler, is co-producer). If you’re curious as to how Cary Fukunaga will handle the Bond franchise, his limited series, starring Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, drops some delicious hints. It’s a mind-bending sci-fi story set in an alternative United States where computers still look like Commodore 64s and in which you pay for goods by having a “travel buddy” sit down and read you adverts. The Breaking Bad prequel is starting to outgrow the show that spawned it. Where Breaking Bad delivered a master-class in scorched earth storytelling Saul is gentler and more humane. Years before the rise of Walter White, the future meth overlord’s sleazy lawyer, Saul Goodman, is still plain old Jimmy McGill, a striving every-dude trying to catch a break. But how far will he go to make his name and escape the shadow of his superstar attorney brother Chuck (Michael McKean)? Don’t tell Channel 4 but Charlie Brooker’s dystopian anthology series has arguably got even better since making the jump from British terrestrial TV to the realm of megabucks American streaming. Bigger budgets have given creators Brooker and Annabel Jones license to let their imaginations off the leash – yielding unsurpassable episodes such as virtual reality love story San Junipero and Star Trek parody USS Callister, which has bagged a bunch of Emmys. David Fincher produces this serial killer drama based on the writings of a real-life FBI psychological profiler. It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).A cartoon about a talking horse, starring the goofy older brother from Arrested Development… on paper little about BoJack Horseman screams “must watch”.

It’s the post-Watergate Seventies and two maverick G-Men (Jonathan Groff and Holt McCallany) are going out on a limb by utilising the latest psychological research to get inside the heads of a motley assembly of real-life sociopathic murders – including the notorious “Co-Ed” butcher Ed Kemper, brought chillingly to live in an Emmy-nominated performance by Cameron Britton. A right royal blockbuster from dramatist Peter Morgan (The Queen, Frost  Nixon). Tracing the reign of Elizabeth II from her days as a wide-eyed young woman propelled to the throne after the surprise early death of her father, The Crown humanises the royals even as it paints their private lives as a bodice-ripping soap. Matt Smith is charmingly roguish as Prince Philip and Vanessa Kirby has ascended the Hollywood ranks on the back of her turn as the flawed yet sympathetic Princess Margaret. This drug trafficking caper spells out exactly what kind of series it is with an early scene in which two gangsters zip around a multi-level carpark on a motorbike firing a machine gun. Narcos, in other words, is for people who consider Pacino’s Scarface a touch too understated. Series one and two feature a mesmerising performance by Wagner Moura as Columbian cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, while season three focuses on the notorious Cali cartel. Reported to be one of Netflix’s biggest hits – the company doesn’t release audience figures – the fourth season turns its attention to Mexico’s interminable drugs wars. A cloud hangs over Aziz Ansari’s future after he was embroiled in the #MeToo scandal. But whatever happens, he has left us with a humane and riveting sitcom about an Ansari-proximate character looking for love and trying to establish himself professionally in contemporary New York. One of Netflix’s early blockbusters, the sprawling soap opera updates Dallas to modern day southern Florida. Against the edge-of-civilisation backdrop of the Florida Keys, Kyle Chandler plays the local detective and favourite son of a well-to-do family. Their idyllic lives are thrown into chaos with the return of the clan’s black sheep (an unnervingly intense Ben Mendelsohn). The story is spectacularly hokey but searing performances by Chandler and Mendelsohn, and by Sissy Spacek and the late Sam Shepard as their imperious parents, make Bloodline compelling – a guilty pleasure that, actually, you shouldn’t feel all that guilty about. You can almost smell the shoddy sanitation and horse-manure in this lavish murder-mystery set in 19th New York. We’re firmly in Martin Scorsese\u0027s Gangs of New York territory, with a serial killer bumping off boy prostitutes across Manhattan. Enter pioneering criminal psychologist Dr Laszlo Kreisler (Daniel Brühl), aided by newspaper man John Moore (Luke Evans) and feisty lady detective Sara Howard (Dakota Fanning). Judd Apatow bring his signature gross-out comedy to the small screen. Love, which Apatow produced, is a masterclass in restraint compared to 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up etc. Paul Rust is Gus, a nerdish movie set tutor, whose develops a crush on Gillian Jacobs’s too-cool-for-school radio producer Mickey. Romance, of a sort, blossoms – but Love’s triumph is to acknowledge the complications of real life and to disabuse its characters of the idea that there’s such a thing as a straightforward happy ending. Hipster LA provides the bustling setting. Who says reality TV has to be nasty and manipulative? This updating of the early 2000s hit Queer Eye for the Straight Guy has five stereotype-challenging gay men sharing lifestyle tips and fashion advice with an engaging cast of All American schlubs (the first two seasons are shot mostly in the state of Georgia). There are laughs – but serious moment too, such as when one of the crew refuses to enter a church because of the still unhealed scars of his strict Christian upbringing. A high-gloss revamping of the traditional TV food show. Each episode profiles a high wattage international chef across its three seasons, the series has featured gastronomic superstars from the US, Argentina, India and Korea. A disastrous group interview in which actor Jason Bateman “mansplained” away the bullying co-star Jessica Walter had suffered at the hands of fellow cast-member Jeffrey Tambor meant season five of Arrested Development was fatally compromised before it even landed. Yet Netflix’s return to the dysfunctional world of the Bluth family stands on its merits and is a worthy addition to the surreal humour of seasons one through three (series four, which had to work around the busy schedules of the cast, is disposable by comparison). Netflix does Bladerunner with this sumptuous adaptation of the cult Richard Morgan novel. The setting is a neon-splashed cyberpunk future in which the super-wealthy live forever by uploading the consciousness into new “skins”. Enter rebel-turned-detective Takeshi Kovacs (Joel Kinnaman), hired to find out who killed a (since resurrected) zillionaire industrialist while dealing with fallout from his own troubled past. Rumoured to be one of Netflix’s most expensive projects yet, for its second run, Anthony Mackie (aka Marvel’s Falcon) replaced Kinnaman as the shape-shifting Kovacs.2125 Rick and MortyDan Harmon, creator of cult sitcom Community (also on Netflix), finds the perfect outlet for zany fanboy imagination with this crazed animated comedy about a Marty McFlyDoc Brown-esque duo of time travellers. Every genre imaginable is parodied with the manic energy and zinging dialogue we have come to expect from Harmon.Mad Men’s Alison Brie is our entry point into this comedy-drama inspired by a real life all-female wrestling league in the Eighties. Ruth Wilder (Brie) is a down-on-her luck actor who, out of desperation, signs up a wrestling competition willed into being by Sam Sylvia (podcast king Marc Maron). Britrock singer Kate Nash is one of her her fellow troupe members: the larger than life Rhonda “Britannica” Richardson.Deadpan animated satire about an idiot super spy with shaken and stirred mother issues. One of the most ambitious modern comedies, animated or otherwise, Archer tries on different varieties of humour for size and even occasionally tugs at the heart strings.Breaking Bad for those with short attention s. The saga of Walter White took years to track the iconic anti-hero’s rise from mild mannered everyman to dead-eyed criminal. Ozark gets there in the first half hour as nebbish Chicago accountant Marty Byrde (Jason Bateman) agrees to serve as lieutenant for the Mexican mob in the hillbilly heartlands of Ozark, Missouri (in return they thoughtfully spare his life). Bateman, usually seen in comedy roles, is a revelation as is Laura Linney as his nasty wife Wendy. There is also a break-out performance by Julia Garner playing the scion of a local redneck crime family.A heavenly comedy with a twist. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) is a cynical schlub waved through the Pearly Gates by mistake after dying in a bizarre supermarket accident. There she must remain above the suspicions of seemingly well-meaning but disorganised angel Michael (Ted Danson) whilst also negotiating fractious relationships with do-gooder Chidi (William Jackson Harper), spoiled princess Tahani (former T4 presenter Jameela Jamil) and ex-drug dealer Jason (Manny Jacinto).LeBlanc – who recently stepped away from hosting Top Gear following the next series – explained earlier this year why he would not want to return.“I understand that people really want to see that reunion,” he said, “but that show was about a finite period in those characters lives, between 20 and 30.Netflix ‘paid $100m’ to keep FriendsNetflix announces it won\u0027t be dropping Friends next yearEvery Christmas TV special on Netflix right now“To see what those characters are doing now, I think it’s almost a case of that the book is better than the movie. Everyone’s imagination of what they’re doing now is better.”Friends enduring popularity has meant demand for a revival has been in huge demand. Netflix recently paid a reported $100 million to keep the show on their streaming service.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Our competitors have become masters at exploiting the seams between peace and war what constitutes a weapon in this ‘grey zone’, below the threshold of conventional war, no longer has to go ‘bang’.”He pointed to a worrying lack of knowledge or interest among the public about how current geopolitical issues have evolved.“Of course, people don’t really study history any longer,” he said, pointing to a\u0026nbsprecent survey of 2,000 people about the First World War. “Fifty per cent thought Winston Churchill was the prime minister at the time, and 10 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was Margaret Thatcher\u0026nbsp20 per cent\u0026nbspthought we were fighting the French\u0026nbsp6 per cent\u0026nbspthought it was President Kennedy’s assassination that triggered the war.\u0026nbspAnd when asked what the bloodiest battle of the war was, 16 per cent\u0026nbspvoted for Pearl Harbour, 8 per cent\u0026nbspfor Independence Day, 7 per cent\u0026nbspfor Hastings and 5 per cent\u0026nbspfor Helm’s Deep – yes that’s 100 of the 2,000 who were asked – who thought it was a battle in the Lord of the Rings trilogy”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Armed police restrain a man inside the grounds of the Houses of Parliament in LondonA demonstrator dressed as Theresa May sells Brexit Fudge in Old Palace Yard, WestminsterA pro-brexit demonstrator speaks into a megaphone at the Brexit betrayal march in London.

No longer can we guarantee our freedom of action from air or sea and on land”, he said.Looking to the future, Gen Carter said: “We will need to be clear in a post-Brexit\u0026nbspworld what role we want to play in the world – for example, is our ambition to be globally deployable or global?

Well integrity has been checked and verified.”The company began pumping again this week after spending November working through their “wider hydraulic fracturing plan”, including conducting tests and analysis at the site.Environmental groups have passionately opposed the Lancashire site, which marks the first time fracking has taken place in the UK for seven years.“Within a day of Cuadrilla restarting fracking in Lancashire, there has already been another earthquake which means they’ve had to down tools,” said\u0026nbspFriends of the Earth campaigner Tony Bosworth.“It appears that they cannot frack without triggering tremors. And instead of acknowledging that fracking needs to end, Cuadrilla are instead urging for regulations around earthquakes to be relaxed.“We’ve always said that fracking poses risks for our climate and environment. After today’s quake, and with the effects of climate breakdown already happening around us, isn’t it time to put a stop to fracking once and for all?”While the most recent event was the largest\u0026nbsprecorded since fracking restarted, it is not as large as the two quakes that triggered a moratorium on the technique in 2011, one of which measured 2.3.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s clear that we now need the most precious commodity of all: time.”Sir John, who was prime minister from 1990 to 1997 and has backed a Final Say referendum on the Brexit outcome, called for “serious and profound reflection” on the country’s situation.“There will be a way through the present morass there always is.

In contrast, Brussels cannot block a revocation of Article 50, the European Court ruled.Richard Branson: Hard Brexit would be \u0027devastating\u0027 for holidaymakersDavid Cameron insists he does not regret calling Brexit referendumMay could delay vote on Brexit deal for more than a monthMay should resign if she loses no-confidence vote, MPs saySir John suggested revoking the notice would allow the UK to “stop the clock” – although the Court said it should be “unequivocal and unconditional, suggesting it could not be used as a negotiating tactic.He also warned about the potential for a return to violence if a hard Irish border returns.“The belief that because we have no violence in Northern Ireland for 18 years that it is gone forever is fatuous. Peace is never definitively forever. Things can go wrong,” he said.\u0026nbsp“We must do nothing to give them the opportunity of doing it and the imposition of a hard border is an opportunity for them to do it,” Sir John said.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

She will return to Brussels on Thursday and Friday to attend a meeting of the European Council, which all 28 EU leaders will attend.After meeting with Ms May, the German chancellor\u0026nbspAngela Merkel said there was “no way to change” the agreement, echoing the sentiments of other member states.Speaking separately in Brussels, French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau\u0026nbsptold reporters: “We’ve done a lot to help the UK, this withdrawal agreement is the only possible agreement, and we’ve done a lot of concessions to reach it. We sincerely hope that there can be a majority to ratify the withdrawal agreement but we have to stand ready for a no deal and we are preparing for it.”European Council president Donald Tusk, who met with Ms May in Brussels separately to Mr\u0026nbspJuncker, said he and the prime minister had had a “long and frank discussion”. He added that it was “clear that the EU27 wants to help” but that “the question is how”.\u0026nbspMs May said she believed there was “a shared determination to deal with this issue\u0026nbspand address this problem”.Theresa May’s Brexit deal cannot be renegotiated, Irish PM saysTheresa May’s backstop veto plan ‘would rip up withdrawal agreement’Though EU leaders and governments have said they will not renegotiate the deal, some have said they would like to help Ms May pass the plan through parliament by providing “reassurances” and “clarification”.Ms May appeared happy with this, telling reporters in Brussels: “We don’t want the backstop to be used and if it is we want to be certain that it is only temporary. It is those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days.”Tory Eurosceptic\u0026nbsprebels and the DUP have made clear that the backstop would have to be removed from the deal, time-limited, or\u0026nbspthe UK given the power to end it unilaterally if they are to back it. Without their support Ms May has little chance of passing the deal.Her admission that she is unlikely to be able to secure substantial changes to the agreement is likely to enrage Eurosceptics, amid reports from Westminster\u0026nbspthat a no-confidence vote from her own party could be looming.Juncker meet in Brussels on Tuesday evening (Reuters)Speaking in the European Parliament in Strasbourg in the morning, commission president Mr Juncker said: “The backstop is necessary for Ireland. Ireland will never be left alone.”He described Brexit as “a surprise guest” at the European Council summit scheduled for this end of this week, adding: “I am surprised because we had reached an agreement on 25 November together with the government of the UK.”Created with Sketch.

People were against no deal by 44 per cent to 37 per cent, for a new referendum by 46 per cent to 30 per cent and for Norway by 41 per cent to 39 per cent.A sign of just how difficult it will be to secure any deal that enjoys broad support came from another question, which asked respondents to say what it is that is most important for a Brexit deal to secure.The equal top answers were “controlling immigration” and “maintaining smooth trading links with the EU” – two things which, to an extent, are mutually exclusive because of the red lines set out by the EU and UK in negotiations.Ensuring that there is no border erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – the matter at the heart of opposition to Ms May’s plan – was rated as the key issue by just six per cent of people.EU ‘will renegotiate with Theresa May’ Brexit deal is voted down’Ms May is likely to play for time if the vote does go against her next week, and travel to Brussels for a summit of the European Council where she may ask for further concessions to try and make her deal more palatable to MPs.Despite a string of European figures saying there could be no further talks, ex-commission president Mr Prodi appeared to throw Ms May a lifeline on Saturday. Asked how he expected the commission to respond after the vote, he said: “Negotiate. We must keep free trade between us because it is in the British interests and European interest.”On Saturday, Ms Rudd hit out at Brexiteers who she said “flounce out quite a lot” instead of trying to get things done, an attack coming after Boris Johnson\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspDavid Davis\u0026nbspquit the cabinet over Ms May’s deal.\u0026nbspAll have leadership ambitions and have been jockeying for position ahead of a potential future contest in the coming weeks.In an interview, Ms Rudd also took the unusual step of revealing details of a private conversation with the prime minister, even critiquing her leadership style by saying “she is not always forthcoming” about what she wants.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspMs Rudd is seen as a leading candidate from the moderate wing of the party and even said in her interview that she hoped it chooses a “centrist” figure for its next leader, though she said a contest at this point would be “too indulgent”.Source Note: BMG Research interviewed a representative sample of 1,508 GB adults online between 4 and 7\u0026nbspDecember.

MPs should vote down the withdrawal agreement tomorrow and then support a People\u0027s Vote. If the country support continuing EU membership the court has told us we can revoke Art 50 and keep our existing terms. The threat to this strategy comes from Labour whose posturing around mythical renegotiation and a general election would waste the time we need to organise the referendum.The Commons committee on standards has just published its response to Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report into bullying and harassment of parliament\u0027s staff, writes my colleague\u0026nbspAshley\u0026nbspCowburn.It says greater freedoms should be given greater freedom to trigger investigations into historical investigations against MPs.The publication examined initial proposals for the House of Commons\u0027 standards system following Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report, which lifted the lid on a toxic culture at Westminster.The committee report said: We agree with the commissioner\u0027s view that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry relating to events more than seven years earlier is an unacceptable encroachment on her independence.We therefore recommend that this requirement should be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this.We believe there should be no exceptions to the general principle that the committee does not seek to direct the commissioner\u0027s operational decision-making.For that reason, we also recommend that the requirement for her to consult the committee before beginning an inquiry into a former member should also be abolished and that future editions of the guide to the rules should reflect this also.Labour MP Kate Green, who chairs the committee, said: It is vital that trust in the process is rebuilt, following the criticisms in Dame Laura Cox\u0027s report.Whilst there is clearly much more to be done, our recommendations will make an important step forward towards a fairer, more independent and credible system.The Standards Committee is unique in having an equal number of MPs and lay members on it, and these proposals will ensure that the skills and expertise of the lay members can help to hold MPs to account in the most effective way.No 10 has confirmed that there will be a Cabinet conference call at 11.30am but insisted this\u0026nbspis to update ministers on Theresa May\u0027s conversations with EU leaders over the weekend,\u0026nbsprather than about any plans to call\u0026nbspoff tomorrow\u0027s vote.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said the vote will go ahead as planned and Ms May is confident of winning it.This is from our deputy political editor, Rob Merrick, following this morning\u0027s No 10 briefing with journalists here in Westminster...\u0026nbspDowning Street has announced that urgent talks are talking place now with cabinet ministers, amid continued suggestions that tomorrow’s ‘meaningful vote’ could yet be pulled.Theresa May’s spokeswoman insisted that was not the purpose of the sudden conference call, telling journalists: “The vote is going ahead as planned.”Instead, the talks were intended to update the cabinet on talks the prime minister held over the weekend with various EU leaders, she said.The spokeswoman refused to go into what was discussed with EU leaders, saying it would not right to do so before cabinet ministers were informed.However, she continued to insist the withdrawal agreement had been “agreed and negotiated” – and that reopening it could backfire on the UK, by allowing some EU countries to push for tougher terms.Ms May will be in Brussels on Thursday, for an EU summit. Asked if, as rumoured, she could travel there before Thursday, the spokeswoman replied: “There are no plans to do that.”\u0026nbspOver the weekend, the prime minister spoke with Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Junker, heads of the EU council and commission respectively, as well as with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the prime ministers of Ireland and the Netherlands.NEW: Asked if the vote is being called off, one Cabinet source tells me: Looks it.BREAKING: Theresa May will give a statement in the Commons on Brexit at 3.30pm. All the signs are that the vote is being called off.BREAKING: Theresa May has called off tomorrow\u0027s vote, a very well-placed source has told me.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn has responded to tomorrow\u0027s vote being delayed. He said:\u0026nbsp“The government has decided Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal is so disastrous that it has taken the desperate step of delaying its own vote at the eleventh hour.\u0026nbspWe have known for at least two weeks that Theresa May’s worst of all worlds deal was going to be rejected by Parliament because it is damaging for Britain. Instead, she ploughed ahead when she should have gone back to Brussels to renegotiate or called an election so the public could elect a new government that could do so.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We don\u0027t have a functioning government. While Theresa May continues to botch Brexit, our public services are at breaking point and our communities suffer from dire under-investment.\u0026nbsp“Labour’s alternative plan for a jobs first deal must take centre stage in any future talks with Brussels.”Steve Baker, the Eurosceptic ERG\u0027s main organiser, says:\u0026nbspThis is essentially a defeat of the prime minister\u0027s Brexit deal. The terms of the withdrawal agreement were so bad that they didn\u0027t dare put it to Parliament for a vote. This isn\u0027t the mark of a stable government or a strong plan.\u0026nbspHe added\u0026nbspParliament should be been allowed to voice its concerns about the proposed withdrawal agreement. Without a clear rejection of the terms by MPs, the prime minister has kicked the can down the road and the EU is very unlikely to re-negotiate.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But at the moment I’m looking at who is in the papers, who can we get behind, but it shouldn’t be about the personality it should be about the country.”\u0026nbspMs McVey\u0026nbspsaid she would support the prime minister if she were to go back to Brussels and try and renegotiate the deal, in particular around the Irish backstop and the £39bn ‘orce bill’ that Ms May’s withdrawal agreement accounts for.Mr Raab was interviewed on the same show, and asked if he would rule out a run, he said: “I’ve always said I wouldn’t rule it out, but I’m just not going to get sucked in to that debate.“The public and people watching this show would think it would be very self-indulgent to be engaging in that speculation.”He would not comment when asked if he would stand aside for fellow Brexiteer Boris Johnson to run for the leadership.It\u0026nbspcame as comments the government was hit by another resignation over the Brexit plan –\u0026nbspWill Quince, a ministerial aide to defence secretary Gavin Williamson.He hit out at the backstop plan to avoid a hard border with Ireland, saying it could result in the UK being “tied to the negotiating table for years, until we agree to anything in desperation” to get out of the situation.For her part, Ms May warned Tory MPs they risk handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to Number 10 unless they back her Brexit deal in an interview with Mail on Sunday, .“It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal,” she told the Mail on Sunday.“We have a leader of the Opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country.“As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take.”Reports suggested Ms May could make an emergency trip to Brussels ahead of a planned summit on Thursday in an effort to secure further concessions in an effort to win over critics of her plan.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But, since then, the Mr\u0026nbspPichai\u0026nbsphas held closed door meetings with members of\u0026nbspCongress\u0026nbspto discuss what Republicans have branded as liberal bias at Google.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialFollow updates from the hearing below and watch a\u0026nbsplive stream of the testimony here.Hello and welcome to our live blog of the congressional testimony of Google CEO Sundar Pichai.\u0026nbspWe are waiting on Mr Pichai to arrive.In attendance in Washington today is Alex Jones, the conservative conspiracy theorist who has had plenty of problems with social media over the past year.\u0026nbspJones was in attendance the last time tech CEOs came to testify before Congress, and tends to get into squabbles with folks on a regular basis.\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll see if any Jones news comes out of today\u0027s hearing when the Judiciary Committee calls a recess.Mr Goodlatte has opened the hearing, and recognized House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as a witness.\u0026nbspMr McCarthy has thanked Mr Pichai, and called Google one of the most valuable companies in the world.Mr McCarthy cited a\u0026nbspWall Street Journal\u0026nbspstatistic that said that 90 per cent of internet searches goes through Google.\u0026nbspHe has also said that there is a widening gap of trust between users and technology companies. He went on to suggest that political biases must not seep into Google\u0027s search product.Chairman Goodlatte says that Google is able to collect an amount of data that would make the NSA blush.\u0026nbspHe said that most Americans probably have no idea how much information Google might be collecting about them when they use the platform.Chairman Goodlatte has now said he is interested in how Google handles objectionable content.\u0026nbspHe also has mentioned algorithmic screening, and the dangers that tinkering with that system could have. He then claimed that some Google employees have considered tinkering with the algorithm.Chairman Goodlatte is hitting on a lot of issues here, and has now mentioned that Android smartphones are able to collect a massive amount of data from users during the course of the day.\u0026nbspThat includes tracking data on movement, and even the mode of transport that someone may take.Ranking member Jerry Nadler is now giving his opening remarks, after Mr Goodlatte thanked Mr Pichai for attending the hearing.\u0026nbspMr Nadler has called the idea that Google and other tech companies have anti-conservative bias a fantasy. He said that he expects Republicans to bring up anecdotes, but that they will provide little evidence of an anti-conservative bias.\u0026nbspMr Nadler, on the other hand, has suggested that they should be concerned about online efforts to spread disinformation. He referenced the 2016 election, in which Russia attacked the US elections in favour of President Donald Trump.Mr Pichai is describing his childhood and the changes that technology had on his life before he moved to the United States 25 years ago.\u0026nbspHe has been the CEO of Google for the past three years.Mr Pichai is noting that Google is a major driver of jobs in the US, and that the company is able to help businesses all across the country.\u0026nbspHe noted that the company drives a massive portion of the US economy. He also said that Google works with the government.\u0026nbspI\u0027m proud to\u0026nbspsay that we do and we will continue to work with the government to keep our company safe and secure, Mr Pichai said.Mr Goodlatte has asked if Android phones send information to servers every few minutes, including location, altitude, temperature, and other data points.\u0026nbspMr Pichai has said that Google goes out of its way to give people the ability to control their privacy.\u0026nbspHe said that users have a choice on what data they send, and that some apps — like fitness apps — require certain data collection.Mr Pichai has said that Google offers privacy checkups in order for users to review what information Google collects on them.\u0026nbspHe said that users are able to review data and then to decide if data is stored or\u0026nbsp deleted. He also said that users can take their data with them if they choose to use other services.\u0026nbspWe want to make this work in a sustainable way, Mr Pichai said of platforms like YouTube, and ensuring that the content is agreeable.Please allow a moment for the live blog to updateShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Let’s look forward with confidence.”Javid has said he will launch a leadership challengeTheresa Mays Brexit deal collapses and shes ousted as Prime Minister.He has reportedly begun to gather support from ministers and is creating a team to help him bid to become the first non-white PM.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson are reported to also be seeking support for their own leadership bids.One Cabinet minister told The Sun: “Sajid is tapping us up. He is very direct, but he’s not offering jobs yet, which wouldn’t be a good look”.Another senior Tory disclosed: “He told me that Theresa’s Brexit deal is s***, she’ll be forced out when it falls, and he is then going to declare immediately”.Javid has said he would support a no-deal Brexit and has been backed by leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom.The government has been rocked by the scandal of Windrush-generation immigrants who have been treated as criminals by the Home Office despite living here legally for decades.Commonwealth citizens were encouraged to move to Britain from the s to s, but many were later unable to prove their right to be here.

The French would come for our fish and our banks. The Germans would want concessions on EU immigration.Other countries would want more money.It would be a nightmare negotiation. So why do my friends think they must vote for it Because they believe that there is no alternative: that we may not like what has happened – but that we have run out of time and run out of road.It is crucial to understand that this pessimism is just flat wrong.If this deal is voted down on Tuesday – and I devoutly hope it is - we need to do two big things.First we need to change the Withdrawal Agreement, keeping all the sensible things that have been agreed on citizens’ rights, but getting rid of the “backstop” agreement on the Northern Irish border.We should use the so-called transition period both to negotiate a big and generous zero tarf zero quota free trade deal, and to solve the technical problems posed by the Northern Ireland border.There is no reason why we should not use that time – almost two years – to put in place the systems that will allow our whole country to come out of both the customs union and the single market, which is what the people were promised both at the referendum and the general election.We should be clear that we will keep back at least half of the £billion until the free trade deal is done.And second it is time now to show our EU friends that we mean business.This should be a take it or leave it offer – and so show that we mean business we must be able to walk away.This is a great country, capable of rising to immense challenges – and I believe the people of this country are fed up to the back teeth of being told by their government that they are simply incapable of managing the logistical problems of Brexit, when for two and a half years this government has studiously and deliberately failed to address those logistical problems.It is that failure and that lack of resolve that has so weakened our hand in the talks.Now is the time to get on with it – and remember,we have to go down this route, we will have the entire £billion to spend on it.We need to get our ports ready, hire the staff, ensure that the planes can fly and that companies are helped to transfer their data under any circumstances.I don’t believe for a moment that our EU friends and partners want such an outcome.They have a £ billion surplus with us in goods alone.They don’t want barriers to trade.They want a deal as much as we do.Do you really think that the people of the Calais region would be gratefulthe Paris government took steps to block commercial traffic from the UK Have you seen what is going on in France No one wants disruption of any kind – and the way to avoid it is to get ready to manage it now, with energy and conviction.We can still get a great deal, and I am sure we will.

Over two years later, it’s time to settle the squabbles and get on with the job.I want MPs to support the Prime Minister’s agreement on Tuesday because it offers the surest path to Brexit.The alternatives – a second referendum or no Brexit at all – would fly in the face of the will of the British people. Instead of honouring and respecting the referendum, politicians would be ignoring the result.Pulling out of the EU is a hugely complex task. Leaving a bloc that we joined nearly  years ago, while staying friends with its members, means that everyone has to compromise.Some people legitimately say that the Withdrawal Agreement is not perfect, but it offers the most practical way of doing what the British electorate want.People voted to take back control of our borders, laws and money. This deal fulfils those instructions, while protecting jobs and the integrity of our United Kingdom.If you are in the EU, you have to accept the automatic right of any citizen of any other member state to live and work in your country.This agreement will end that situation and restore the British Government’s power to decide who should settle in our country. We will admit people with the right skills for our economy, regardless of their background.Britain is generous and tolerant, so the rights of EU citizens already living here will be protected, along with the rights of Britons residing in the EU.We will also stop making vast annual payments to the EU, allowing the British Government to decide on public spending priorities.As I know from my previous job, this Government’s priority is the NHS.

If so, we need to massively ramp up preparation for a clean break.Why wouldn’t the EU come up with a sensible compromise Because this is a club of ideological bullies whose commitment to the project is far more important to them than the interests of their own citizens.They want us to hold a second referendum, so we make the “right” choice.But another ballot would be a disaster for trust in our democracy.The arrogance of those pushing for one here at home knows no bounds.It’s now revealed that Tony Blair, now effectively the Remain architect-in-chief, demanded that the body set up to scrutinise the work of former frontline politicians didn’t publish how he earned his cash after he left office.He doesn’t want us to find out, and he certainly doesn’t want us to have any say in the future of the country.He, and those around him, think they know best.But .million people think dferently — and Theresa May owes them every ounce of her strength.YET more evidence that the NHS is in need of desperate reform.An “over-s” AE wing  Bereaved parents being shafted It’s not money that’s the problem.

We are due to leave the EU on March  next year, deal or no deal — and Parliament cannot agree what to do.Some MPs want the PM to go back to Brussels and negotiate something better. Others want to negotiate a dferent deal altogether. Labour wants an election. Die-hard Remainers want another referendum. Many Leavers just want to get out without a deal.And Mrs May insists her deal is the right one, despite knowing it is so unpopular that she couldn’t put it to a vote in the Commons.Whoever gets their way, it is time to strap on our seatbelts and brace ourselves for an almighty crash. However things end, we are heading for multiple constitutional crises that risk smashing our political system to pieces.Yesterday Mrs May promised more assurances from Brussels about her deal’s so-called “backstop”, in which we will be trapped in a customs union with the EU, and Northern Ireland will be trapped inside the single market.But it is completely implausible that she will be able to negotiate an end to the backstop or the right to simply withdraw from it in future.So convinced was the PM that she could not win this argument with Brussels, she did not propose it during the original talks. The Europeans insist they will not make any legally binding commitments about how the backstop might end.So the only effect of delaying the vote is to take up even more time before March . In other words, the game of chicken between ministers and rebel MPs will get more and more high-risk.The time for MPs to prevent a no-deal Brexit will be cut short, the chances of no deal will increase and ministers — because they want to bully Parliament into accepting their deal — will continue to refuse to prepare properly for no deal.And remember what the PM’s deal involves. For nearly two years — but maybe longer — we will pay into the EU budget, accept free movement and respect all European laws.Then, when there is no agreement on the future relationship, we will find ourselves in the backstop. Northern Ireland will effectively be annexed by Brussels. British goods heading for Ulster will be stopped and checked, European goods will be waved through. The EU will decide how other countries can trade with Britain, without our say and regardless of the effects on British jobs. And we will be forced to follow the rulings of the European Court of Justice.Our constitution says Parliament is sovereign: Nothing is more powerful than an Act of Parliament, debated and approved by elected representatives.What’s more, no Parliament can “bind its successors”: One generation of MPs cannot dictate what future generations can and cannot decide.Yet the PM’s deal subordinates Parliament to the EU, and does so permanently, with no legal right for Britain to escape its punishing terms. It would leave us as a colony: A country dismembered and incapable of democratic self-government.The remaining options are just as dangerous. Many pro- Europeans want Britain to join the European Economic Area and form a customs union with the EU.Norway Plus, as their plan is now known, would mean Britain accepting even more European laws than the PM proposes, without any say over what they are. For that reason, coupled with the knowledge that it does not avoid the backstop, Norway Plus is even worse than Theresa May’s deal.Yet the “Norwegians” inside the Conservative Party persist. They know there is no majority among Tory MPs for their model but they have a plan.If Mrs May’s deal is rejected and they win a majority for Norway Plus with support from Labour MPs, they can install a caretaker prime minister to deliver it.With a Commons majority for Norway Plus, they believe the Queen would be obliged to appoint their man — David Lidington, perhaps — as PM.The risk to the monarchy of embroiling the Queen in a political controversy of such magnitude seems not to matter to them. One other option, pushed by a handful of Conservatives and many Labour MPs, is to re-run the referendum. Their goal is to remain in the EU after all.The possibility they might lose, the effects on public confidence in our democracy and the instability caused by a narrow remain victory do not matter.For these Europhiles, staying in the EU is more important than the damage they might do to Parliament and to the party system our democracy relies upon.The default option, however,Parliament rejects the PM’s deal, is a no-deal Brexit. That was decided when Parliament passed the Withdrawal Act earlier this year. To override that Act, Parliament must do more than hold a single vote, and the Government must do more than negotiate something .Parliament must amend the Withdrawal Act or pass another Act to set us on a dferent path. If there is any ambiguity, the Supreme Court — whose president, Baroness Hale, has challenged the sovereignty of Parliament in the past — might again play a controversial role.While the Commons is ided, we know a majority of MPs are determined to stop a no-deal Brexit at almost any cost. Some senior Tories say they will vote against the Government in a confidence motion — risking the election of Jeremy Corbyn —it means they can stop leaving without a deal.It is probable we are heading for Norway Plus or another referendum. Whatever happens, the constitutional consequences are likely to be profound.The power of the courts, the party system, Parliamentary sovereignty, the future of the Union, even the monarchy, might come under scrutiny. Whatever happens will be controversial and further ide the country. But something has to give.So buckle your seatbelts and adopt the brace position.

In some quarters she would be described as a high-class escort.Naseem, who lives in Amersham, Bucks, with his estranged partner and two children, wore a dark suit, white shirt, burgundy tie and glasses as he sat quietly in the dock in front of a public gallery packed with relatives and friends.The pair had met on several occasions and arranged to see each other in Crawley before her birthday celebrations, the court heard.They were seen buying alcohol in a nearby shop and when police searched the flat, a blood-stained bottle of Courvoisier brandy, cocaine and poppers were found.One of them, Roshan Periag, was so worried he drove to the flat in the early hours of the morning to try to find her before going to the nearest police station.When officers arrived at the scene and broke down the door, Naseem was found lying motionless on the sofa with his eyes flickering.He appeared to respond to light and a paramedic was sceptical that he was unconscious, the court heard.After being arrested he was taken to hospital to be assessed where doctors discovered injuries consistent with self-harming.He was discharged before being questioned by police.He claimed the last thing he could remember was passing out after the pair met up in the flat, the court heard.But Mr Tehrani said: The prosecution say there was nothing wrong with him. He was play acting.Examination of his phone found he had sent another sex worker a pornographic picture and a naked video of himself in the flat appearing to masturbate in the hours after Ms Abbotts is thought to have been killed, the court was told.Officers found a mortar - the other half of the pestle set - in the kitchen.Naseems fingerprints were found in blood on the side of the bath, on a meat cleaver in the kitchen and on Ms Abbotts iPhone. Blood was also found in a half-filled bath with a kne at the bottom and other knives on the sofa.Mr Tehrani said there was no sign of forced entry and that only someone with the powers of Spiderman would have been able to access the flat in the top floor of the block in the Gossops Green area of the West Sussex town.A post-mortem found she died of blunt-forced trauma to the head, sustaining  tears and two bruises, and there were signs of attempted strangulation on her neck.The trial continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/NINTCHDBPICT000447292778.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"sajid javid humiliated as home office u turn to suspend uk visas for the super rich after just five days","story":"Sources told The Sun that the Home Secretary had been ordered into a u-turn by the Cabinet – who only found out about the shock move when it was announced last Thursday.At the time, Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes announced that the ‘Golden Visa’ or ‘Tier ’ route into Britain for tycoons hoping to live and invest in the UK was being frozen amid concerns about organised crime and money laundering.She said: “I have been clear that we will not tolerate people who do not play by the rules and seek to abuse the system.”But yesterday, in a brief statement, the Home Office said: “The Tier visa is not currently suspended.”A senior source told The Sun: “They forgot to do a write-around to the rest of the Cabinet as they thought they had clearance for this.“When they did the write-around it got blocked.”The ‘Golden visa’ provides a fast track route to settlement for people willing to invest millions in the UK.Under the Home Office plans announced last week, it was going to be suspended until new rules were put in place next year. This would have starved the country of wealthy investors for months.The latest gaffe follows an ongoing delay to the publication of the Immigration White Paper amid a Cabinet stand-off over post-Brexit controls.And the Home Office is still battling the fallout of the Windrush scandal earlier this year where it emerged Commonwealth nationals living in the UK for years had been wrongly deported and deprived of medical care.The new rules were likely to ask applicants to provide comprehensive audits of their financial and business interests – and proof they had control of £ million of investment funds. It follows a Government review of the visa route as part of a crackdown on money laundering.Some  applications for the ‘golden visas’ came in July alone – up nearly  per cent on a year ago.

But Cabinet Ministers admitted privately a leadership contest now appeared inevitable.Brexiteers who have been baying for Mrs May’s head ever since she agreed her outline deal with Brussels last month said a contest could take place next Monday. The PM will need  votes from Tory MPs to survive. One Tory said: “It could leave us without a Prime Minister over Christmas and New Year. But to be fair we haven’t really had one for some time now.”The putsch came as the PM launched a desperate whistle-stop tour of Europe to try and win fresh concessions on her Brexit deal to help get it through the Commons.

This, alas, is the position the Government and the Prime Minister have now reached.For many people their virtues and vices are cut from the same cloth. Indeed, one may simply be an extension of another. This is what we have seen with Mrs May.Her very steadiness, dutulness and determination have led her to be unable to see that her policy has failed. In her latest House of Commons statement it was once again the mantra that “nothing has changed” — these three small dangerous words that did so much damage to her election campaign were wheeled out again but convinced nobody.After Ministers had taken to the media to insist that the vote on her deal would go ahead there was not one word of apology to them or hint of embarrassment that policy had turned on a sixpence. Continuity, instead, was claimed.At the heart of this humiliation was a dreadful deal that does not represent Brexit. As a London cab driver told me yesterday, he did not vote for a deal. He voted to leave.That widespread sentiment is not honoured in the Withdrawal Agreement, which subjects the United Kingdom to the European Union as a vassal state or colony.Yet the humiliation is even greater for having failed even to allow her deal to be voted on in Parliament. Fearing a huge defeat the Prime Minister is now scurrying around the Continent asking for something she said was impossible a few days ago.Last week this deal was the only one available and the British people were told to like it or lump it.Today, apparently new assurances can be given which will allay our fears. Both positions cannot be true and as EU officials have been arrogantly dismissive of Mrs May’s request it seems that only the airline profit margins will benefit from these trips.However, it could have been so dferent. Had the Prime Minister held the vote and lost by over  votes then she would have had proof to show the European Union that the deal could not pass through Parliament.It would have made it abundantly clear that the Withdrawal Agreement had failed and would have encouraged the EU to take her request for change seriously. Instead the President of the Commission and of the Council have mocked her and almost thrown back in her face the line that “nothing has changed”.Fortunately the UK has a trump card, which is to leave without a deal. In these circumstances we would save £billion of taxpayer’s money and be able to remove all tarfs on goods we do not produce,  helping the least well off.We can immediately cut VAT on domestic fuel, helping the elderly in the winter and remove it from women’s sanitary products where the imposition of tax is an injustice.The Prime Minister has challenged those who want to deliver on the Referendum result to be “honest” about the risks of leaving without a deal, including potential queues at Dover, as there have been in the past when the French go on strike or blockade the roads.There is inevitably a risk that the EU is determined to punish a country that leaves and is willing to break International Treaty obligations.On the other hand there are tangible advantages to be had, too, as Mrs May must herself recognise. Otherwise she ought not to have said “no deal is better than a bad deal”. If she never believed this to be the case then it explains why her negotiating position has been so weak and submissive to the EU. It is the root cause of her failure.This must now be recognised. The Government’s Policy, personally linked to the Prime Minister and the operation at Downing Street, has produced an agreement that fails to deliver Brexit and breaks Theresa May’s own promises.This has lost her the confidence of the House of Commons, for she can no longer push her most important business through, and by all constitutional precedence she ought to resign.Mrs May is a decent person with many honourable characteristics but her handling of Brexit has been hopeless, and has left the country, the Conservative Party and the Government humiliated.As we look to forge an agreement that could set our relations with our nearest neighbours for generations and define the authority of our own democracy, it is time for someone who backs Brexit to take over.Theresa May has failed because she never really wanted to do it. She is now caught in the web that she herself spun, and it is her duty to go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are at the beginning of something, not the end.“We’re going to need a lot more than what we have been offered today.”It has emerged that Mrs May is prepared to hold out for up to five weeks and delay the Commons vote until January she has to.The PM had breakfast with Dutch premier Mark Rutte, lunch with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, tea with EU Council President Donald Tusk before a final coffee with EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker.The trip was initially beset by a PR disaster, when Mrs May got locked in the back of her Mercedes limo on arrival at the Chancellery in Berlin.As Mrs Merkel waited on the red carpet and TV cameras looked on, the PM’s embarrassed police bodyguards struggled to free her for  seconds.Putting a brave face on the day, Mrs May said the meetings showed “a shared determination to deal with this issue and address this problem”.She added: “We don’t want the backstop to be used andit is we want to be certain that it’s only temporary”.While offering the PM warm words in public, one after each other EU leaders made it clear that the deal struck three weeks ago could not be reopened.Mr Tusk said his talks with Mrs May had been “long and frank”, adding in a tweet: “Clear that EU wants to help. The question is how”.Angela Merkel brutally shut down attempts to redraw the backstop yesterday, telling the PM at a meeting in Berlin there is “no way to change” the deal.The Chancellor also said she should speak to Brussels, not Member States, and afterwards told her own MPs there won’t be any more Brexit talks.Mr Rutte would only describe his long meeting with Mrs May, at which the two leaders were pictured sitting awkwardly far apart, as a “useful dialogue”.Before Mrs May’s arrival in Berlin, Germany’s European Affairs Minister Michael Roth was even blunter.Mr Roth said: “I hope that they wish each other a Merry Christmas, but there will definitely not be any assurances that we will reopen negotiations.““The negotiators are not in Berlin, they are here in Brussels”.Mr Juncker also insisted there is “no room whatsoever for renegotiation” and only “further clarications and further interpretations” was the PM’s best hope.The PM will hold an even tougher showdown today with Irish PM Leo Varadkar, flying to Dublin tonight after the Cabinet’s weekly meeting.Ahead of it, the Taoiseach infuriated No by issuing a call to the House of Commons to rise up against the PM.He told Irish MPs yesterday that he would “never compromise on the written letter of the backstop”.Mr Varadkar also said he was ready to stare down Mrs May and see Parliament step in as “there’s a majority that the UK should not be plunged into a no-deal”.He added: “It is in their hands at any point in time to take the threat of no-deal off the table either by revoking Article  orthat’s a step too far, by extending it”.At home, a Brexiteer Cabinet minister stepped up the pressure on Mrs May to say that only “legally binding assurances” on the backstop would be acceptable.Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom also insisted a “back to the drawing board” approach was now needed rather than cosmetics.Leading backbench Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Mrs May of “modelling herself on Humpty Dumpty”, adding: “Her words mean ‘just what she chooses to mean - nothing more and nothing less’”.Mr Rees-Mogg told talkRADIO: “The PM goes off to Brussels, gets a nice cup of cocoa and it means nothing.“She will come back with a deal and it will still not pass.”Other Tory MPs said it was time for Britain to strat preparing to walk away without any deal.Former deputy speaker Nigel Evans said: “If there’s not going to be a meeting of minds, the Prime Minister might as well come home and prepare us for leaving on World Trade Organisation rules and the European Union doesn’t get its £ billion.“They need that money. I think the PM should just give her telephone number for Juncker to speed dial her.” The former PM said aof a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic risks reviving tensions behind the deadly Troubles. Speaking in Dublin he said: “Nearby graveyards bear witness to how bad were those days. “No sensible person can wish toto them.”As it stands, that is where we are heading.

A phenomenon you’ll be well aware of,you watch television or engage with Twitter.The Last Leg’s Adam Hills, for instance, is a helluvaguy. So are presenters like Nish Kumar, James O’Brien and all those other blokes who cannot stop wanging on, very publicly, about their feminist credentials and just how much they love the NHS.While others might rely simply on empty words though, Nick Knowles preferred grand heroic gestures, right from day one in the jungle when he threw himself into the water to save four women who were in absolutely no danger of drowning.The idea that Nick Knowles was every woman’s Sir Galahad, was clearly never in doubt then. At least not in his own mind.The ever-so-slightly deluded David Brent-side to his character did not fully emerge, though, until the very last week when James McVey revealed Nick’s version of Make You Feel My Love had gone to number one in the iTunes chart.A stroke of genius for production to let the news slip, obviously, and for someone to send an acoustic guitar into camp, so that Nick could delight everyone with an unplugged rendition, which Emily Atack described as “a viral moment,” much like Ebola.Dec was clearly having the time of his le poking fun at Knowles as well, describing him as: “So good at DIY he’s even gravelled his voice.”I need nearly hardly tell you what happened next then.The public got rid of Nick Knowles, just as they get rid of any jungle contestant who’s ever shown the slightest inclination to act like an entertaining jerk.This is a problem that dates right back to series one, of course, when livewires Uri Geller, Darren Day, Rhona Cameron and Nigel Benn were all voted out before silent Nell McAndrew, and it continues to prevent a genuinely great line-up from turning into a genuinely great series, eventhis one did end with exactly the right winner in Harry Redknapp.I don’t see any way round the problem, either. The voting public just seems to prefer self-absorbed young bores, on “a journey,” to genuine characters.If any of us thought Nick Knowles was finished, the moment Dec read out his name, though, we reckoned without an eviction interview which will surely take its place in I’m A Celeb . . .  folklore.For it turns out Nick Knowles wasn’t in the jungle for purely personal or financial gain.It was to heal a ided nation.“We’re having such a hard time in the UK,” he told Dec, alluding to Brexit, “I thought,we can get on, it might be a bit of a pointer to the nation.”Gee, thanks Nick. I had been wondering why a cane toad was sat on your head, during the Wicked Warehouse task, but it’s beginning to make sense now. He wasn’t finished either.“I’d like to say one last thing.” Go on . ..“Please support veterans, support the police, support the NHS, support the emergency services.They have it a lot harder, on a day to day basis, than we have it in here.”A hell-of-a-claim to make when you’ve reportedly just been paid £, to sit around a television set, in Australia, with John Barrowman, but then Nick Knowles is clearly a helluvaguy.SO there was Gemma Collins behaving like a monstrous old boot as usual, last week, when fellow BBC diner Adrian Chiles silenced her with a simple question.“Is there anything you can’t stop eating ”At which point you could see Gemma disengaging from the conversation as she ran through the checklist: “Cakes, buns, crisps, Pringles, biscuits, pies, potatoes, cows, pigs, horses, breeze blocks, deep-fried landfill, light aircraft . . . ”The silence couldn’t last forever, obviously, but it was a nice  seconds on BBC’s I’ll Get This, a celeb dinner party show, that I hadn’t really seen the point of up until the arrival of Chiles, who has a streak of honesty that’s very rare among presenters.Even by Adrian’s own standards, though, his response to the question “Why would you make the best chat show host ” was brutally self-aware.“For a huge amount of money, a big hullabaloo, billboards everywhere, I went to ITV and did another chat show, Daybreak, at which I was s**t.“I failed abysmally, humiliatingly. I looked miserable, I was sullen, I sat there like a bag of potatoes, I dragged everyone down with me, from the moment I walked in the door at am.“SoI ever get the chance to host another chat show, let’s be honest, unlikely, I will be the best chat show host ever, ’cos I know what it’s like to succeed and I know what it’s like to fail, dismally.”A confession that I expected to be met with stunned silence but it was actually greeted by spontaneous applause, from fellow celebs, and a faint whirring noise from Gemma Collins’ brain: “Doritos, kebabs, dips, mini eclairs, maxi eclairs, Jenny Eclairs . . . ”I PARTED company with Celebrity Antiques Road Trip the moment the commentator announced: “Russell Kane’s heading for an auction at Penkridge.”Anyone know how much he fetched UK’S Strongest Man. Best dead-weight lt was, of course, won by Declan Donnelly . . .  who carried about  kilos for three weeks.FRANCE is burning, Paris is in lockdown and its government’s on the brink.So how many mentions do you think TV’s fearlessly impartial satirical news shows, Have I Got News For You, The Mash Report and The Last Leg, gave it, on Friday Correct. None. Because these inconvenient facts don’t fit the narrative and agenda of the BBC and Channel , which believe Britain is a basket case and Europe is our only salvation.So it was simply ignored and all three proceeded with the same lazy and witless anti-Brexit and Trump routines they go with every week.There were some slight iations with the other material, obviously.The Last Leg and HIGNFY, ably hosted by Danny Dyer, both invited lists to be outraged by alleged sexism at the Ballon D’Or awards, held in Paris, ironically.While the final Mash Report of the series offered Rachel Parris lecturing viewers about poverty, as only a privately-educated, Oxbridge graduate truly can, before smug-bucket in chief Nish Kumar closed the show by saying: “We’ll be back next year,the will of the people demands it.”Which is almost the very last thing the will of the people will ever demand.The Mash Report will be back, though. The political agenda of the BBC demands it.Who said the following last week: “Oh my God, there’s a cockroach having dinner on my butthole.”A John Barrowman doing the Rotten Retrieval trial on I’m a Celebrity B Tyson Fury during his Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan Sent in by Connor David.

The Labour leader insisted he would wait until the appropriate time to unseat the PM despite calls by four party leaders. The leaders of the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens all demanded he lodge a challenge to Mrs May. But he said it was better to wait until after she finally holds a vote on her Brexit deal - which could be late January. The issue prompted a row within Labour, with more than  MPs urging Mr Corbyn to force out the government now. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also warned Theresa May was trying to run down the clock before Brexit Day on March  and Parliament cannot allow her to get away with that. She said: I want to see a confidence motion that preferably brings this sorry excuse for a government down.  Mr Corbyn, however, said: We have no confidence in this Government. We need to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time to have a motion of no confidence in order to get rid of this Government. Labour argue there is no point forcing a no confidence vote until it can be won. Currently the DUP - whose  MPs prop up the Tory government - are not thought to be willing to back a no confidence vote in parliament. But Labour hope they might do so after Mrs May finally holds a vote on her Brexit deal and it fails in January.  The Labour leader scrapped a meeting with Scottish National Party Westminster chief Ian Blackford last night over the SNP’s “game-playing” over a no-confidence vote. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell insisted Labour will review every day whether to try and oust Theresa May. Pledging to keep plotting how best to remove Mrs May, Shadow Chancellor Mr McDonnell said: “We will judge it as we go on, it will be a fine judgement each day.” He added: “We will put one down when we can win it .. we are judging it literally day by day.” Meanwhile a shadow Brexit minister was forced to backtrack after suggesting the vote would happen by Christmas. Jenny Chapman told LBC: Its gonna happen. Its on its way. I think the vote of confidence will probably come before Santa doesI can put it that way. But after Labour sources insisted the policy had not changed, she hastily backtracked: Might have got a bit carried away trying to make a joke about Christmas! Labour is prepared to bring a no confidence vote and will do so at the best opportunity to topple this rotten Government. There is a clear process for holding a no confidence vote in Parliament.  If more than half of MPs vote no confidence in the government, it has  days to restore order - or there is an automatic general election. Anyone can submit a no confidence motion - but the convention is it is only found debating timelaid by Mr Corbyn. Contrary to suggestions, he can force as many no confidence votes as he wants. But Parliamentary experts argue this would stretch the convention that they are only used when really necessary. Mr McDonnell also accused the SNP of trying to dodge a general election because it would lose seats to Labour.  The SNP wants a second Brexit referendum - and unionists fear thatthe SNP is successful in demanding another EU vote, it will inevitably lead to a fresh referendum on Scottish independence. “All the SNP wants is to avoid a general election. Thenthey pressurise for another referendum on whatever, then they destablise the country to get a referendum in their own country, in Scotland - that’s what this is all about,” he said. “Their tactic is obvious, isn’t it  To press for a vote of no confidence that would potentially lose, that would mean therefore we can’t get a general election. “They are terried of a general election. I was up in Scotland this weekend - they are sitting on a large number of marginal seats at the moment, and we will take them. “Thenthey can’t get a general election they will press for a ‘people’s vote’ and, I think, opportunistically, that then opens an element of destability in Scotland because they will then press for a second referendum. “It’s an obvious strategy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"gran saved foodbank now helping","story":"NewsGran saved by foodbank is now helping others survive Universal Credit miseryEXCLUSIVE: Former nurse Shirley Ilfield is using her experience to help families navigate through the miseryShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  DEC NewsShirley Ifield now volunteers at a food bank in Peckham \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCome and have a sit down, my love,” says Shirley Ifield, ushering a pale, thin young woman to a chair in a brightly painted room. “Do you want a cuppa  Help yourself to a mince pie. Now, how are you today ” “Oh God,” sighs the woman, fighting back tears. “I’m just so, so stressed.” “I know,” says gran-of-three Shirley, softly. “I understand. But you’ve come to the right place and I’m going to help you.” Twenty minutes later, the single mum of two is leaving the Pecan foodbank in Southwark, South London, with three carrier bags of groceries, nappies and toiletries. She will be able to give her kids three decent meals a day for the next three days, and knows they will also get enough food for Christmas and some treats. But she has been given far more than a free food handout.   After months of despair, the mum has got help shyunravelling the Universal Credit nightmare that left her hungry and desperate. Caring volunteer Shirley knows exactly how that feels. She was in the same boat  months ago. The former nurse, , had to turn to the foodbank after losing her job and her home and then getting caught up in the Government’s chaotic welfare reforms. Now, she is using her experience to help others feed their families and find a way through the misery. “I’d worked hard all my le and paid my taxes and never dreamed that I’d have to rely on a foodbank,” says Shirley. “But I ended up sick, jobless and homeless in the space of a month. Then moving on to UC left me in debt and pushed me to the brink. “Now I’m in a position to pay back the help I got, but I’m still angry this broken system is failing so many families and children.” This Christmas, we are shyasking readers to back our End Hunger, Feed A Family appeal and raise funds for The Trussell Trust.   It is the country’s largest provider of foodbanks, and expects to give out more than , food parcels in December, providing . million meals to starving families. Because the Tories’ disastrous welfare reforms have sparked a % surge in demand nationwide. In Southwark, one of the first boroughs in the UK to introduce UC three years ago, the misery caused by the benefits scandal is shockingly apparent. Southwark’s foodbank, based at the Pecan charity in Peckham, which is part of the Trust network, saw a % rise in demand last year and a similar spike in . CEO Chris Price says at least % of the increase is due to UC. Clients are referred, with vouchers, by frontline care professionals like GPs, teachers, church groups, MPs and the Citizens Advice Bureau. Chris, , says: “When we first opened we had a cupboard with a few shelves of emergency supplies. “Now, we have a warehouse and last year we fed , people with  tonnes of food donated by the public. As a society, we should be helping people who are living on the breadline to rise above it. But at this foodbank we are simply taking people up to the breadline.” Foodbank manager Simon Boxall, , is in the warehouse with volunteers sorting the cans, bottles and boxes from the latest collection at a local supermarket. But the former primary school teacher would be happierhis job did not exist. “We are sailing into a situation where foodbanks are an accepted part of the welfare state,” he says. “That’s what I get really angry about.” In an office across the road, Shirley is talking to a steady stream of desperate clients struggling to feed their families.  Like ex-soldier and single dad Barry, . He spent nine years in the Army, serving in Bosnia and Kuwait, then was a security guard. But five years ago his partner walked out and he had to give up work to care for his daughter, now eight. His benefits were switched to UC and he says delays put him suddenly in debt. He says: “The first time I came here, I felt I’d let myself down. I’m really grateful and glad they are here because they treat you like a human being. “But I want to provide for my daughter, not rely on charity. I’ve used up all my savings, now I just want to get back to work, graft for the next  years and save some money to leave her. “It’s been hard – more stressful than serving in a war zone.” Shirley comes in with the bags of food that volunteers have put together to see Barry and his daughter through the next three days. Then she goes to deal with the next client, and is able to say, “I know what you’re going through”. Shirley says: “In  I injured my back while working in a private care home and had to stop work. “My flat went with the job so I lost that, too. I had to sofa-surf at my daughter’s until I got a hostel and then I went to a support unit. “I was on ESA [Employment and Support Allowance] and PIP [Persshyonal Independence Payshyment], I paid my own rent and had no debt, I went back to college to train as an aromatherapist and began doing voluntary work. “Then I got a council house here in Southwark, which was just rollshying out UC.” Shirley, too, found herself in debt as she did not get money for three months.   She says: “My mental health was beginning to suffer but I wasn’t getting any help or advice from the jobcentre, then I got an eviction letter. I went to the CAB and was told about the foodbank. “I felt terrible when I first came, but they made me feel so welcome and at ease. And I saw all the people with young kids here and I realised it wasn’t my fault. “I thought, ‘They’re here to help, take the help’ and I did, for three months. They helped me get back on my feet while I sorted my debt.” Shirley adds: “I am still on UC – I don’t get signed off until after I have back surgery – but I started volunteering here a month ago. “I can tell clients, ‘I’ve been there’, and they know someone understands what they are going through the fear of being evicted, of not having enough to eat. “Sadly, more and more schools are referring families here because teachers can see children aren’t eating. Doctors, too. It breaks my heart sometimes.

The Prime Minister begged EU leaders to bail her out of a mounting crisis as she desperately tried to win changes to her Brexit deal to buy off Tory rebels. It came amid frenzied speculation at Westminster that Mrs May faces a fresh bid from Brexiteers to oust her from Number . Senior Tory sources claimed that the  letters needed to kick off a no confidence vote in the PM had been reached - putting her premiership in jeopardy. EU president Jean-Claude Juncker dealt a heavy blow to the PM’s plans when he said there was “no room whatsoever” for re-opening talks. In a Brussels speech, he added: “There is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.”  European Parliament leader Guy Verhofstadt added that it was “out of the question” to renegotiate the controversial Irish backstop. Mrs May faced more embarrassment when she was stuck in her car for twelve agonising seconds while Angela Merkel stood waiting on a red carpet ahead of their Berlin meeting. Afterwards, the German Chancellor further undermined the PM’s plans when she said there was “no way to change” the deal. The PM also met Dutch leader Mark Rutte for breakfast in the Hague and later travelled on to Brussels for talks with EU Council President Donald Tusk, who tweeted after: Clear that EU wants to help. The question is how. Mrs May insisted she was “just at the start of the negiotiations” with the EU to secure “further assurances” about the Northern Ireland border plan to get backing from MPs.  “What I am discussing with European leaders and what I’ll continue discussing with them is how we can provide assurances that the backstop in Northern Ireland, were it to be used, that it will only be temporary,” she said. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom said the PM was seeking a “legally binding” change, understood to include Parliament getting a vote after a year on whether the Irish backstop should stay in place. But senior Tories fear her diplomatic tour was pointless because EU leaders do not believe she is not serious about her threat of crashing out of the EU without a deal. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn labelled Mrs May the “runaway prime minister” and slammed the trip for being a “waste of time and public money”. The PM’s scramble round European capitals follows her humiliating decision to shelve her Brexit vote on Monday to avoid a crushing Commons defeat. Downing Street confirmed that the vote will happen before January  - leaving Britain stuck in Brexit chaos over Christmas. Amid swirling rumours that the PMs leadership was on the brink, friends of Tory backbench chief Sir Graham Brady claimed the  letters had not been reached. But other senior Tory sources later insisted they had. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith hinted that even he could push for a no confidence voteMrs May failed to secure a legally binding exit clause to the backstop. Brexiteer Steve Baker, who has already submitted a letter, told the BBC: “The only way to change the policy is to change the Prime Minister. I really think it’s her duty now to go. It came as former Tory PM Sir John Major issued a plea to “stop the clock” on Brexit until the country had decided how it should quit the EU -at all. “Whether a Remainer or a Leaver, no-one welcomes chaos, he said in a speech in Dublin. “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that... we need to revoke Article  with immediate effect. The clock must be stopped.”  Government insiders admitted they had considered bringing forward the Christmas recess by a week to avoid Labour staging a no confidence vote in the government. One cabinet source said: “If we could pull it off, why wouldn’t we  It kills any motion of no confidence next week.” But Tory whips admitted the plan, which would need a vote to proceed, would fail as MPs would be nervous about disappearing off on holiday during a time of national crisis. The PM’s spokesman denied as “categorically untrue” claims she told EU leaders of her plan to scrap the meaningful vote she was doomed to lose before she told her own Cabinet. He also rejected suggestions that an addendum to the withdrawal agreement had already been drafted. The PM today [WEDS] faces her weekly grilling at Prime Minister’s Questions at noon, before hosting Cabinet in Downing Street. After that, she jets to Dublin for crunch talks with Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar, then flies to Brussels ahead of tomorrow’sEU Council summit.

The -year-old, known as the Beast of Bolsover for his uncompromising style, mouthed the insult at Glasgow South MP Stewart McDonald during the debate.

The world in  would once have been imagined with cities in the sky, flying cars and commuter jet-packs. And while our reality is not quite as science fiction as past predictions, it is a pretty clever one. Over the past  years, innovation and invention has quietly shaped how we live and work – with the continuing evolution of smart home connected appliances, lighting and heating systems, and even smart meters. Smart meters are not only an easy tool to track energy use in the home, but the smart meter rollout will support the country in adapting to new, greener ways of generating energy, such as wind or solar power.  Smart meters will also help to inform the smart grid about real time energy usage and will facilitate a sht towards a cleaner, flexible system for a more energy efficient future. More efficient energy use is not the only smart development we can look forward to within our homes. The majority of households in the UK have access to the internet and this is paving the way to a smarter, more connected way of le. What impact has digital tech already had on our homes   In the last four years there has been a surge in smart TV purchases, with almost half of the UK’s population now owning one – allowing us to watch what we want, when we want. But it’s not just entertainment that has been impacted by digital tech – you can get connected devices to help you do all sorts of tasks in the home. We have automated vacuum cleaners, remote video security cameras, robotic lawnmowers, voice-activated lighting systems, app controlled heating systems and smart meters, which show exactly how much energy you are using in pounds and pence, via an in-home display.  All of these are relatively recent innovations that eventhey had been showcased  years ago, would have seemed more science fiction than science fact. “In the past few years, we’ve seen more progress in some areas than in previous decades combined,” explains Alice Bonasio, consultant and Editor-in-Chief of Techtrends.tech. “Experts in fields such as immersive tech, articial intelligence and robotics are constantly having to revise their predictions about when things will cross that threshold between conceptual and actionable. “The ones who prepare for it and embrace the change have a huge opportunity here.” How are digital systems being used by the healthcare industry - and what are the plans for the future   Not only will smart meters contribute to a greener, more cost- effective home set-up, some initial studies have suggested that by sharing energy use data, smart meters could help with in-home care of the vulnerable and elderly by non-invasive monitoring. This could be especially beneficial in flagging unusual behaviour patterns with older people who live alone.

Jayden Burdern, aged , Riley Gaffney, aged , and -year-old Reigan Gaffney ‘wreaked havoc’ on Congleton, in Cheshire. But the trio, who are all from Crewe, have now been handed two-year criminal behaviour orders . They are banned from hanging around with a number of other youths in the Crewe area They are also not allowed to travel on public transport without an adult. They have also been handed three-month curfews meaning they must stay in their homes between pm and am, reports Stoke-on-Trent Live.   The -year-old ringleader – who cannot be named for legal reasons – has been sentenced to four months at a youth detention and training centre. Residents in the town have recently been subjected to a rampage involving  yobs, who threw eggs, ripped up flower beds and spat at victims. However, it is not knownthe four were involved in those incidents.Inspector Penny Jones, fromCheshire Police, said: “These youths wreaked havoc in Congleton for a number of weeks, targeting other youths and invoking fear and intimidation with people caught up in their wake. “I hope that these punishments handed out by the court provides reassurance to local residents. “I also hope that it sends out a very strong message that despite these boys being juveniles they are not above the law and this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated. “I would like to thank the members of the public who provided information to the police to allow us to tackle these matters robustly.”   The CBOs were issued at Crewe Magistrates’ Court after Congleton Beat Team, Crewe Beat Team and Cheshire East Councils Anti-Social Behaviour Team took action following a number of reports of anti-social behaviour in the those areas. Sergeant Andy Baker, from the Crewe Beat Team, said: “The behaviour of this group of youths was totally unacceptable and I welcome the punishments that they have been given.   “We will continue to work closely with our partners to take robust action against those who persistently cause misery to members of our community with this kind of behaviour. “I urge anyone who witnesses any of the boys breaching their orders to report it directly to us.” Councillor Janet Clowes, Cheshire East Council cabinet member for adult social care and integration, said: “These young people’s behaviour impacted on members of the public and we had no alternative but to seek these Criminal Behaviour Orders alongside custodial sentencing for those that continue to persist with their offending.  “We hope the orders assist these young people by giving them the boundaries they need to improve their behaviour. In the case of a young person, taking a criminal case is always a last resort and our officers both within Cheshire Constabulary and Cheshire East Council have spent a considerable amount of time over several years to support everyone involved. “However, there has to be a point at which we say, enough is enough, our residents have the right to live in peace and without fear and we must protect them from iniduals who don’t respect this.

A study exploring how family food trends have changed over the decades found our palettes still crave many of the same flavours we enjoyed decades ago. Other family meals which have stood the test of time include fish and chips, shepherd’s pie and jacket potato. And modern parents reckon a third of the meals they feed their kids are the same or similar to the ones their parents gave them when they were children. Food historian Monica Askay, acting as spokesperson for cooking appliance brand, Belling, which commissioned the study, said: “Food is and has always been subject to fashion. Our food choices are influenced by so many things including social factors, the availability of ingredients, foreign travel, immigration, celebrity chefs, advances in technology, changing health advice, and food scares.  “Food of the s was still much influenced by the -year period of rationing during and following WW. “The preferred style of eating was very much ‘meat and two veg’ - traditional British dishes. “Over the decades our tastes have become much more cosmopolitan, and we have also reduced our meat consumption. “The research shows that despite the large range of dishes and available ingredients we do tend to stick to a fairly small number of favourite dishes, and that many of these have remained preferred throughout the decades.” The study also found our favourite modern family meal is Spaghetti Bolognese, rising from relative obscurity in the s to become a family staple. Spag bol – which is currently the most popular choice with families in  – couldn’t crack the top  meals back in the s, according to the survey.  Though by the s the meal had become the fth most popular family dinnertime dish. Pizza has also experienced a meteoric rise over the last  years. While rarely invited to the dinner table in the s, pizza became the tenth most popular family meal of choice in the s, and became the top dinner staple throughout the s, according to the survey. Monica explained the appeal of Italian foods: “The rise in popularity of Italian dishes is interesting and quite complicated as it is due to a number of factors. Over the years, there has been migration to the UK from Italy and this led to the many influences on our food. This has included ice cream and ice cream parlours, s coffee bars and the opening of restaurants like Spaghetti House and trattorias. “This, alongside rising numbers of British people holidaying abroad and dietary advice stating a third of your meal should be carbohydrate and citing pasta as a great source of this added to its popularity. “In later years, the increased availability of pasta in shops and supermarkets, rise of Italian ready meals, and popularity of celebrity chefs who are passionate about the cuisine have helped cement Italian meals as some of the nation’s favourites.  Pizza has many American influences and was helped to fame by the opening of chain pizza restaurants across the UK.” The Sunday roast, which was consistently the most popular family meal throughout the s and s, has steadily been replaced by other alternatives since the s, and now sits in sixth place in the rankings. Seventy five per cent of modern parents still believe it is important for their family to eat dinner together each evening, and the average family will manage to get together for a meal four times a week. Fty five per cent of those surveyed consider family mealtimes the highlight of their day. And three in  think their kids prefer classic meals which have stood the test of time over more modern, trendier cuisine. Two thirds of parents think there is more pressure on them to feed their kids healthy, balanced meals than there was on their own parents decades ago. Though almost a third of parents believe their kids are less interested in eating healthy food than they were when they were children themselves, according to the OnePoll study.  A spokesperson for -year-old cooking appliance maker, Belling, said: “We commissioned this research to find out how much things like trends and new diets had impacted on family favourite foods. “But whilst fashion, music and culture has shted in the last  years, we still crave the tastes of our childhoods. “Belling has been at the heart of the family home for over  years, so whilst we know that there are some consistent family favourites which have really stood the test of time, it has been interesting to see dishes which we now consider synonymous with family mealtimes rising from relative obscurity, like everyone’s favourite Spag Bol, to take the top spot in our chart.” THE NATION’S FAVOURITE FAMILY MEALS .

Children as young as  have been arrested for selling the zombie drug, often to homeless addicts. A Mirror investigation found the Spice epidemic sweeping Britain has reached terrying levels. It comes as Prince William spoke out against the drug as he visited a homeless shelter yesterday. Cynical gang bosses are making thousands of pounds a year by using youngsters to peddle their misery since the former legal high was criminalised in . Ex-addict Phillip Hartley has been trying to highlight the shynightmare of Spice, which leaves users in a trance-like state, in his home town of Doncaster, South Yorks.   The -year-old, who works with the homeless, told how he sees shychildren running the drug frequently. Phillip said: “I see it every day, these kids flying around on their pushbikes going from beggar to beggar with Spice. They’re being groomed into thinking the big, hard-man le is cool. I’m trying to make my town safe for my three kids and teach these kids it’s cool to care and be compassionate. Spice is an epidemic in this country.” The -year-old arrested was held in London last year, according to a Freedom of Information request. The youngest held in shyLeicestershire was  and in Greater Manchester . The Children’s Society has also seen a rise in the number of children dealing drugs. Greater Manchester area manager Joanna Hunt said dealers target vulnerable youngsters who have often suffered trauma. She added: “Younger and younger children being exploited. “Earlier this year there was a nine-year-old boy dealing in cannabis five minutes from his school. “Perpetrators are clever at getting into the heads of young people.

Young people don’t face the same sanctions, they are less likely to be jailed so are more likely to take risks in a street market.”  Prince William spoke about Spice on a trip with Kate to a Central London hostel run by homeless charity The Passage. He said: “The fact it was a legal high and it has led to such shyaddiction is just terrible.” Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, added: “There was real empathy that came from the duke and duchess. I think they shyappreciated hearing first-hand the terrible effects of Spice. I think they were shocked.” Dr Ralphs said the Spice epidemic started in prisons and has now spilled onto the streets. In a study behind bars he found the smoking ban in jails has fuelled the problem as inmates have turned to the cheap drug after the black market price of tobacco rocketed to pound a pouch. Spice, bought for as little as pound, is sprayed on anything from letters to drawings and smuggled inside. Dr Ralphs added: “You’ve got people who would have been smoking rollies now smoking Spice.”A -year-old former inmate who tried the drug for the first time at  in jail said: “It’s really bad in prison.

Now it has emerged her best friend, known only as Sanaztt, has also gone to extreme s to alter her appearance. Together they can be seen posing in pictures on Instagram as they dance and mime to songs together. Sanaztt, who has more than , followers, also regularly posts pictures of her plumped up pout and ever changing hair colour.   In her most recent photos, she can be seen sporting blonde and pink dreadlocks right down to her waist. Meanwhile, Sahar also appears to have dramatically changed her appearance again. In her latest photographs, shes ditched her long brunette locks for bright green, orange and white wigs. She has also replaced foundation with white face paint. After going viral, Sahar reportedly claimed she had  surgeries and lost  kilos to get her distinctive look and mimic her idol.   But she attracted lots of criticism with many people comparing her looks to Tim Burtons the Corpse Bride and many doubtingher looks were real, or just the result of digital trickery. After causing a flurry of internet speculation Sahar appeared to confirm she had had cosmetic surgery but insisted she never wanted to look like A-lister Jolie. She told Russian website Sputnik News although she had some plastic surgeries, including rhinoplasty, liposuction and cosmetic procedures to give her fuller lips, her spooky looks were mostly down to make-up prosthetics and photoshop.   She also reportedly confirmed the suspicions of eagle-eyed social media users who claimed the photos were definitely digitally altered. She said: No. It is Photoshop and makeup. Every time I publish a photo I make my face more fun. It is my way of self-expression, a kind of art. My followers know that this is not my real face. I had no interest at all to be like Angelina Jolie, and I did not want to look like the character from Corpse Bride. I understand that I do have some similarities with them, but I am my own muse and I did not want to look like anyone. That was not my aim.

She shared two images, one is unedited and the other shows Sahar as her look-a-like alter ego.

The waxworks arrived for the holiday season at Madame Tussauds in the German capital on Tuesday. Unlike the museums usual wax figures, the new moving figures are actors wearing silicone masks modelled on their subjects features.  They decorate a tree, pose with visitors and gaze lovingly at each other. The museum unveiled a so-called live figure of U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which proved popular with visitors. And while Theresa May was refused further Brexit negotiations by German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Berlins chancellery, Harry and Meghan received compliments and applause.  They are the the latest attraction at the Berlin museum, located not far away from the Brandenburg Gate. Visitors had voted for Harry and Meghan as the next live wax figures performing at the museum, said Nina Zerbe, spokesperson for Berlins branch of Madame Tussauds. Maybe an expecting royal couple is better news for Christmas than the looming Brexit and all the chaos that comes with it economically, Zerbe guessed.  Harry and Meghan are expecting their first child in the spring of , around a year after their glittering wedding injected Hollywood glamour into the royal family. And visitors as well as another royal guest were clearly charmed by the mother-to-be.  Xenia, Princess of Saxony, posed with the live wax couple for the cameras and said she felt very accepted by Britains royals. Like many other visitors she said she was worried about the looming Brexit chaos. I still hope they just forget about it and sweep it under the carpet, she said.  The Prime Minister postponed a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal on Monday to seek more concessions but the European Union refused to renegotiate and lawmakers doubted her chances of winning big changes. Mays abrupt move less than  hours before parliament was to vote opens up a range of possibilities from a Brexit without a deal to a last-minute agreement or another EU referendum.

And he couldnt believe his luck when he received the email announcing he had won a pound, ticket to the four-day orgy, which takes place from tomorrow on a private Caribbean island. A thrilled Brian said: “When I told my parents they were very angry. But then my dad researched about it and liked what he saw too. My dad wanted to come with me, but obviously he couldn’t. He’s given me the talk about sex and told me to be careful about catching diseases.”   The debauched vacation promises erotic bliss where men get unlimited sex and at least two ‘latina’ girls for every man. Last month organisers sent men into a frenzy by offering a chance to win a free golden ticket for the all-expenses-paid trip to the drugs and sex fest, where prostitutes outnumber men by two to one. They told how thousands had bought merchandise from their online store after announcing that each item would give the buyer one entry into the draw. And yesterday the golden ticket winner was revealed as Brian. His parents have now given him permission to attend the event after signing a permission slip as he is under .  The teen from Chile who joined his parents living in New York a month ago, said: “I bought a phone case and a bag for . After seeing the videos from Sex Island I just wanted to be there, but never imagined I would actually win. I used my dad’s credit card without telling him. “I received an email last week telling me I’d won the golden ticket. I couldn’t believe what I was reading, I thought I was dreaming. “My mum hasn’t spoke to me since she found out about it. Although his mum is still against the trip, Brian says he will be taking a plane today to travel to Piarco International Aiport in Trinidad and Tobago, where his dream trip begins.   From there, the group of  men will be taken to the docks, where a luxury yacht will transport them to the mystery island, according to organisers the Good Girls Company. The orgies begin as soon as the yacht begins the two-hour journey, one of last year’s participants revealed last month. Brian said: “I can’t sleep properly waiting to go, and thinking about how it will be. “I want to have sex for the first time. Losing my virginity is really important to me at this time in my le.   “I have tried to find girls on Tinder, but never had the courage to meet up with them in case it’s not really them in the photo. I kissed a friend in school once but she didn’t want anything  with me. “My friends are so so jealous of me. Last month, a tourist who visited the Sex Island last year lted the lid on what goes on at the debauched holiday. New York dentist Ryan, a married father-of-two, revealed how every customer chooses two girls who spend the entire holiday granted their every sexual desire.  He claimed drugs were freely available and every man was allowed an hour with  girls at once. Among new erotic attractions, this year will be games of golf, in which the winner of each game will get to have all the island’s  girls for  mins, strip tennis where each point the client gets the girl he is playing has to take off a piece of clothing. The mystery island resort will also have a “body table’ restaurant, where food will be served on top of women’s half-naked bodies, organisers said. On the Goods Girls Co website, the vacation is billed as turning “fantasies into reality”. The website explains that all the hookers have been tested and found to be free of STIs, promises “unlimited sex with two girls per day” and says that switching girls with other guests is permitted.  It reads: “The event is on our private island. Enjoy the company of  beautul latina girls,  hot DJ’s streaming the most exciting music all day and night, and a drug-friendly environment. “All the girls are here to please you and make you feel like a king,you have any special fantasy make sure to inform the host, or the girls and they will make sure to bring them to le. “All our girls are tested and free of any sexual disease. There is also a very strict condom policy rule, and of course, an unlimited amount of condoms. “Party with our girls in our luxury yacht, have fun with jet skis, volleyball court, and of course breathtaking beaches in our sex island.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb321ba152.jpg ","title":"angus farmer transforms straw bales into a christmas delight","story":"Monikie farmer Fleur Baxter has brought Christmas cheer to the countryside with a festive display.Mrs Baxter, of East Skichen Farm, got spray paint out to transform the straw bales, which has gone down a storm with commuters.It all started in  when Mrs Baxter decided to adorn some bales with ious Minions characters.They were such a hit on social media that she went on to create further works of art including Pokemon-themed characters, a giant Pudsey, a series of emojis and Dennis and Gnasher.She said she’s been delighted by the positive feedback from her Christmas display.Mrs Baxter said: “Drivers are smiling and people turn up for a selfie.

And now the European Cup semi-finals, the first game would be in Italy against AC Milan, and The Courier the morning after the game described it as ugly and rough.“In thegame at Dens, Alan Gilzean was sent off after eventually retaliating against the brutal attacks on him from Milan players.“It was an exit of frustration for Dundee FC from the European Cup and it stripped naivety from all Dundee football fans in the belief that this sport should be played in the spirit of fair play by both teams, and that referee decisions would be unbiased and judicious.”Rob concluded: Some years ago, I would frequent a watering hole called The Saracens Head, and among the patrons were a couple of lads who hailed from north London.“They were Spurs fans. When they described the on-field exploits of Alan Gilzean, it was with awe and reverence.“And, after a few cocktails, one of them would burst into a song that was sung at White Hart Lane that hailed Gilzean and Chivers.“Much has been written about Alan Gilzean, but not enough can be said.“One of the great front men to come out of Scotland with  caps.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blether ex dundee and dundee united man jimmy borland left school after select match","story":"Jimmy Borland is a regular contributor to this column and, indeed, also to the Tele letters page.No mean goalkeeper in his day, he is well known as a long-time goalie in the juniors, notably for North End and Lochee Harp.As a schoolboy at Stobswell Secondary School, he was chosen to represent the Dundee Schoolboys U  Select in .Said Jimmy: “This team beat Aberdeen - at the old St Joseph’s park in Gilburn Road, Kirkton, Dundee.“I was the reserve goalkeeper and actually left school after that game.“We had a good side and at least four players had trials for senior clubs.”Jimmy has sent in a photo of the select squad, which is featured below .Back row– Martin , D Sharp , I Sharp , Coull , Neish , Borland , Higgins , Cullen .Front row – Cochrane , Ky , Stirling , Gearie , Hay , Breslin , Wallace .As well as stints at Montrose and Raith Rovers, Gordon Wallace would go on to play and coach at Dundee United.He also played for, coached and managed Dundee, in addition to spells at other clubs."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb282c4b19.jpg ","title":"cat who disappeared from carnoustie turns up in arbroath two and a half years later","story":"A long-lost cat has been reunited with his family nearly two and a half years after he went missing – having turned up in a dferent town.Fudge, an -year-old tabby, was found wandering the streets of Arbroath after disappearing from his Carnoustie home in August .His owner, Andy Rowe, , an insurance broker, was shocked when he got a call on Sunday from Arbroath and Carnoustie Cats Protection Adoption Centre to say his pet had been found.Andy, who lives with his children Luke, , and Jack, , said: “We lost him two years and four months ago when we ed from a wedding and couldn’t find him.“He just vanished – we shouted and shouted but he didn’t reappear.“We put pictures of him on Facebook and went round dferent places to seehe was there.”After two years of no news about Fudge, the family didn’t expect to see him again.

We can’t take our foot off the gas and it was disappointing.“Look, I’m sure all the boys have experienced heavy defeats before and it’s not nice but, as the manager’s been saying, it’s about how you react.“The manager’s been brilliant at saying ‘look that’s us drawn a line under it’ and all our focus has been on getting back to winning ways and trying to get some positivity about the place and smiles on the boys faces again.“If we can go and win three or four games in a row then, hopefully, that result will be forgotten about.”And Booth feels the timing of their blip is a positive because there is plenty of time left this season to recty it.Following the game in Greenock today, United face Inverness in the Highlands as they aim to close the six-point gap on Ayr.And Booth insists that is the intention, saying he does not want to go through the turmoil of play-off disappointment again after last term’s relegation with Partick.He added: “They’re hugely important, absolutely massive games, especially with the gap at six points just now, they’re vital games.“We’ve two tough away games in Morton and Inverness coming up but we’ve been playing quite well away from home this season so, hopefully, that can continue and we can keep picking up results and close the gap over the festive period.“No one would really want play-offs but we’ll see what happens. Ayr have, obviously, been flying and they’re doing really well and County are up there as well but we’ve managed to narrow the gap to kind of make it a three-horse race.“We just need to get back on the same kind of run we were on before last Friday night, we’d been playing really well and were getting all the praise.“Hopefully, coming up to Christmas and New Year, we can put another run together and I’m confident we can.”Looking ahead to the game at Cappielow today, Booth is well aware Morton will be hurting, too, and look to recover after last weekend’s - loss to Dunfermline.“It will be a tough game. Their results have been up and down this season, they have some really good results and then, like last Saturday, not so good.“They probably deserved to win the game up at Tannadice earlier in the season, I think we scored a rd-minute equaliser.“It’s going to be a hard game but one we’ve prepared for well this week and go into it confident.“We’re both going into it on the end of two shocking results last weekend so it’s going to be about who reacts best to that.“Hopefully, with the squad we’ve got and how hard we’ve been working, then we’ll be the team that comes out on top.”"},{"url":null,"title":"long awaited us takeover of dundee united moves closer","story":"Rumours the long-awaited Dundee United takeover is nearing completion are growing.So far there has been no statement from either the Tangerines nor the prospective new owners – believed to be American-based businessmen – but it has been suggested a deal to buy the shareholding of chairman Mike Martin has been agreed.Martin controls just over % of the stock and that means new owners would also need at least some of the shares of his fellow director Jim Fyffe who has around %.Their shareholdings were confirmed in a list lodged at Companies House in Edinburgh recently.There had been speculation new owners would be confirmed last week and although that didn’t happen, it does now seem change at the top could be on the way.It’s understood United are set clary whether or not the deal is going ahead at some point in the next few days.Talks with the Americans have been ongoing since last year and originally a deal was expected to be done during the summer.When that didn’t happen, former chairman Stephen Thompson sold his majority stake to Martin and Fyffe in a deal that also involved investment from two other United-minded parties who preferred to remain anonymous.All along, though, Martin has insisted the discussions with the Americans have been progressing, albeit at a slower pace.Indications are they’re now complete and it is simply a matter of satisfying legal requirements before fans find out who will be leading their club for the foreseeable future."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/12/5c0fb27e9a517.jpg ","title":"staff donate toys sweets and games for dundee kids in need","story":"Hillcrest has teamed up with charity Togs for Tots to Teens to donate a sleigh load of gts to children suffering poverty.Staff came together to quickly build up a haul of toys, sweets and games to be packaged into shoe boxes and gt bags, which were then handed over to the organisation.Togs engages with families who are struggling most and believes that every child should have the opportunity to develop positively.As part of the initiative, the gts it receives from the public are distributed to those who are most in need in order to make Christmas a little more special for those who may have otherwise missed out.Some of the items donated by kind-hearted Hillcrest staff included dolls and teddies, toy cars, yo-yos, skipping ropes, puzzles, stationery, items of clothing, toiletries and sweets.Hillcrest fundraising officer Clare McNally said: “By generating a large amount of gt items and organising these into shoe boxes and gt bags, we hope to bring Christmas to those who have the least and are struggling most.”"},{"url":null,"title":"swansea city eye up move for dundee midfielder glen kamara","story":"Swansea City are eyeing up a move for Dundee’s star midfielder Glen Kamara, the Tele can reveal.The English Championship side were linked with a move for the Finnish international last summer, among a host of others.And with the -year-old available to sign on a pre-contract in January as he moves into the final six months of his contract, the Welsh club have stepped up their interest.Manager Graham Potter had a scout in attendance at Dens Park for Dundee’s impressive -

It’s up to Frank Lampard and the gaffer here.“I’m really enjoying my time here. It was meant to be six months.“The left-back therehas picked up an injury, which changes things a bit but we’ll see what happens.”During Lowe’s time with Aberdeen, Lampard has been keeping a close eye on the player’s performances for the Reds.He added: “Frank Lampard rang me after the League Cup final and thought I did well.“He said the boys were unlucky, which we were because the performance was there, we just didn’t get the result.“Him or Jody Morriscontact me after games and speak about what I did well and what I need to improve on.“It’s similar to the gaffer here. He’s the first to come to me and say ‘you did that well, but you didn’t do this well’.“Then we go into training and work on it straight away because I need to improve my game while I’m here.”Tonight Aberdeen look to move back into the Premiership’s top six following Saturday’s - defeat to St Johnstone by leapfrogging Livingston with a win against the Lions at Pittodrie.It’s the fourth of nine games in a hectic December for the Dons. With five home games before the Premiership’s winter break in January, Lowe wants to take advantage and gather plenty of points to move up the table.“It’s a great opportunity for us, especially with a lot of games at home,” he said.“We need to take advantage of these home games. We take it game by game and move on from Saturday quickly and try to win this game.“It’s been really annoying, losing on Saturday, because we have been trying to find that consistency of winning games. But we can’t seem to get a run going.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

We have ended up with the worst of all possible outcomes, with England and Wales voting to leave and leaving, Northern Ireland voting to remain and retaining a foothold into the EU and Scotland who voted to remain being completely dragged out against its will.No one should fall for this  choice being desperately spun by this isolated Tory Prime Minister, that seeks to force us to choose between a #bad deal# or a #no deal# at all.Brendan O#Hara MP, Argyll and ButeSir,We expect over  schools to be represented at next year’s Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships, based on the number of school pupils being taught in programmes run by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust .The trust now has projects going in  council areas supporting lessons to over , young people.We are getting a large number of enquiries from schools wanting to come along to the event on March  in Livingston.SSPDT aims to safeguard our wonderful musical traditions and to help young people develop skills for le, learning and work, with a focus on deprived and remote areas, by helping to introduce piping and drumming tuition to state schools on a par with orchestral instruments.We established the championships in  to offer a positive and friendly experience for players who are new to competition, and as a forum for bands at the very top of their game.The trust has resources to support more state schools in Scotland to introduce piping and drumming tuition, and we invite local education authorities, teachers and parents to contact us.All enquiries can be made via our website sspdt.org.ukAlexandra Duncan, chief executive, Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums TrustSir,Having campaigned extensively for the re-opening of the A after a landslide in October, I welcome Cabinet Secretary Michael Matheson’s commitment to identying a permanent solution to disruption on the road, whilst continuing to invest in shorter term mitigation measures.Closures to the A lead to untenable ersions and re-routing of traffic onto other roads, which is why is absolutely essential for permanent measures to be put in place to end these closures.The safety of the people who use this road has always been the top priority for the Scottish Government, and I am grateful to all those who have been involved in working towards a practical solution to make this road accessible for local people, visitors and businesses in my constituency.Michael Russell MSP, Argyll and ButeSir,The withdrawal agreement with the European Union has now been published.Our industry has consistently called for clarity over what that UK’s new relationship with the EU will look like in practice, particularly on the continued protection of geographical indications, customs procedures and future trade policy.The provisions set out in the withdrawal agreement provide us with a credible foundation on which to build in the next phase of the negotiations, during which a number of critical issues remain to be resolved.A no-deal Brexit would cause the Scotch whisky industry considerable dficulties and would force cost and complexity into production, distribution and exporting.  The withdrawal agreement is a compromise, but it is a positive step towards much needed business certainty.Karen Betts, chief executive, Scotch Whisky AssociationSir,I am struck by the comments of Theresa May that her Brexit plan will stop EU migrants #jumping the queue# when it comes to working in the UK.How low the UK has sunk that its Brexiteer government is now resorting to spreading resentment towards European citizens, classing them as #queue jumpers#. These iniduals took no part in this mess and work here legally and contribute to the country in so many dferent ways.They have the same general right of freedom of movement that allows British people the opportunity to work in Berlin and Paris, or retire in Spain.Even so, their reward seems to be an increasingly hostile atmosphere. Ms May makes no mention of those British #queue jumpers# in other EU countries, symptomatic no doubt of the same attitude that classes those Brits abroad as #expats#, while those from the other EU countries who come to work here are #immigrants#, an increasingly negative term.Since the referendum in  there has been an alarming increase in both veiled and more explicit verbal abuse to EU nationals, and this will no doubt increase as the negative impacts of Brexit become clearer and scapegoats will be required. Step forward those innocent EU nationals in our midst.The UK has taken a wrong turn, as exhibited by the dog-whistle politics of Theresa May and her Tory government.As the UK enters full panic mode, the victim of a bitter and corrupted Etonian gamble gone very wrong, we must do all that we can to support those EU nationals in our midst and defy this vile populist rhetoric.Alex Orr,  Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"luke naisby named red stars new manager","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowAccomplished defender Luke Naisby is Lochgilphead Red Star AFC#s new manager.The new manager#s first challenge was to take charge of Red Star against Ferguslie Star AFC on Saturday November  in Paisley.The Red Star Facebook page said: #The committee is delighted to welcome him to his new role with the club.

No wonder he looked nervous.The boys got to grips with the dferent handling characteristics of Willie Senior#s car and started to up the pace in the afternoon bringing the car home in a respectable th overall and third in class three. This result was enough to secure second position in the overall championship in class.Jamie Miller continued the learning process with the little Citroen C-RMax with Ian McCulloch pointing him in the right direction. A very neat rally from Jamie with very few mistakes saw him finish a creditable th overall and second in class two, only beaten by the Scottish Tarmac Champion for  Michael Harbour in his similar Citroen, who was only one place above him after seven stages.Innes Mochrie was once again out on the stages in the Mightyand this time he had someone whom he might listen to in the co-driver#s seat. His daughter, Kirsty, had elected to fill the silly seat for this event and they, after a few first stage detours, managed to keep speaking right to the end and brought the class one pocket rocket home in th overall and a brilliant second in class. The mind boggles as to what the result could have been , as Kirsty was heard to remark, she had #someone who would listen to her#.Jonothan MacDonald and Chris Wareham were out in the beautully prepared Mull of Kintyre Cheese sponsored Peugeot . Their pace was good enough for th overall and fourth in class three.Mull pair Malcolm MacDougall and Stuart MacLean were out in the class one Vauxhall Nova and were getting visibly quicker as the day went on, a trend that had repeated itself over the course of the year with confidence and technique increasing with every stage mile covered. They finished th overall and a commendable fourth in class one.There were three Argyll co-drivers directing their pilots around the airfield. Ian Parker, recently announced as one of seven # and the only Scot # co-drivers to be selected to join the MSA Academy for , was back in the Honda Civic of Fraser Smith. The Civic screamed its way round the stages with minimal fuss, other than perhaps a lucky trip on two wheels after clipping a tyre, to finish in nd overall and fourth in class two.The final Argyll man out was Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan who was shouting left and right for Greg Inglis of Montrose in his quick and agile Lotus Exige. Eoghan had been co-driver for Alan Kirkaldy in the earlier Granite Stages Rally, also held at Leuchars, and they had been first overall that day, so no pressure there, then.Greg found the Lotus was almost perfect for the stages on the day with a great balance of handling, braking and pace when needed. They were surprised, perhaps unjustly, to find out they were sitting well up the leader board after the first few stages.

The buildings on the main street and the front street just look sad.The front green for years has waited and unfortunately it still waits#this time for the council to clear away debris after a storm.Come on # the place looks bad enough. Clear it up as it happens or do something in the development plan to make sure it doesn’t in the future.Name and address supplied.What do you think about Lochgilphead and its future  Contact the Advertiser on editor@argyllshireadvertiser or message us directly via Facebook. Alternatively write to: Argyllshire Advertiser,  Argyll Street, Lochgilphead, Argyll, PA NBSir,As reported in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser, Christmas came early for local causes in Argyll recently when the Co-op revealed a £, festive funding boost.The money was shared by three organisations, all of whom are making a real dference to communities throughout the region. These are Argyll and Bute Youth Forum, Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation and Lochgilphead Phoenix Project, which wants to build an information point on the front green in Lochgilphead.This is the latest round of payouts from the fund generated by more than  , Co-op members in Argyll and Bute and means the Co-op has invested £, in nine groups in Argyll since the membership scheme launched in September .Co-op members, who receive a five per cent reward for themselves with a further one per cent going to local causes when they buy own-brand products, have a say in how the money is allocated, and are encouraged to select the organisations they wish to support online.Since the launch of the local community fund Co-op members have helped , organisations make a positive dference in their neighbourhoods and in the last  months alone £m has been invested in local causes.The fund is now supporting a wide iety of local organisations, from village halls and support groups to education providers and neighbourhood watch schemes, all of which are helping to make Argyll a better, happier, and healthier place to live.Rebecca Birkbeck, Co-op director of community engagement.Sir,I was pleased to attend the latest Argyll Islands Strategic Group meeting in Kilmory recently.I was able to speak to Scottish Government and Argyll and Bute Council representatives about the challenges facing our island communities.While we on the islands of Islay, Jura, Colonsay and Gigha are rightfully enjoying strong local economic growth, future growth will be stled by poor local infrastructure, at times unreliable ferry links and the never-ending troubles with the A.Regardless of what political stripe the leadership of the Scottish and UK parliaments have, all should be united in getting our vital links to the mainland and wider the UK economy back up to scratch.Without large scale investment from central government to fix Argyll and Bute#s roads and Transport Scotland#s trunk roads, our future prosperity is at risk and, as ever, it will be islanders that suffer the most.While political bun fights in the local press letters pages are entertaining,  what we really need is action from our MSPs and MPs.If we were talking about road and transport links between Scotland#s cities, it is highly likely these problems would already be fixed. The Scottish Government must in the future not be so urban-centric in its allocation of resources.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,I write following the release of the latest figures on alcohol use by the Office for National Statistics .The more you drink, the greater the long-term risk to your health and these ONS figures show a worrying increase in the number of alcohol-specic deaths in the UK, particularly amongst women and  to -year olds.From time to time, we are contacted by the families of people who have died as a result of alcohol and are only too aware of the heartbreak and utter sense of helplessness people feel when trying to lead someone to seek help for alcohol misuse.We must all do more to address the stigma that people feel in reaching out for support. For many of us, there are simple and effective ways for people to cut back on alcohol.Taking more drink-free days each week for example can reduce the overall amount of alcohol you drink and reduce the risk of developing serious illnesses. The Drinkaware website also provides information and resources for people concerned about their drinking or that of someone close to them and our DrinkChat online advisors can direct people, in complete confidence, to local treatment agencies.Elaine Hindal, Drinkaware chief executive."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead opens up for christmas","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe success of independent retailers depends on imagination and initiative, and Lochgilphead shops will be showing plenty of that # and festive spirit # in the weeks leading up to Christmas.Lochgilphead is, arguably, seeing a mini-revival, with new businesses outnumbering closures in recent times.

That kind of team confidence comes from having the care and understanding of first class management.The staging was deceptively simple and the backstage staff produced a delightful cart and car for Mr Toad, plus his horse, and the costumes were not elaborate while most effective.All were well-rehearsed, and the singing was clearly the result of very careful expert teaching. It was a great pleasure to see how some of the young voices have been developing since their last appearance in #The Wizard of Oz#.We would have liked a couple of the characters to project spoken parts more audibly but overall the clarity of words should be complimented.The energy of Mr Toad himself carried all before him, just as it is written in the script and the original Wind in the Willows.No inidual names are here mentioned, quite deliberately, as the outstanding impression of this show was the seamless blending of the entire team involved, with each and every participant a star in their own right."},{"url":null,"title":"camanachd association agm reports income rise","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Camanachd Association#s annual general meeting took place in the Muthu West End Hotel, Fort William, on Friday November .The  accounts showed a £, increase in turnover and a surplus of £,, increasing the association#s reserves to £, at December .Having fulfilled its obligations and met its related targets, the association did not suffer any reduction in its £, funding from Sportscotland, its largest single contributor.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire swimmer 67 proves age","story":"NewsAyrshire swimmer, , proves age is no barrier after scooping medal on debutHe finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:.ShareByGary Fanning:,  DEC NewsDundonald swimmer Sandy Mavor \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSwimmer Sandy Mavor proved age is no barrier as he claimed a bronze medal on his competitive debut at the Scottish National Masters m Championships. The -year-old finished the ‘swimming marathon’ at Tollcross in Glasgow in a very impressive .:. Sandy trains with the Masters squad at North Ayrshire Swimming at the Portal in Irvine after taking up the sport again when he retired seven years ago. “I swam at school a long time ago,” he explained. “I did the Loch Lomond  mile swim, and the Cumbrae to Largs in August, so I thought I’d try a pool swim. “The coaches here were brilliant here when I arrived. They couldn’t have been more welcoming and helpful - especially for refining my e off the starter blocks! “I think Masters is not quite so competitive so you can just go along and enjoy it. It’s good exercise and you get a good community and it keeps you fit and ticking over.” His first pool race didn’t go entirely to plan, it seems. “I got this racing ‘bullet cap’ and they told me to put another one underneath to stop it coming off, but it didn’t seem to work,” he laughs.  “I don’t know at what point I lost it but apparently I was in the lead for the first eight laps so maybe that was when it happened  I managed to retrieve it from the bottom of the pool at the end of the race, though, and I was very proud to be wearing the North Ayrshire cap.” Sandy’s success shows that swimming is a sport for all ages, with the benefits increasing as we get older as an ideal form of resistance training which is also kind to the joints. “It’s never too late,” said Sandy from Dundonald. “I speak to a lot of people who’ve never done crawl and they say ‘I could never do that’ but I’ve heard of beginners starting really quite late on in le. Initially they can’t swim onebut before they know it they’re swimming a mile. Once they’ve cracked the mental barrier they’re away.” Masters swimming is increasing in popularity, according to North Ayrshire’s head coach, Jess Wilkie. “It’s good for all ages to come down and meet new people and learn new skills, which you can’t beat,” she says. “We like to keep it ied and try and do a bit of everything to suit everyone from distance swimmers to those who want to come in and do a bit of technique work. “What we always say is that there’s a lane for everyone – it doesn’t matter what speed you swim, you can still participate. “I think the oldest swimmer we have is in her s and she’s still firing up and down the pool and matching younger guys.” “There are plenty of sessions to choose from whether you’re a morning person or prefer to exercise in the evenings.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13713656.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_CP43067514.jpg","title":"ayr united players pose inbetweeners","story":"NewsAyr United players pose as Inbetweeners stars on hilarious Christmas party nightHigh flying Ayr United hit the town with some of their squad bearing a resemblance to the cast of the Inbetweeners.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsAyr playersJames Hilton, Liam Smith, Daniel Harvie and Michael Rose\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheyre flying high in the Scottish Championship.

Reporter Hilary Scott went along to find out more...PRIORSFORD Primary School welcomed a new addition to the register this week, and she goes by the name of Peggy.As I signed in at the school, I note the reason for my visit as meeting Priorsfordrsquos new pupil who will be joining Mrs Sharprsquos P class.But Peggy isnrsquot your average pupil. In fact shersquos really quite unique in that shersquos furry, has four legs, a tail, and is the schoolrsquos very own puppy.So how did this adorable pooch make its way into the lives and hearts of the pupils and staff at Priorsford  Did the pupils ask for a puppy on their Christmas list this year I discovered that Peggy was actually on the wish list of teacher Caroline Sharpe, who approached headteacher Sandra Macgregor a year ago with the idea of a therapy dog for the school.Caroline explained: ldquoWe heard about therapy dogs and the benefits they bring to pupils, we wanted to tie it into our health and wellbeing in the school.ldquoI attended the SSPCA conference and there were people there from universities who had taken therapy dogs into final exams for students.ldquoEvidence shows that therapy dogs lower peoplersquos heart rate, gives a general sense of well-being and improves childrenrsquos socialisation skills. We visited a school in Midlothian who had a Cockapoo puppy and we knew we could make it work for us. She has changed the dynamic of the school.Peggy will live with Caroline, but will be in school full-time.Having settled into her new home at Priorsford Primary this week, Peggy is already the most popular pupil in school.Despite skipping five primary year-groups to join the P class, Peggy is at the very start of her journey to becoming a certied school dog.ldquoShe has settled in well and has already met the pupils at assemblies. My daughter is a vet and told me to expose her to everything straight away. The time between eight and  weeks is really important for stamping the personality and the secureness of the puppy, added Caroline.Peggy is learning how to become a listening dog, who will help children read aloud more confidently. She will put her head in their lap and listen without judgement, prompting them to turn a page with her paw.Caroline explained: ldquoNot only will she improve the pupilrsquos literacy skills, Peggy will be there for any children who are feeling anxious or worried, they can take some time out to talk to her.I joined the P class in the library as they read the tale of Greyfriars Bobby to Peggy. But she was worn out after a busy morning and childrenrsquos soothing reading put her to sleep!As I wander through the school with Peggy, pupils eyes widen at the sight of the furry bundle and instantly a smile lights up their faces. ldquoI love her Mrs Sharp, she is soooo cute, cooed one girl.When it came to naming the puppy, it was decided not to ask the children, who, Caroline said, would have come up with wonderfully unique suggestions.Before leaving the school, I am given Peggy to cuddle, and for a split second I consider slipping her into my handbag and making a run for it. But a vision of an angry mob in blue chasing me through the playground fills me with fear and I decide she is exactly where she should be.It is said that dog is a manrsquos best friend. But at this Peebles school, dog is the best friend of over  pupils who have become the proud owners of this gorgeous puppy Peggy, who has brought joy, happiness and love to her new home at Priorsford Primary."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":"This week Bosco Santimano, founder and executive director of social enterprise You Can Cook, shares his thoughts on organic farming.Most of us are already conditioned into believing the so called lsquomagicrsquo of science. That science has or will find solutions to all our manmade problems. The issue with this approach has always been that, experiments carried out in controlled environments like laboratories and then replicated in nature have always been unexpected and sometimes catastrophic.These scientic methods involved limited assessments and tests and mainly conducted for profit by big pharma!Having covered Making Scotland GMOFree in my previous column I will focus on our next vision, which is to make Scotland a  per cent organic country.The green revolution introduced in the s, sprayed fertilisers and pesticides on farm land all over the planet to increase crop yields. This in turn led to many forests being cut down to grow what was then called lsquocash cropsrsquo and small-scale farming was replaced by industrial farming on a massive scale supported by government subsidies.Big corporations acquired land across the globe, food was added as a commodity to be traded for profits on the stock market and this in turn has led to inequalities in health and access to food especially in developing and third world countries.The unforeseen impact of chemicals for growing over the last few decades, has led to the fall of nutrients in the soil, as this was being depleted by over use and irregular crop rotation. Profits were maximised and are even today. For example, soya beans are now grown in many countries as cattle feed for the West! This then leaves no arable land for the local population to grow food leading to widespread hunger and impoverished conditions.We need to go back to our roots and grow food at local levels on a small scale and bring back farming as a lucrative job for people to invest their time and energies. This will be a sustainable long-term approach and remove the need for farming subsidies that are the biggest scandal of our times as most go to big landowners in this country. Can you imagine governments are currently paying farmers in some cases not to grow Organic farming will not only bring back the health of the soil but also stop corporations making money through selling chemicals and hybrid seeds. This will have a positive impact on the lives of all people as lsquoorganic produce will no longer be the domain of the rich and middle class who can afford to feed themselves and their children with good food. This choice should be available to all.So! Whatrsquos happening globally where organic farming is concerned  Denmark is on its way to becoming the worldrsquos first  per cent organic country, followed by Bhutan and Estonia. India has the North-eastern state of Sikkim designated as the first fully organic state anywhere in the world and was awarded the UN lsquoOscar for the Best Policy that is inclusive and comprehensive of all socioeconomic aspects.Can Scotland be  per cent organic  Yes! It can."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-factory-announces-50-redundancies","story":"ONE of the regions major manufacturers has announced that it is looking to pay off more than  members of staff.Jedburgh-based Mainetti UK is looking for voluntary redundancies following a second year of reported losses.Bosses at the Oxnam Road coat-hanger manufacturer are blaming recycling and a reduction in high street retailers as well as an increase in the minimum wage for combined losses over the past  months of more than pound million.Mainettis Regional MD Jim Hutchison stated: \"The last two years have been dficult for the business.\"In  Mainetti UK Limited made a loss of pound, and this year we are forecast to lose a further pound,.\"The business is faced with an ever increasing cost base with increases in the National Minimum Wage, higher electricity costs and higher business rates.\"To add to these cost pressures the business is seeing local UK demand for hangers reducing.\"Many retailers are closing down shops or reducing their selling space and this means there are less hangers required.\"In addition, an increased emphasis on recycling means more hangers are being ed from stores for resorting, which further reduces manufacturing demand.\"Mainetti UK currently employs around  staff.Talks have already started with unions over the planned  redundancies.Mr Hutchison added: \"These changes will only impact the Jedburgh hanger manufacturing unit.\"All other products made in Jedburgh ndash flower buckets, polythene bags, Glastic and The Seatcase will not be impacted and in fact the company will continue to invest in all these areas during , in order to grow those parts of our Jedburgh manufacturing business.\"Local MP John Lamont has been in talks with the company over the past few days.He told us: ldquoThis is disappointing news from a long standing employer in Jedburgh.ldquoClearly their market is changing and Mainetti are having to adapt to that.

their Burnham on Sea microwave joke was worth the admission fee alone.These four crazy characters swayed towards slapstick, flirted with farce and brought down the house with a bombardment of belly-laughs.Despite all the fun and frivolity, though, Sleeping Beauty was still a sensational piece of stage theatre.Julia Noble and Steve Hartley-Oliver were authoritative and appealing as Queen Marigold and King Cactus.And the regular arrival of sinister Witch Hazel, played by both Tracey Borthwick and Julie Smith, in a cloud of customary green smoke made sure the young audience were kept on their toes.The couplet duels between the villainous Witch and Fairy Lilac, played exquisitely by Amanda Blacklock, were both clever and entertaining.Couplets aside, music was at the heart of Sleeping Beauty, from the opening Lazy Hazy Crazy Days of Summer all the way through the seasonal finale, and many of the most memorable numbers came from Fairy Lilac and her supporting coloured fairies of Shannon Mack, Ruby Everett, Caitlin Green and Katie Wilson.From You Can Do Magic and Dream a Little Dream of Me to the luscious Hushabye Mountain, Amanda and her young apprentices were wonderful.A beautul rendition of Born with a Smile on My Face was the highlight of Aimee Richardsons all-to-short appearance as Young Rose.And the childrens fun-filled version of Wake Up You Sleepy Head was also among the many highlights of a fantastic night of musical theatre.The songs came thick and fast - as did the jokes.Hawick, Melrose and Tweedbank were ridiculed regularly, as were Theresa May, the Ladhope Vale one-way system and the residents of Abbotsford Court.The laughs were loud and the cheers, especially when Braw Lad and Braw Lass Greg Kelly and Kimberley OMay turned up for Roses Christening, were even louder.The choreography was both imaginative and eye-catching with dancers Emma Wilson, Jess Thomson, Rachel Falconer and Sara Facchini having obviously put in the rehearsal hours.The score was foot-tappingly good, the scene changes were swt and the stage was picture perfect.But ultimately its the actors, dancers and singers who take a production to new heights.And when the cast is enjoying themselves as much as the audience, the people behind the Right Angle Theatre Company can go to sleep this Christmas with a smile on their faces.CASTFairy Lilac: Amanda BlacklockWitch Hazel: Julie Smith Tracey BorthwickMuddles: Billy RooneyKing Cactus: Steve Hartley-OliverQueen Marigold: Julia NobleNurse Hettie Harpic: Jodie MillarFetch: Antony WilsonCarrie: Katie GordonFairy Red: Shannon MackFairy Yellow: Ruby EverettFairy Green: Caitlin GreenFairy Blue: Katie WilsonYoung Rose: Aimee RichardsonPrince Alexis: Stuart MitchellRose: Amy ThomsonDancers: Sara Facchini, Rachel falconer, Jess Thomson and Emma Wilson.Chorus: Ruaridh Anderson, Charli Black, Tracy Borthwick, Callum Crooks, Erin Gallagher, Nicole Hughes, Mya Lamb, Molly McFarlane, Lee-Anne Robinson, Millie Robinson, Ally Turnbull, Eilidh Walker.Children : Abigail Burns, Ellie Cockburn, Grace Decoteau, Rhianna Devlin, Faith Heriot, Fraser Scott Hermiston, Chloe Noble, Ceijay Robinson, Rebecca Scott, Max Turnbull and Ellie Welsh.: Simona Andom, Sophia Blaen, Georgie Everett, Skye Machara Henderson, Sky Hume, Chloe Johnston, Emily Johnstone, Lucy Johnstone, Ellie mcLaren, Molly McLaren, Carrie Smith and Isla Train.PRODUCTIONStage Crew: Billy Easson, Steven Headspeath, Craig Monks, Adam Nichol and Malcolm Wilson.Prompter: Sheila WilsonMake Up  Hair: Team from Millars Hair SalonMake Up Co-ordinator: Yvonne KeddieProps: Gordon Keddie and Sarah PhilipsChildrens Co-ordinator: Amanda BlacklockChildrens Organizer: Michelle DevlinPhotographs: Jade PringleGroup Bookings: Morag KeddieRaffle: Susan FalconerScenery: Border StudiosFront of House: Lana ThomsonKeyboards: Chris AchenbachPercussion: Graham Borthwick"},{"url":null,"title":"new-housing-estate-for-lauder-given-go-ahead","story":"SCOTTISH Borders Council has given the go-ahead to a brand new housing estate in Lauder.Members of the councilrsquos planning and building standards body voted unanimously to approve an application from Persimmon Homes to build  new homes just north of Thirlestane Drive.Seven people have objected to the development, with a further four expressing concerns, including Kimberly Shaw-Walker, of Thirlestane Drive.She wrote: ldquoThe site is not suitable for the volume of houses proposed.

range of partners and potential funders are actively engaged in the effort to bring the project to fruition.#While our interest is focused on the sailing and powerboating aspects, we fully understand the benefits of working with other water based sports to create a community asset, within which we create synergies, economies and share skill sets.#It is a model that is worthy of replicating where and one which closely aligns with general development in community sport across Scotland.#We firmly believe the new Kintyre Seasports facility will create a hub within the community of Campbeltown where all members of the community can learn, practice, train and enjoy an active engagement in the sea.#Such opportunities are known to provide a tangible connection to improvements in health, social

roots opportunities within sailing and powerboating as well as other sports, provides young people with positive habits and skills that last a letime and iniably enhance employability.#We find the club environment is also an excellent place for the development of interpersonal skills, intergenerational relationships and to experience positive role models from many walks of le.#Families enjoy a place which is safe for children and supports the active participation of parents in sport, sustaining lelong participation and encouraging family cohesion through sharing of activity.#The uniqueness of sailing is that there are no barriers to participation.#Those aged from eight-years-old to , with disability or able bodied, LGBT or otherwise can share the same activity, learn and compete on an equal basis with minimal adjustments and are bonded by their love of boating.#There is every reason to expect that the Kintyre Seasports Project will be a shining example of inclusion.#The full potential of the project lies in the wider connections across the communities of interest the facility will serve.#Campbeltown sits on one of the most ied and interesting stretches of water in Scotland having benefits of both the shelter for Campbeltown Loch and immediate access to wider open sea in the Kilbrannan Sound and the Irish Sea.#In addition to becoming a hub of community activity,

However, when the fall of communism led to the break-up of Yugoslavia, war came to Bosnia in , driven in part by Serbiarsquos desire to create a lsquoGreater Serbiarsquo, including large parts of Bosnia, from which they planned to remove Croats and Muslims in what became known as lsquoethnic cleansingrsquo.Our delegation leader Resad Trbonja was , living in Sarajevo. On April , , he woke to find his city under siege, surrounded by Serbian artillery and snipers on the mountains overlooking the city. The siege would last four years, the longest in modern warfare, longer than Stalingrad. An average of  mortars landed in the city every day, , on the worst day.Resad, who lived through, and fought in, the siege, explained that Sarajevo regressed two centuries overnight ndash no water, no electricity, no phones. The Serbian army allowed minimal UN aid into the city sporadically but nothing .The survival of the siege is a story of human courage, spirit and defiance.Our first visit was to the remnants of a tunnel, dug under Sarajevo airport to reach Bosnian-held territory on the other side. This tiny tunnel was the only way in or out for four years.Through this tunnel extra aid came, for example from Edinburgh Direct Aid, who drove lorries of supplies from Edinburgh to help Sarajevans. My own predecessor, John Home Robertson, then MPfor East Lothian, spent several Parliamentary recesses as a volunteer lorry driver. It was dangerous work and one of his colleagues died on the notorious road known as lsquoSnipers Alleyrsquo.Perhaps the most affecting visit in Sarajevo was to the War Childhood Museum, where those who grew up in the siege display the things they kept to remind them of what it was like, and tell their story.A homemade cardboard knightrsquos breastplate made by a brother who later died a cuddly toy from a UN delivery, cuddled threadbare because it was the only toy a homemade lsquounormrsquo for a childrenrsquos choir which rehearsed and performed in defiance of bombs and bullets the remains of a playpark lsquojungle gymrsquo kept to remember the day a mortar tore it apart and killed your friend ndash no one who visits this museum will forget it.That is true too of Srebrenica. This was supposedly a lsquosafe havenrsquo protected by UN troops. Yet on July , Serbian paramilitary units overran it. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims sought refuge in the UN base at a disused factory.When we visited the museum now sited there, survivor Hasan Hasanovic explained to us how UN soldiers stood by as women and children were herded onto buses and deported, while their men were separated and removed in lorries. They were systematically murdered nearby. Thousands more who tried to escape through the forest were hunted down, shepherded into a meadow, and shot. In all, , Bosnian Muslim men and boys were slaughtered at Srebrenica.Finally, the international community acted. In a matter of days, air strikes lted the siege of Sarajevo, drove Serbian paramilitaries out of much of the territory they had occupied, and forced agreement to a peace deal signed in Dayton, Ohio.Srebrenica was not the only genocide in this war, but it is emblematic because it happened under the noses of the UN and because of the bravery of the Mothers of Srebrenica, who ed home to find out what happened to their husbands and sons, refused to be silenced, and demanded justice.This led to the International Commission on Missing Persons and the forensic anthropology unit in Tuzla, where we saw the incredible work done to identy remains using DNA. More than , victims of genocide have now been identied, allowing their families to grieve and to bury them at the final stop of our visit.We arrive at the cemetery at Potaceri, outside Srebrenica, as the sun sets.

In future, though, I will not be quite so hasty to pass judgement.My first ndash and hopefully last ndash experience of refereeing a match came when I went to watch my eldest son play for his school team. As the game was about to kick-off it emerged no whistler had turned up. So I got tapped on the shoulder by one of the coaches and asked to step in to the breach.Now, it was hardly the second leg of the Copa Liberatadores final between Boca Juniors and River Plate in the Bernabeu. It was a seven-a-side game between a bunch a  and -year-old boys on one third of an articial pitch in the suburbs of Glasgow. Nevertheless, it gave an eye-opening insight into the lot of the man-in-black.Who knew, for example, that determining which player touched the ball last in a   challenge and which team should subsequently be awarded a throw-in could be dficult  Having a linesman would have helped. But it was startling how something so seemingly straightforward could be so challenging.The reaction to many of my calls ndash indignation, outrage, tears, recrimination, disbelief ndash was also unexpected.Anyone who says that kids arenrsquot influenced by how high-profile professional players behave on television is, as Steve Clarke might well say, talking out of their backside.One particular objectionable urchin, who must have stood all of three feet tall in his studs, spent a couple of minutes after the game offering a less than complimentary appraisal of my performance. Apparently, for example, shouting isnrsquot allowed in boysrsquo football and is punishable by a free-kick. You learn something new every day.As for the spectators! Their conduct of the smattering of onlookers in what was effectively a kickabout left much to be desired. One especially joyless parent on the sidelines took time to inform me ldquothat was a blue ball after one of my dubious calls. Had he sensed my deep-rooted anti-blue agenda Then there was my positioning. I made Willie Young look like Kylian Mbappe as a I lumbered about the pitch trying to keep up with the action. But I lost count of the occasions I found myself either in the way of play or in a hopeless vantage point.How do referees possibly work out in the blink of an eyea player who was in an offside position had been interfering with play after a goal is scored by a team mate  How do they cope with making such a call in front of tens of thousands of people  The mind truly boggled.Several Stella after the ordeal, I concluded that referees are selfless not clueless iniduals, have a nigh on impossible task and deserve our sympathy and support not abuse and opprobrium.At the very least, they need VAR. The system, as we saw at Russia , isnrsquot perfect, but in an age when every passage of play is filmed from half a dozen dferent angles and incidents dissected the instant they happen, it would help quell a growing disaffection with match officials and make their lives easier."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-stock-exchange-could-be-up-and-running-within-months","story":"The company behind the plans, Bourse Scot Ltd, has agreed a partnership with established stock market operator Euronext, and claims the exchange could launch in the second quarter of .The initiative, known as Project Heather, will form the first Scottish stock exchange since the s, with a head office in Edinburgh and further offices planned for Glasgow and Aberdeen.Project leader Tomaacutes Carruthers, an experienced broker and entrepreneur, said: ldquoStock exchanges play a vital role in bringing together investors and businesses seeking investment.ldquoIn the s there were five such exchanges across Scotland, enabling Scottish investors to directly fund business opportunities which, in turn, supported economic growth.ldquoFty years on and the economic landscape in Scotland is very dferent.

Indeed, while accountancy giants EY and KPMG are the latest in a long line of experts to issue warnings about the potentially dire economic prospects facing both Scotland and the UKan orderly withdrawal cannot be agreed, the Federation of Small Businesses has found that ldquothe uncertainty and confusion associated with Brexit has brought Scottish business confidence to its lowest-ever ebb, with firms - for which read employers - north of the Border ldquoparticularly distressed about the current state of affairs.While that could have serious consequences for the jobs market, fears are growing about the impact Brexit could have on Scotlandrsquos cultural scene, which relies on international funding packages not to mention the free movement of people for its survival. Though Aberdeenshire-based arts director Claudia Zeiske has floated plans for a body that would help Scottish artists maintain ties with Europe following the UKrsquos departure, the organisation would rely on external funding to survive and we all know what happens to funding for the arts in times of economic stre.Asall that wasnrsquot bad enough the pound, which has never recovered from the battering it took in the wake of the Brexit referendum, fell so low after Theresa May yesterday decided to postpone parliamentrsquos vote on her withdrawal plan that it is now essentially on an equal footing to both the dollar and the euro. Not only does that have serious consequences for trade, it makes a mockery of all that Brexit was supposed to achieve and brings cold comfort to anyone hoping to escape the gloom by indulging in a bit of winter sun. Quite where the pound will be when summer comes around is anyonersquos guess.Of course, just because the European court has said we can cancel Brexit does not mean that we will, with the case still to go back to the Court of Session for a final ruling. As the Scottish judges had sought their European colleaguesrsquo opinion in order to help them make their decision that may well turn out to be a formality, but even then cancelling the deal will in no way be a done deal. While the ECJ ruling has made clear that parliament can instruct the Government to halt the Brexit process, arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg noted that the latter is unlikely to accept such instructions without a fight. ldquoThe only way to stay in the European Union is to legislate to do so, to reverse the Withdrawal Act, and that would require the Government to do a complete U-turn, he said soon after the judgment was handed down. And, though hersquoll have sent many hearts a-fluttering by adding that ldquothis government would find it very dficult to remain the governmentit went away from what it said in its manesto and the referendum result, the logical alternative - a change of regime - would not necessarily bring about a dferent result.Indeed, while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is apparently itching to form a minority government should MPs vote to reject Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement, his long-held opposition to the European project would suggest that far from seeking to give up on Brexit he would instead look to make his own mark on it. Given how shambolic his Labour leadership has been, it can hardly be imagined that he will be able to magically deliver something better than the Prime Ministerrsquos wholly unsatisfactory deal - or that Mrs May will be able to negotiate some kind of improvement simply by delaying parliamentrsquos vote.Yet as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pointed out on Twitter, what the ECJ judgment does pave the way for is ldquoan extension of Article  to allow time for another vote, followed by revocation of Article the outcome is Remain. As we now know so much more about the implications of Brexit than we did when the first referendum was held, surely this is not only the most preferable route to go down but the fairest too.Wersquove known for some time that the economic consequences of leaving the EU will be far from favourable and the news on that front only seems to be getting worse. With the popular support for Brexit now being led by none other than Tommy Robinson - a man so extreme in his views that even yesterdayrsquos xenophobe Nigel Farage has distanced himself from him - the whole project has descended into farce. Thanks to the ECJ ruling, at the very least MPs can vote down the withdrawal agreement - in whatever form it may eventually take - safe in the knowledge that no-deal chaos does not have to ensue.

The pattern is repeated in nearby North Ayrshire, where those renting homes spend pound a month compared to homeowners pound.The average Bill for people in rented accommodation in North Lanarkshire topped pound while mortgages were said to even out at around pound.In Falkirk renters can expect to pay pound compared to those owning property spending pound per month, in Clackmannanshire the dference is pound compared to pound, while in West Dunbartonshire a rented home costs pound while the average mortgage for a similar property is pound.Other areas where owning a home beat renting were South Lanarkshire, where monthly mortgage costs were pound compared to pound, Inverclyde, where the typical monthly payment was pound versus pound in rent, Dundee City, where mortgages were pound compared to pound, and Renfrewshire, where the cost of owning a home was pound while renting was pound. Zoopla identied Hartlepool in the north-east of England as the location where buying could be most cost-effective when compared with renting.The cost of monthly mortgage repayments in Hartlepool could typically be .% cheaper than renting, the research calculated.At the other end of the spectrum, outside London, St Albans was found to be the local authority area where renting was found to be most cost-effective compared with buying, followed by the district of South Buckinghamshire.: Gap closing betweenRural and urban property prices.Lawrence Hall, spokesperson for Zoopla, said: ldquoIn some areas renters are paying a premium when you compare their outgoings to that of homeowners servicing a mortgage.\"Of course, buying isnrsquot always a viable option for those who arenrsquot able to put down a deposit or want the flexibility renting can offer.\"Those looking for comparatively cost-effective places to rent should keep an eye on the countryrsquos top locations such as St. Albans, where renting is almost a quarter cheaper than servicing a mortgage.Figures from the Scottish Government show that from  to , all areas of Scotland - with the exception of Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire - saw increases in rent for two-bedroom properties.These ranged from . per cent in Ayrshire to almost  % in Lothian and Glasgow.During the past year the Scottish Government helped fund , social rented homes, an increase of  homes on the previous year.Graeme Brown, Director of Shelter Scotland, said that many people in rented accommodation struggle the high costs of monthly payments to landlords.He said: \"The single biggest reason people call us is because they are having dficulty affording a home, and private-renters are over-represented in those who contact us for help.ldquoHigh rents are a particular problem in places where demand simply outstrips supply and the cost of owning is so high that renting from private landlords is the only option for many.\": Housebuilder Bellway warns of Brexit risk to peak selling season#However, he said that comparisons between the cost of a mortgage and average rents could be misleading, as they did not take into account the other financial aspects of owning a home.Mr Brown said: \"To compare monthly rent with monthly mortgage payments is far too simplistic. It takes no account of mortgage interest, repairs, maintenance, buildings or le insurance or the cost of furnishing a home which is included in rent in many cases.\"He added: \"If all goes well mortgage-holders will one day have an asset but there are costs and risks which come with buying which mean it is not the best option for everyone.\"ldquoWhile private rents are too high for many people, the answer is to ensure we have a signicant increase in secure, affordable homes for social rent. We need to rebuild our social housing stock which has been depleted due to the now abolished right-to-buy legislation which saw homes sold-off and never replaced.\""},{"url":null,"title":"school-attainment-gap-between-rich-and-poor-could-take-decades-to-close","story":"Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made improving education one of the defining missions of her administration there has been precious little to cheer about.The latest set of official education figures from the Scottish Government will provide the SNP with belief the tide is finally turning.The statistics show overall standards in reading, writing and numeracy for pupils leaving primary school are all rising after a decline in recent years.There was also a slight closing of the yawning attainment gap between the richest and poorest pupils in reading and writing at P - although it will take decades for the gap to fully close at current rates of progress.John Swinney, the Education Secretary, suggested the findings showed the setting up of the pound million Pupil Equity Fund , which channels extra money to schools serving disadvantaged areas, was beginning to have an impact.He said: ldquoThere is an increased proportion of primary pupils assessed as achieving the expected levels of Curriculum for Excellence by up to four percentage points which coincides with the first year of the fund.ldquoWhile it is too early to draw direct conclusions from this data, I am encouraged to see the attainment gap has also narrowed slightly.However, the gap is still signicant and grows wider as pupils move up through primary and into secondary.Overall, fewer than three out of five of Scotlandrsquos most disadvantaged pupils achieve expected standards in literacy by P compared to  per cent of the richest pupilsOnly two-thirds of the same group are meeting expected levels of numeracy compared to  per cent of affluent pupils.And even though overall standards have increased there are still around a quarter of pupils who move to secondary without meeting expected standards in literacy and numeracy.Liz Smith, the Scottish Conservative Partyrsquos education spokeswoman, described the figures as ldquogrim.ldquoThe fact one in three pupils is leaving primary school without reaching basic standards in literacy is the main worry, she said.ldquoThese figures arenrsquot just bad news for the prospects of youngsters, but bad for the future economy.Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, criticised the ldquoutter failure of the Scottish Government to tackle attainment.He added: ldquoSNP ministers claim education is the top priority, but these figures show that the poorest young people are being failed badly.The figures also showed some welcome relief for the Scottish Government in the ongoing teacher recruitment crisis.In   the number of teachers rose to its highest level since  with schools now employing , full time equivalent teachers after an increase of  from the previous year.However, once again there are signicant caveats. Although the number of teachers increased overall, in almost a third of councils totals fell.And the figures showed nearly , teachers are being paid for through PEF funding rather than core grants, which provides less long-term security.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union, said PEF funding was ldquoinflating the figures.ldquoThese posts, valuable though they are, are short-term only and not guaranteed to be retained in future years, he said.ldquoThese posts were always intended to be on top of the existing workforce and,you strip them out, there are just over , teachers in Scotland compared to more than , in . The EIS also attacked a continuing decline in the number of qualied teachers working in nurseries.However, Mr Swinney said teacher levels were the highest this decade, adding: ldquoThe average size of primary one classes has been dropping consistently in recent years, which is particularly important as helping children in the early years is crucialwe are to close the attainment gap between the most and least deprived.There is another concern about the statistical publication from the Scottish Government on achievements in literacy and numeracy.The background notes describe the statistics as ldquoexperimental because they are based on the professional judgements of teachers after the Scottish Government scrapped the previous system of pupil surveys.Of the  local authorities that submitted information to the current publication only one third said they were ldquogenerally confident in the robustness of the data.That means Scotland does not have a reliable system of evaluation of basic standards allowing for detailed comparisons of councils or schools, despite the introduction of standardised assessments.Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said the situation was unacceptable.He said: ldquoExperts have warned it will now take years to build up the evidence of how our pupils are really getting on."},{"url":null,"title":"derek-mackay-could-bypass-greens-to-secure-scottish-budget","story":"One option would be to rely on the two LibDem MSPs for Orkney and Shetland, who voted for the last budget because of a pound.m investment in local ferry services.The support of Liam McArthur and Tavish Scott would have enabled the SNP minority government to secure its budget by  votes to , eventhe Greens had opposed it.A Scottish Government source said the experience had demonstrated there were ldquointeresting options available, adding: ldquoTherersquos more than one way to skin this cat.Green MSP Andy Wightman also admitted the budget could pass without his partythe finance secretary won over MSPs with ldquopork barrel spending in their constituencies.He told The Herald: ldquoLast year did demonstrate the government can rely on the support of constituency members on matters of importance to their constituents.ldquoThey got those two votes from the Liberals.

Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own Parliaments or Assemblies with substantial control over domestic matters, both legislative and administrative.But, as the Lords Constitution Committee reported in  ldquothe largest and most powerful nation in the UK is without separate recognition and representation.There have been ious attempts to deal with this, but all have been unsatisfactory. The Tory Government tried a isive plan based on ldquoEnglish Votes for English Lawswith only English MPs able voting on purely English legislation at Westminster. That has been a spectacular failure.On administrative devolution, there has been an a la carte menu of dferent schemes with catchy titles like Northern Powerhouse,Mayors, City Deals and Midlands Engine which has produced a piecemeal pattern with most of the power still remaining in Whitehall.Arguably the most successful have been the eightMayors, but they have dfering degrees of power which leaves them, as the Commons Constitution Committee observed, ldquostruggling with the piecemeal delegation of powers and s. Meanwhile, country areas are untouched.The disparity in fiscal devolution is reflected in the Scottish Parliament controlling  per cent of tax revenues, Wales  per cent and Northern Ireland  per cent while English local authorities collect only nine per cent of their revenue.So the challenge is how to produce a more coherent and comprehensive system of devolution for the whole UK which also addresses the English democratic deficit.Some favour an English Parliament which is attractive for legislation but does not deal with the demand for administrative decentralisation within England, where dissatisfaction with Whitehall is just as strong as it was in Scotland.Various attempts to start regional devolution within England, including John Prescottrsquos plan which died with a failed referendum in the north-east, have perished because Whitehall departments clung to all the real powers.The clue to solving the conundrum lies in Scotland where our Constitutional Convention in thes produced the blueprint for the Scottish Parliament when Labour came to power in . It involved MPs, peers, political parties, churches, unions and civic society with a high level of public engagement.Robert Hazell of The Constitution Unit supports a similar UK Constitutional Convention to build cross-party consensus, to develop a more coherent package of reform and generate wide public engagement. The aim would be to produce a coherent and comprehensive structure of devolution for the whole UK.Such a structure could also enable the House of Lords to be replaced by a Senate of the Nations and Regions indirectly elected by the devolved authorities. Such a chamber would then have some democratic legitimacy without challenging the primacy of the House of Commons.The Liberal Democrats, as federalists, support a Convention and Labour is committed to setting up one when in power.I donrsquot see why,the present Government refuses to set one up, it cannot be done now by Labour, other parties and bodies, as we did in Scotland, so we again have a blueprint ready to implement. Where Scotland led, the UK can surely follow."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-mackay-should-be-bold-and-take-the-chance-to-reshape-our-fiscal-landscape","story":"The big issue, had it not been for the Brexit shambles, would be the Scottish Governmentrsquos expected decision not to raise the threshold for higher rate tax payers to pound,, as announced in the UK Budget. This would normally be portrayed by the Conservatives and much of the press as an irresponsible Nat Tax increase that would ldquohammer middle income earners, even though it does nothing of the kind. Embarrassingly for Labour, the Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, controversially supported the Tory threshold rise, which of course is an effective tax cut for higher earners.Scots earning around pound, are a vocerous group and they could find themselves paying pound, more in income tax than they would had they been living in England. Thatrsquos serious money. However, few of the , or so higher rate payers are in a position to pay the relocation costs of fleeing to the border, eventhey wanted to. And of course many wonrsquot actually notice, since they will see no increase in their tax bills.So, with political attention where, Mr Mackay has a unique opportunity to raise tax without actually raising taxes ndash the ultimate stealth tax. Just doing nothing brings a conditional windfall of more than pound million, according to the Fraser of Allander Institute The vast majority of Scots, anyway, make a lot less than pound,. Median gross earnings are less than half that figure. Mr Mackay could fiddle around with the new rates and bands, and deliver a headline tax cut to half of Scottish workers and still be quids in. A useful little tax giveaway in what could be an election year. ndash though hersquod be wise to avoid pulling out too many budgetary rabbits since, with the Scottish economy expected to slow down after Brexit, overall tax revenues are likely to be depressed in future.Indeed, Mr Mackay has more than usual reason this year to be grateful for the much-maligned Barnett Formula. Thanks to Chancellor Philip Hammondrsquos increase in NHS spending, the Scottish Government will receive poundm for health alone next year through Barnet ldquoconsequentials. With NHS boards like Lothian plunging into the red, this has come not a moment too soon.As is well known, the SNP Government failed in past years to devote all the health revenue increases to the Scottish NHS. This time Mr Mackay has made clear every penny will go to health. Half a billion should at least paper over the cracks in a service which still has widespread public support, but has serious problems. Though no one should underestimate the capacity of the NHS to swallow vast amounts of public money.With new medicines and procedures, health spending needs to rise by around two per cent just to stand still. Scotlandrsquos population is ageing rapidly and older people need expensive care. Waiting targets in A E are being missed. There is a recruitment crisis that is only going to get worse as doctors and nurses stop coming from Europe after Brexit. The spending watchdog, Audit Scotland, reported recently that the NHS in Scotland is ldquofinancially unsustainable.The injection of cash from Westminster will put this crisis off for some years. However, the sheer volume of resources devoted to the NHS is creating problems where. Nearly half of the entire Scottish budget now goes on health, and this has squeezed local government. Thanks to austerity, council spending has been cut to the bone over the last decade, and there is little prospect of them being able to catch up. Crucial services like education, social care and waste recycling are disintegrating. Teachers are threatening to go on strikethey donrsquot get a  per cent pay increase.Council cuts canrsquot go on much longer without causing irreparable damage to communities. The obvious answer is to allow councils to raise more money themselves. But the Scottish Government allowed them to raise the council tax cap last year by three per cent, and it didnrsquot make much of a dent in the problem. Councils are also raising cash from things like parking charges and the ending of second home discounts, but more needs to be done. Many believe that only a replacement of the council tax itself, by a local income tax or land and property wealth tax, could close the gap.The Scottish Green Party, whose six pack of MSPs are threatening to vote against todayrsquos budget, could potentially bring down the Scottish Government over council tax reform. A firm timetable for its abolition is their green red line. But I doubt Scottish voters could cope with another parliament in crisis right now, so their co-leader Patrick Harvie will probably settle for rather less. Possibly movement towards the ldquotransitory visitor levy, otherwise known as the tourist tax.Itrsquos not entirely clear why Nicola Sturgeon is so leery of a tax that is applied in most European cities. Edinburgh hotel rates are now so high ndash more than pound a night on average ndash that a two per cent tax would hardly be noticed, especially since foreign visitors are paying  per cent less thanks to the collapse in the value of the pound. Never has low-hanging fruit dangled so tantalisingly close to a finance ministerrsquos grasp.Some talk of the agreeable and intelligent Derek Mackay as a future leader of the SNP, and he certainly has the chance to shine today. The Finance Secretary is reshaping the entire fiscal landscape of Scotland, and thanks to Brexit, getting the political space to do it."},{"url":null,"title":"castles-are-culture-too-national-trust-tells-scottish-government","story":"The Trustbelieves that the governments forthcoming Culture Strategy, due in , should include

We went to Radio Shropshire.“One of Victoria’s colleagues told me Victoria had left work at pm and said she was feeling upset and would be in work tomorrow.“Alarm bells started to ring.“Victoria has made two previous attempts to take her own le and suffers from depression.“We went to her house and continued to try and raise her by banging the doors and windows but there was still no reply.“We had tohome and I went alone back to her house with a key for her door.“I saw Victoria’s car parked on Buttington Road.

He will also lead the implementation of improvements as outlined in a recent internal report by the council on Tiree School where there are  high school pupils, plus  in the primary classes.A parent, who did not want to be named, said: “We received a copy of the internal report which was carried out by Argyll and Bute Council which highlights issues with leadership and teaching and it seems that Peter Bain is coming in here to provide strong leadership and expertise.“We understand this is an interim arrangement, but we haven’t been told all the details. They have said that he will be going in one day a week in the beginning and there might be two days a week at some point and early next year there are plans for him to come here for a week.”The source said they knew some parents had moved their children to mainland schools as they were unhappy with the educational provision at Tiree and added: “A lot of people have thought for a long time that Tiree High School has needed a change of model on how it is run. Maybe this is what we need.” The council report summary said: “There are a range of identied weaknesses in the strategic leadership of the school, which require to be immediately addressed. The leadership remits and responsibilities in the school need to be claried, including principal teachers.”It also stressed the need for policies to be put in place around key areas such as ­literacy, numeracy learning and teaching.Will Wright, vice-­chairman of Tiree Parent Council, said: “Parents are looking forward to hearing from the local authority and the new head teacher what their plans and their commitment are to the long-term future of the school.”Argyll and Bute Conservative Councillor Alastair Redman, from Islay, said: “I have no doubt that the headmaster of Oban will do a wonderful job being headmaster of Tiree as well. “That said, we also have to consider the cost to the taxpayer. It’s a balance between service and cost and I think better contingency plans should have been in place so that there didn’t have to be a stop-gap solution.”A spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council said: “We would like to thank Mr Wilks for his time at Tiree High School and wish him the very best in his new job.

He has become a thug.”The SNP MP escalated the matter further by raising a point of order with Speaker John Bercow in the Commons.Referencing the Press Association story, he said: “During proceedings earlier the Leader of the Opposition was opening his emergency debate when he had taken an intervention from a member of the Democratic Unionist Party, during the response from the Leader of the Opposition I said to my colleaguethat I wished the Leader of the Opposition would answer a question.“It then promotedto turn around to me and call me a piece of shit, Mr Speaker he then went on to defend that, telling a journalist that he was ‘just putting me in my place’.“As you know Mr Speaker I’ve no desire to raise this formally with you, I had hoped to deal with it informally as you suggested Mr Speaker, but given he shows no sign of having any regret about it can you just reaffirm that it’s wrong and can you reaffirm that members on all sides should be able to go about this place without being on the tail end of that kind of abuse.”Mr Bercow responded saying he “wasn’t there” and “wouldn’t presume to comment on a conversation I did not hear”.©JPIMedia Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4841317.1544289906!/image/image.jpg","title":"dan from edinburgh stuns bbc saturday kitchen phone in with c word","story":"A caller from Edinburgh has gone viral after viewers noticed that he had used the #c word# in a phone call placed to mid-morning cookery show Saturday Kitchen on the BBC. ‘Dan from Edinburgh’ was introduced as one of the viewers of the weekly show who wanted advice from a  of chefs on how best to cook Christmas Dinner. window.twttr With an unmistakable Edinburgh accent, Dan told the hosts: “You ken what it’s like this time of year, every c***s on about parsnips n aw that, so wits a barry side for Christmas ”Host Matt Tebbutt seemed to pick up on the profanity despite the thick accent as he looked ashe was struggling to hold back laughter as Dan posed his question.

This wee semi-detached cottage had no bathroom, no running hot water and no inside toilet so inevitably we loved it. Jeannie, our rotund grandmother, really was the stereotypical granny living in a house at the bottom of the woods and spoiled us within her limited means . My grandfather, also Jimmy, was an astonishingly good-looking man with crystal blue eyes he was a Stalinist for rather longer than was fashionable, and worked at Glenochil, the huge whisky bond, as a foreman, which to my unpractised eye meant he sat and read for a living: he was the only man I’ve ever known who took three novels to work. But he saved a man’s le in a terrible accident, being injured himself into a premature death – another, sadder, story as well.Anyway, Papa Jimmy used to take us for a walk in the woods on a fine day, thenus to the house for our lunch, which always included masses of butter, a substance somewhat rationed in our own home. Jimmy would retire to his chair and read the paper and chain smoke, ashing his fags into an ornate standing ashtray which was an object of great fascination to me and which I eventually inherited. On these walks, a bit like Uncle Pumblechook in ‘Great Expectations’, Papa Jimmy would ask us questions relating to our general knowledge – the times tables, dates in Scottish history, capital cities of the world. This once led to an argument – of quite heated proportions, because both these Jimmys were obstinate fellows – about the capital of Ceylon. Young Jimmy, probably about , knew it was Colombo old Jimmy, about , insisted it was Kandy. At eight, I did not feel well placed to intervene and contented myself with playing with bugs.: Cameron Wyllie: Face facts, some kids are smarter than othersGeneral knowledge was part of our lives then it was part of everyone’s. Twenty years later, in the s, as a young schoolteacher, I would always have a quiz book ready in my desk as an end-of-term treat: classes in teams, rounds of questions, sweeties as prizes. Even ‘less academically able’ boys – for this was a boys’ school – knew stuff, random facts about Russia or prime numbers or current affairs. Thirty years on, at the end of my career, I used to take great pleasure in the success of the school quiz teams indeed, we even granted our ‘quizzers’ the sacred right of ‘colours’ eventually, so the really successful ones went round the school with blazer badges saying ‘quiz’. No-one but me and other gnarled ancients thought this was remotely strange – that something as ordinary as general knowledge was in our youth had become a specialised extra-curricular activity – you did ‘quiz’ while others played the oboe or threw the discus.Does this matter  Clearly, the school curriculum has to move with the times and technology means that all of us can get away with knowing less stuff than we used to – when you don’t know somethingyou just Google it. Who is that actress  Who was that king  What, for God’s sake, is the capital of Ceylon, and why is it not called Ceylon anymore, and what can be done to stop brain cells oozing out my ears ...  I can’t be alone in suppressing a deeply rooted grumble when the nice girl in the shop reaches for a calculator to work out what  per cent of £ is, and then laboriously subtracts £. from £ etc etc. But, does it matter : Cameron Wyllie: Here’s how the snowflake generation can toughen upWell, it must a bit. If you don’t know that you need to know something, then you can’t Google it. Lots of information that was reasonably common currency simply isn’t there in the minds of young people and has been replaced by dferent skills, of which they have many. However,you are, for example, teaching a text that refers directly or indirectly to something  – the mention of Icarus in a poem by W H Auden, say, and the clever children in your Higher English class don’t have a scoobie who Icarus was, then they are, quite clearly, not able to understand the poem. Again, in the great scheme of things, this may not matter very much, but,we do not have things to connect, then E M Forster’s much-quoted dictum “only connect” cannot happen some intellectual breakthroughs just require two bits of factual knowledge to be laid side by side. All of this may just be a reaction to skills-based learning. Someone who did O-grade history in the s or s just would not recognise a National  paper today and I suspect that most history teachers would say that these changes are entirely right. I honestly think there is validity in both approaches, but I’m afraid I also have a little feeling in my tummy that says that knowing more things is one of the proofs that you are grown up.

Our spending plans for the year ahead will include long-term strategic investments that allow us to protect our essential public services, boost our economy and deliver on our commitments to the people of Scotland.”Mr Mackay said his budget was set against a backdrop of UK austerity, which was having “devastating impacts” on the most vulnerable.He added: “This is also a budget presented under the shadow of the UK government’s chaotic approach to Brexit, which hangs over our economy, our public services and risks making us all poorer in the future.”But Murdo Fraser, Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary, said the SNP’s ­reliance on support from the Scottish Greens would mean higher taxes.He said: “My message today to Derek Mackay is to back blue, not Green.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick harbour traffic continues to rise ","story":"The downturn in offshore operations had an ongoing impact on overall freight handled in the first nine months, compared with the same period in .Statistics for January to September, released by Lerwick Port Authority, show that vessel arrivals jumped by . per cent to ,, with tonnage up . per cent at . million gross tonnes.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

What we haven’t heard is what exactly it will mean for Shetland.”But clarity remained out of reach over the next two and a half hours with a pivotal vote in the House of Commons scheduled for Tuesday.Presenting a view from Westminster Mr Carmichael said: “Every time you think we’ve got to peak madness in the House of Commons something  happens.”He added that Tuesday will likely to be on “another level” and said that he hesitates to “predict anything beyond the next hour at the moment”.Miss Budge said that farmers were particularly worried about the future of subsidy payments in the aftermath of leaving the EU.“The big concern is where the Scottish government or UK government will find that kind of money to put into farming.”The tourism industry was most concerned about maintaining visa free travel for citizens of the EU, said Mr Mathieson, while Mrs Hambleton said that businesses had to scenario plan in order to offset any potential negative side effects from Britain’s departure. which had highlighted government analysis which warned of potential delays of up to six months for pharmaceuticals.“Project fear is now project reality”, he said.Unsurprisingly, the biggest optimism came from Mr Collins, who viewed Brexit as an opportunity for fishermen. He noted that British fishermen caught less than half of fish in UK waters, compared with Norway catching around  per cent in theirs.He later criticised the EU as undemocratic but said he was a committed European and that he and his partner had four EU passports between them. His ideal scenario would involve dismantling the EU and for the project to be rebuilt with more accountability and less bureaucracy.Indeed the EU came in for criticism throughout the night. Mr Carmichael said that his view was not “massively dferent” from that of Mr Collins. But where the fishermen’s chief was keen to depart Mr Carmichael favoured remaining and reforming.A straw poll at the close of proceedings found an overwhelming support for this view.

However, on turning , she was required to move home and the family worked with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar#s social work department to put in place suitable arrangements.It took two years to find a solution and in May this year, Eilidh moved back to Stornoway, where she was housed in supervised accommodation with a young male who also suffers from autism.Four complaints by the family over that accommodation provision were upheld by the Care Commission and, following an incident, the male was removed from the house to another unit. However, that sudden change in circumstance sparked an escalation in Eilidh#s behaviour and the family were informed by social work management that they were seeking an order under mental health legislation.Eilidh had been housed on her own in the psychiatric ward in the Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway but was flown to the mainland on Tuesday of this week as that ward faces closure. She is also on a daily course of benzodiazepine # despite never previously requiring any medication. Catherine Ann MacLeod, Eilidh#s aunt, said there had been a #mishandling# of her situation from the moment she was required to come back to the island.#Eilidh is not psychotic,# said Ms MacLeod. #What she was displaying was traits of autism. The male was removed from the house all of a sudden and Eilidh is not able to process sudden changes without careful handling. That#s why she became more aggressive she#s not able to express herself properly. It would never have happened had a proper care plan been in place.#Whatever happens now, they#ve broken Eilidh # she#ll not be the same now. It#s broken my sister, too.

I am very concerned that they need to be reassured that there is accommodation for Eilidh long-term on the island, where she can be near her family.#There is no doubt that the family have had reason to be anxious about this question and I hope that we will now see dferent agencies working together in the islands to find a solution. I continue to work with the family to raise a number of complaints which they have about the way they feel they have been treated this far.#The islands currently face a major shortage of staff in the care sector, partly as a result of depopulation.The comhairle denied that decisions over Eilidh#s care were in any way motivated by budgetary constraints. A spokesman said they were #unable to comment on inidual cases#.#As a general principle,# the spokesman added, #we are committed to supporting people with complex needs in their own communities but for a small number of people there are circumstances in which outcomes will improvethey are supported in specialist centres of excellence on the mainland. This is not a matter of a lack of financial resources but rather not having the required levels of specialist care and expertise.#Whilst this is the case for many areas across Scotland it is clearly more acute in an island setting because it involves those requiring such care to live away from home for perhaps extended periods of time. It is also the case that implementing such measures and deciding when it is appropriate to repatriate service users is a matter of assessment and judgement.#The spokesman added that they were currently #in the process of developing a new strategy on learning disabilities and autism and this will consider whether we have the right balance between local support and specialist mainland provision#.By Murray MacLeod"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27497  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinSinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit. - Mary Lou McDonald TDAmid all the chaos in Westminster, there are few certainties as to where the Brexit circus will stumble to next.Brexit began as a squabble between the rich and right wing boys of the Tory party. Ireland north or south was never a concern yet we will all pay the cost for generations to come.Brexit represents a huge threat to the social, economic and political le of this island. The outworking of Brexit could be the imposition of hard border.That is why the people of the north - from all communities and backgrounds - voted to reject it.They knew it would devastate the economy, strip away rights and undermine our political agreements.And that is why, in the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Sinn Féin embarked on a diplomatic offensive across Europe warning of the dangers of Brexit and putting forward our demand for a unique solution for the north which would respect the majority remain vote.Through intense lobbying in Brussels, Strasbourg, Dublin and London, Sinn Féin led and built support for the idea that our unique position and peace agreements required a unique Brexit solution.Our case for special status for the north within the EU sought to ensure there would be no hard border, that citizens rights would be upheld and the Good Friday Agreement protected in all its parts.As the prospect of a no deal Brexit became more likely, we made it clear the north needed to remain in the customs union and single market in order to prevent our economy being driven off a clf by the Tories and their DUP allies.That was reflected in the backstop which was agreed by the EU and the British government. But as soon as it was agreed the British government, as they always do, began trying to renege on its commitments.Our position remains now as it was then. That backstop must be maintained and protected. It provides the bottom line and is our insurance policy against the worst excesses of Brexit, which we know will be a disaster for this country.The backstop is not perfect and neither is the withdrawal agreement. There is no such thing as a good Brexit after all.There are still issues of concern and clarication required, particularly relating to the issues of rights and representation.Over the course of the last number of days Sinn Féin has met with An Taoiseach and An Tanáiste and have been in contact with Theresa May about all of these concerns.The pro-remain parties represent the majority of people in the north and are fighting on their behalf.By contrast, the DUP are actively trampling the best interests of people and business in the north in their reckless cheerleading for an as yet  Tory Brexit.Sinn Féin will continue to stand with all other parties who advocate for citizens’ rights, our economic interests and our agreements in the face of Brexit.  We will continue to put pressure on the Irish government to act in the interests of citizens, north and south and hold the Taoiseach to his pledge that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish Government.Whatever twists and turns the Brexit debacle takes next, the backstop as agreed must be maintained. It cannot be sacriced in an attempt to save the ailing career of Theresa May or to serve the hard-line agendas of the Brexiteers in the Tory party or the DUP. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27499  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonGUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers# rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.- Declan Kearney MLADimitrios Papadimoulis is a Greek MEP who represents the Syriza party in the European Parliament.He has spent a le time involved in left wing political activism in his native Greece and has been a member of the Syriza central leadership which brought the party from opposition into government in , while the country was still in the midst of its financial and economic crisis and subjected to extreme political and economic pressure by the European Unionestablishment.Dimitrios is ‘laconic and philosophical in the way of Sparta’ – to borrow a phrase he used during a contribution at a recent conference which we attended together in Brussels, organised by GUE-NGL the European Parliamentary group to which both Sinn Féin and Syriza are affiliated.This meeting brought together leadership representatives and MEPs from twenty of the most signicant political parties on the progressive Left in the EU to discuss the future direction of GUE-NGL and future political strategy and co-operation among left wing and progressive parties including the  European elections, and the next term of the EU parliament.During one of our conversations at the conference Dimitrios recalled a story from -

They need to become realities.So political activists who are committed to transformational change need to be grounded in the real world.They have to understand what they can deliver in the here and now, and then to have a plan to achieve even more.But the progressive Left can only make change when it has the strength to do so.That means setting realistic objectives and priorities, and then devising strategies which work.I said in my opening comments to the conference that Europe is at a crossroads.The political direction, policy orientation, and increasing need for reform of the EU coupled with, and often fuelling the rise of the extreme right wing, now presents an existential threat to the principles of the progressive Left.Social democracy has effectively collapsed both politically and electorally across Europe.There is a need to build a progressive Left alternative, and to popularise a new political narrative or common sense based upon core ideas: To include:·         That economies serve the many and not the few:·         That human and democratic rights are inalienable:·         That the global environment is protected:·         That Europe should act as a force for international peace and solidarity: and·         That racism, sectarianism, misogyny, homophobia and xenophobia are opposed.These ideas should be a common  for expanding the political strength of the progressive Left.However, that potential faces many challenges.Some of these are beyond the control of the progressive Left, but others are not.All of this was under discussion at the GUE-NGL conference.There were many notable contributions.Arnaldo Otegi, the General Secretary of the EH Bildu was in attendance.He had just received the ground breaking judgement from the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled his prosecution was wrong.During Arnaldos presentation he provided a powerful critique of global capitalism and the importance of defending community and social values.Panos Skourletis has been a senior minister of the Syriza government.In a highly signicant move several months ago, he moved from that role to take up the position of Secretary of Syrizas Central Committee.Panos set out an analysis of the situation in Greece and wider Europe and argued that it is time for a common front of left parties and other progressives and democratic forces in Europe.Earlier I argued that unity and cohesion are essential between parties and democratic forces on the left in Europe: and that we must focus on what expands unity, whilst respecting our dferences and uniqueness as parties and national movements.Sinn Féin believes that GUE-NGL has successfully enabled progressive parties from the left to co-operate within the European Parliament, whilst recognising the autonomy of political delegations.This is one of GUE-NGL’s strengths as a parliamentary group and deserves to be consolidated.Unanimity is not required on all issues, all of the time but progressives cannot afford to be disunited.Political sectarianism undermines political strength, solidarity and fraternity on the progressive Left.The collective strength of the progressive Left in Europe stems from the domestic relevance and political strength of its constituent parts.The left will only be as strong in the European Parliament as progressive Left and republican parties are relevant and strong in their national contexts.The success of a real progressive Left alternative,  depends upon securing strategic beach heads of political strength and influence.This is why support for Europes only left wing government in Greece is so politically important.Whilst progressives need to be in a hurry to make change and in pursuit of a social and more democratic Europe, we also need to be realistic and pragmatic.The distinction between strategy and tactical positions need to be understood.Alliances with others are indispensable to the process of changing the overall balance of forces.Rigid or dogmatic ideological positions can prevent agreement upon shared objectives and securing unity among the widest cross section of progressive and democratic opinion.The political discussion and focus upon an emergent European Progressive Caucus embracing the Left, social democrats, and environmentalists is such an innovative and welcome initiative.I proposed to the Brussels conference that a strategic consensus among the progressive Left and others should be based upon support for national independence, social emancipation, citizens rights, and democratic control over the economy.For our part Sinn Féin will contest the European election in  on an agenda which advocates for the creation of a Social Europe.We will be emphasising the need to protect rural and fishing communities the promotion of economic democracy enhanced environmental policy, human rights and social justice as well as defence of the Irish peace process and support for a united Ireland.The onset of Brexit has changed the political and social landscape in Ireland, and also signicantly influenced political discourse within the EU itself.It has swept away all of the established constitutional, political and economic assumptions about the status quo in Ireland and refocused international attention upon the democratic case for Irish unity.During the conference I highlighted the denial of citizens rights and blocking of political democracy in the north of Ireland by the DUP and British Tory government. The point was made that this existential rights crisis, combined with the imposition of Brexit represented the most serious threat to the Good Friday Agreement, and the democratic option for managing change in the north of Ireland.The European Parliament  EU institutions have become strategically important forums within which to promote the democratic aim of a united Ireland and to encourage support for an Irish unity referendum. The level of interest in, and support for constitutional change in Ireland is now at an unprecedented high level across the EU.Sinn Féin will continue lobbying to make the case for a united Ireland a priority for the progressive Left and within other sections of democratic opinion represented in the European Parliament. Irish unity is integral to the vision of a new Europe.Going forward, the progressive Left in Europe needs to focus its collective efforts upon maximising representation and influence in the next parliament.GUE-NGL has to expand as an inclusive, welcoming group, providing a voice for progressive change.It should act as a catalyst for new alliances with other democratic and progressive groups in the next parliament term which support the need to democratise and reform the EU support workers rights defend the environment oppose bigotry and discrimination and champion international solidarity and peace.That is what the shared ambition of a New Europe should mean. Sinn Féin has a central role in promoting that vision.The progressive Left across Europe has much to do.We need to be people in a hurry.The future cannot wait.We need to plan, organise and attract the popular support to make change for all tomorrow: To build a New Europe - a Europe of Equals. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27500  ","story":"• John James Kelly, Jimmy Joe Reynolds and Charlie #Cathal# McCafferty Staff ReporterThe three men were in a back room in the house of Patrick Kelly, brother of John James, when the explosion blew away part of the walls and roof.On  November , IRA Volunteers blew up six customs posts along the border in Counties Armagh and Fermanagh.

The exact cause of the premature explosion has never been discovered, though Patrick Kelly said later that the men realised that the proposed time of the Strabane explosion coincided with the coming home of Strabane people from the cinema in Lford. The Volunteers decided to change the time on the timing device and in doing so they caused the explosion.The three men who died were experienced Volunteers. John James Kellys father had been a Fenian and he himself was raised in the Fenian tradition. He was recruited into the IRB at an early age and formed a group of Irish Volunteers in Clady. He took part in many operations during the Tan War and was arrested and imprisoned in England.

He was the OC in that county and had been for a time OC of Britain. He had been sent to Donegal as the representative of the IRAs General Headquarters Staff and it was he who transported the bombs - three in all - to Stranamuck.Jimmy Joe had been active in the IRA for many years. In  he was charged along with six other men, including his twin brother, John Joseph, with the assassination of a rack-renting landlord, More OFarrell, at Edgeworthstown, Co Longford.

Seismic political events, including the Home Rule crisis, the World War, the  Rising and the Conscription threat had shaken the country since the last General Election in . Women had the vote for the first time, other restrictions on the universal right to vote had been removed and the widening of democracy helped to ensure a stunning victory for Sinn Féin on a Republican . Ireland elected  members to the House of Commons in the Westminster Parliament. They were elected in single-seat constituencies on the first-past-the-post voting system, as Westminster MPs are elected to this day. Since its foundation in  Sinn Féin had advocated the withdrawal of Irish MPs from Westminster and the establishment of an Irish constituent assembly. It was only in , in successive by-election victories, that Sinn Fein won Westminster seats and put its abstentionist policy into operation. The swing to Sinn Féin was not only because of the executions and mass imprisonments after the  Rising there was also growing opposition to Irelands involvement in the war and its cost in lives, the inclusion in the British Cabinet of Tory Unionists who vehemently opposed any form of Home Rule, the threat of Partition and the ineffectiveness of the Irish Party at Westminster, led by John Redmond, increasingly seen as collaborators with British imperialism, as well as ongoing repression and press censorship. Redmond died in March  and in April the British government introduced legislation to impose Conscription in Ireland. The Irish Party MPs withdrew from Westminster in protest, thus ending forever any signicant Irish nationalist presence in that Parliament. Sinn Féin, the Irish Volunteers and the trade union movement took the lead in the anti-Conscription campaign. The Irish Party was also involved and it had three by-election successes in  but the writing was on the wall. In East Cavan in June Sinn Féins Arthur Grfith won a decisive victory on the abstentionist  which Irish Party leader John Dillon had called a policy of lunatics. It was widely predicted that Dillons party faced heavy defeat whenever the General Election came. Well before the war ended, Sinn Féins election preparations were under way. The jailing of many of its leaders in the British governments concocted German Plot did not deter the movement. In August  General Secretaries Harry Boland and Tom Kelly reported to the Ard Chomhairle that there were over , cumainn throughout the country. The same meeting endorsed a motion to contest every seat in the General Election “in order to give every Irish voter the opportunity of voting for or against the establishment of an independent Irish Republic”. By the time of the Sinn Féin Ard Fheis in October , many candidates had already been selected, a process overseen by Harry Boland, based at the movement’s Head Office in  Harcourt Street, Dublin. That same month the electoral register was revised to take account of the widened franchise. Women over  could vote for the first time and remaining property qualications for men over  were removed. This meant that the number of people in Ireland entitled to vote in the General Election grew enormously from , in  to ,, in . On  October the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress announced its intention to stand in a number of constituencies. But there was opposition both internally and externally. Sinn Féin requested that Labour candidates take a pledge to abstain totally from Westminster, in which case Sinn Féin would stand aside in selected seats. But the Labour position was to abstain conditionally, retaining the option to attend in certain circumstances. A great many trade unionists were members or supporters of Sinn Féin and opposed Labour standing unless the full pledge was taken. A special conference of the Irish Labour Party and Trade Union Congress was held in the Mansion House on  and  November, at which the decision was taken not to stand in the General Election. Debate has continued ever since about the reasons for this decision and its consequences. There was a wide iety of views within the Irish trade union movement ranging from socialist republicans to Home Rulers to Unionists, so the reasons for non-participation were ied. Historian Dorothy Macardle put it this way: \"The majority of the working men and women of Ireland were members of Sinn Féin or the Volunteers or Cumann na mBan, and, as the disciples of James Connolly, held that the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the working classes must be pursued as one unided aim.\" . The war ended on  November and the British Parliament was dissolved on  November. Polling days was set for  December. The Sinn Féin manesto reflected the republican position adopted by the Ard Fheis a year previously and stated that the party \"gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic\". It was committed to establishing the Irish Republic by withdrawing Irish representation from Westminster, using “any and every means available” to make British rule impossible, establishing a constituent assembly and appealing to the post-war Peace Conference to recognise Ireland as an independent nation. It roundly condemned the role of the Irish Party in collaborating with the British government and attempting to “harness the Irish people to England’s war chariot”. The Manesto endorsed the  Proclamation “guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens”. The manesto was censored by the British authorities when it appeared in the newspapers but the full version was widely circulated. Press censorship was only one of the many forms of repression that the British used during the election. Hundreds of republicans were in jails  – including  of Sinn Féin.s candidates. Raids and arrests were frequent, as were bans on public meetings and among those arrested during the campaign was Sinn Féin Director of Elections Robert Brennan. His two predecessors, Seán Milroy and Dan McCarthy, were already in prison. British soldiers and loyalists had attacked  Harcourt Street on  November and subsequent nights, leading to the death from a stroke of ‘Nationality’ editor Seumas O’Kelly.  On  November the office was raided by a large force of armed Dublin politan Police who arrested Brennan and seized manestos and other election material. Acting Director of Elections James O’Mara wrote to the press: “Each arrest has naturally caused some disorganisation, but the cause of Irish independence will not be stayed or broken by such tyranny. Men have been, and will be, found who will fill the vacant places.” Nominations were due to close on  December. In North-East Ulster the Catholic bishops suggested that Sinn Féin and the Irish Party should not split the nationalist vote in seats where this would allow a Unionist to win. Sinn Féin proposed that a plebiscite be held among nationalist voters in these constituencies. Dillon rejected this in talks with Sinn Féin representative Eoin Mac Néill. The latter acceded to a call for the Catholic Cardinal Logue to propose a four-four ision of eight seats between the two parties. Others in Sinn Féin criticised Mac Néill for not adhering to his instructions. Sinn Féin candidates remained in the race in three of the four Irish Party-allocated constituencies but did not campaign and their voters were urged to support the Irish Party to keep the Unionists out. In taking this position the need to oppose the British threat of Partition was very much to the fore. When nominations closed it was realised that  outgoing Irish Party MPs were not contesting the election and in  constituencies,  of them in Munster, the Sinn Féin candidates were unopposed. Sinn Féin contested  of the  constituencies . Harassment continued right up to polling day with raids and arrests, seizure of Sinn Féin election material and removal of posters by British crown forces. After the death in Usk Prison, Wales, on  December of republican prisoner Richard Coleman, Sinn Féin campaigners wore black crepe on candidate badges. In The Four Glorious Years Frank Gallagher says a final election rally filled Dublins OConnell Street with speakers on several s, each flying a Tricolour with a black cross for Richard Coleman. He describes how on polling day Dublin dockers marched to the polling station behind an advance guard of Citizen Army veterans and hundreds of workers at the new British aerodrome at Collinstown – now Dublin Airport – went to the polls in a fleet of lorries flying Tricolours. The only two women candidates were both suffragists and  Rising veterans - Countess Markeivicz in the St Patrick’s Ward in Dublin’s South Inner City and Winred Carney in the strongly Unionist Victoria ward in Belfast. Markievicz was in Holloway Prison in England and her election address to her constituents she said:“I have many friends in the constituency who will work all the harder for me. They know that I stand for the Irish Republic, to establish which our heroes died, and that my colleagues are firm in the belief that the freeing of Ireland is in the hands of the Irish people today.”There was a two-week gap between polling day and the announcement of the final results on  December. Sinn Féin had won an overwhelming victory, taking  of the  seats in Ireland. Unionists won  and the Irish Parliamentary Party six . The majority vote for Sinn Féin was  per cent:  of the  Counties ed only Sinn Féin TDs. Of Dublins  TDs, all but one were Sinn Féin. The myth of nine-county Ulster being Unionist was exposed. Unionists polled a majority in Antrim, Armagh, Derry and Down but there were nationalist majorities in Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Constance Markievicz was the only woman elected in Ireland and Britain and would go on to be one of the first women government ministers in the world in the First Dáil Éireann. Preparations for that Dáil, the democratic assembly of the Irish Republic so strongly mandated by the electorate, began soon after the General Election that transformed Ireland  years ago. GENERAL ELECTION - MANIFESTO TO THE IRISH PEOPLETHE coming General Election is fraught with vital possibilities for the future of our nation. Ireland is faced with the question whether this generation wills it that she is to march out into the full sunlight of freedom, or is to remain in the shadow of a base imperialism that has brought and ever will bring in its train naught but evil for our race.Sinn Féin gives Ireland the opportunity of vindicating her honour and pursuing with renewed confidence the path of national salvation by rallying to the flag of the Irish Republic.Sinn Féin aims at securing the establishment of that Republic.. By withdrawing the Irish Representation from the British Parliament and by denying the right and opposing the will of the British Government or any other foreign Government to legislate for Ireland.. By making use of any and every means available to render impotent the power of England to hold Ireland in subjection by military force or otherwise.. By the establishment of a constituent assembly comprising persons chosen by Irish constituencies as the supreme national authority to speak and act in the name of the Irish people, and to develop Irelands social, political and industrial le, for the welfare of the whole people of Ireland.. Irelands claim to the application of that principle in her favour is not based on any accidental situation arising from the war. It is older than manynot all of the present belligerents. It is based on our unbroken tradition of nationhood, on a unity in a national name which has never been challenged, on our possession of a distinctive national culture and social order, on the moral courage and dignity of our people in the face of alien aggression, on the fact that in nearly every generation, and five times within the past  years our people have challenged in arms the right of England to rule this country. On these incontrovertible facts is based the claim that our people have beyond question established the right to be accorded all the power of a free nation.Sinn Féin stands less for a political party than for the Nation it represents the old tradition of nationhood handed on from dead generations it stands by the Proclamation of the Provisional Government of Easter, , reasserting the inalienable right of the Irish Nation to sovereign independence, reaffirming the determination of the Irish people to achieve it, and guaranteeing within the independent Nation equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens.Believing that the time has arrived when Irelands voice for the principle of untrammelled National self-determination should be heard above every interest of party or class, Sinn Féin will oppose at the Polls every inidual candidate who does not accept this principle.The policy of our opponents stands condemned on any test, whether of principle or expediency. The right of a nation to sovereign independence rests upon immutable natural law and cannot be made the subject of a compromise. Any attempt to barter away the sacred and inviolate rights of nationhood begins in dishonour and is bound to end in disaster. The enforced exodus of millions of our people, the decay of our industrial le, the ever-increasing financial plunder of our country, the whittling down of the demand for the Repeal of the Union, voiced by the first Irish Leader to plead in the Hall of the Conqueror to that of Home Rule on the Statute Book, and finally the contemplated mutilation of our country by partition, are some of the ghastly results of a policy that leads to national ruin.Those who have endeavoured to harness the people of Ireland to Englands war-chariot, ignoring the fact that only a freely-elected Government in a free Ireland has power to decide for Ireland the question of peace and war, have forfeited the right to speak for the Irish people. The green flag turned red in the hands of the Leaders, but that shame is not to be laid at the doors of the Irish people unless they continue a policy of sending their representatives to an alien and hostile assembly, whose powerful influence has been sufficient to destroy the integrity and sap the independence of their representatives. Ireland must repudiate the men who, in a supreme crisis for the nation, attempted to sell her birthright for the vague promises of English Ministers, and who showed their incompetence by failing to have even these promises fulfilled.The present Irish members of the English Parliament constitute an obstacle to be removed from the path that leads to the Peace Conference. By declaring their will to accept the status of a province instead of boldly taking their stand upon the right of the nation they supply England with the only subterfuge at her disposal for obscuring the issue in the eyes of the world. By their persistent endeavours to induce the young manhood of Ireland to don the unorm of our seven-century old oppressor, and place their lives at the disposal of the military machine that holds our Nation in bondage, they endeavour to barter away and even to use against itself the one great asset still left to our Nation after the havoc of the centuries.Sinn Féin goes to the polls handicapped by all the arts and contrivances that a powerful and unscrupulous enemy can use against us. Conscious of the power of Sinn Féin to secure the freedom of Ireland the British Government would destroy it. Sinn Féin, however, goes to the polls confident that the people of this ancient nation will be true to the old cause and will vote for the men who stand by the principles of Tone, Emmet, Mitchel, Pearse and Connolly, the men who disdain to whine to the enemy for favours, the men who hold that Ireland must be as free as England or Holland, Switzerland or France, and whose demand is that the only status befitting this ancient realm is the status of a free nation.ISSUED BY THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF SINN FÉINtest"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27506  ","story":" Aengus Ó SnodaighThe flu epidemic that swept across Britain and Ireland in  struck at the weak and elderly in society. Hundreds died and many more spent many weeks crippled in agony in their beds during the winter months.Richard Coleman was born in Dublin in , one of eleven Coleman children, most of whom were active in the Gaelic League. Brought up in Swords, County Dublin, Richard was a religious and a patriotic young man. He trained to be a Christian Brother, but left to begin a career with the Prudential Insurance Company.When Thomas MacDonagh came to Swords in April  to recruit members for the recently formed Irish Volunteers, Richard was among the first to join. When John Redmond forced a split in the Volunteers later that year, the remaining Volunteers elected Richard as their captain.On Easter Sunday , Richard mobilised his men, the Fingal Battalion, at Saucers Town, ensured that they were ready for what lay ahead and dismissed them till the following day. On Easter Monday they, along with other Volunteers from surrounding areas, came under the direction of Thomas Ashe, whose instructions were to prevent British reinforcements from reaching Dublin. They fulfilled that task heroically that week.On the Tuesday,  Volunteers were sent into the GPO in response to a request from the Commander-in-chief, James Connolly. On reaching the GPO, the group was split up. Six men became the tunnelling unit around the GPO - `the engineering corps - while the others under Richard were instructed to reinforce the garrison under Sean Heuston in the Mendicity Institute. Connollys parting words to them did not augur well for their mission: ``I dont think you will all get there, but get as far as you can.They got as far as the Mendicity Institute unscathed. A Volunteer at one of the barricades they passed through said of them: ``In the midst of the firing, men approached up Church Street towards our barricade. When they reached it, they passed briskly towards their objective - whatever it might have been. They were dressed and, I thought looked, like countrymen... I could not but admire very much they way they went into action.At the Mendicity Institute, the garrison was under severe pressure, with the British attack coming virtually from all directions. By Thursday, things were hopeless and Sean Heuston was forced to surrender to a much larger British force.They, similar to the other captured Volunteers, were corralled at the Rotunda Hospital for identication purposes. They were then court-martialled and sentenced. Richard was sentenced to death, though this was commuted to three years penal servitude.The sentenced prisoners were transported to Dartmoor Jail in England first and then ided up. Richard was sent to Lewis Jail in Kent. When they were released after a very successful campaign in Ireland and abroad for their freedom, each Volunteer was granted £ from the National Aid Fund in America to help them rebuild their lives. They all pooled their money and began the New Ireland Friendly Society, with Richard as a director and a trustee with a superintendents wage.Like many of the other released prisoners in June , Volunteer Richard Coleman of Swords travelled to Clare to help Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in their efforts to get Eamonn de Valera elected in the by-election.While there he addressed the first unormed parade of Irish Volunteers to be held since . For this, he was arrested and jailed for six months. While in Mountjoy Jail, he and the other prisoners went on hunger-strike, led by Thomas Ashe. Ashes death led to such a public outcry that the remaining prisoners were first moved to Cork Jail and then Dundalk Jail before being finally released.Richard was not to remain `at large for long and he was again arrested, along with many of the other republican leaders whod been active in rebuilding the Movement, as part of the British authorities `German Plot conspiracy.The prisoners were assembled first in Dublin Castle on  May  and were then ided up and sent to Usk and Gloucester Jails in Britain. Conditions were harsh in the jail and attempts were made to criminalise them with the order to wear prison unorms. They resisted and at the direction of the Home Office the prison governor, Mr Young, capitulated. On their first night in Usk, the internees won the right to free association, the right to receive and send letters, to smoke and to wear their own clothes.Despite their victory, the prison regime and their confinement weakened the men and with the onset of a severe winter, many succumbed to the influenza virus which had reached epidemic proportions, killing hundreds outside the prison walls. Richard was among a group of POWs struck down by the virus - they were left in their damp and cold cells for three days after the flu struck them down. On  December, a new prison doctor, Dr. Morton took up his new duties in the prison and immediately he diagnosed that Richard had now suffering from pneumonia and he had him transferred to hospital. He died a few days later on  December .Remembering the result of Thomas Ashes inquest - that the prison authorities were culpable - no formal inquest was allowed and when Richards brother arrived he was prevented from getting an adjournment of the local inquest so as to instruct a solicitor. The local inquest heard Richards brother state that Richard was a strong healthy man at the time of his arrest, while three fellow POWs attested to the insanitary conditions in the jail and that improper nursing contributed to his death. These statements got good publicity in the Irish press and added to the campaign to get the POWs released.Richard Colemans remains were released to his brother and were taken to Dublin where they lay in state for a week in St Andrews Church, Westland Row. Over , people filed past the coffin to pay their last respects. Volunteers in unorm formed a guard of honour during that time. A public funeral procession in driving rain from Westland Row to Glasnevin was followed by over , people. Three volleys were fired over the grave in Glasnevin Cemetery by six Volunteers despite a huge police presence. The size of the crowd prevented the police from moving against the Volunteers.Volunteer Richard Colemans death in an English jail, aided Sinn Féin campaign against Britains occupation and their general election campaign which was in full swing at this stage, and two weeks later Sinn Féin won a landslide victory of parliamentary seats. A month later in January  Sinn Féin MPs met as Dáil Éireann for the first time. The escape from Usk Jailby four of Richards comrades on the same day saw that republican POWs were unbroken and unbowed by their comrades death.Volunteer Richard Coleman died of pneumonia in Usk Jail on  December ,  years ago this week.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27507  ","story":" Michael McMonagle“This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account. - Chris Hazzard MPThe proposal from a senior Tory MP that the threat of food shortages in Ireland should be used to put pressure on the Dublin government and the EU in the Brexit negotiation exposes the colonial attitude of Brexiteers, a Sinn Féin MP has said. South Down MP Chris Hazzard was speaking after senior Tory MP and former minister Priti Patel urged the British government to use the threat of food shortages which could arise from a no-deal Brexit as leverage in the Brexit negotiations. The Tory MP, who previously stepped down from her ministerial role after revelations of secret meetings with the Israeli government, asked why the threat of food shortages wasnt being \"pressed home\" during the Brexit negotiations. Her remarks have sparked outrage on social media, with comparisons to Charles Trevelyan, the notorious British civil servant known for his role during The Great Hunger. Chris Hazzard said the proposal from the Tory MP were \"crass and offensive.\" “This proposal from Priti Patel really exposes the Brexiteer attitude to Ireland as nothing more than a colonial irritant whose rights really shouldn’t be taken into account.“They know the history of the Irish famine and Britain’s role in it and the very fact that they would seek to inject that into the Brexit debate is crass and offensive.“The Tories couldn’t care less about the impact of their reckless Brexit agenda on the people and economy of Ireland.

We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.I was asked to speak at this event because I am a woman ex-PoW. To my mind there is nothing extraordinary in that, because I am only one of many.  There are hundreds of women throughout this country who have endured imprisonment because of their republicanism – and who carry that past with pride. There are women around us today who have shown bravery that would be considered well above the call of duty in any other walk of le. And, there are thousands who have quietly lived their lives and never told anybody of the things they did to further republicanism.And today we’re here to honour the memory of Constance Markievicz, one of the most famous republican women in recent Irish history a woman revered equally by historians and revisionists, and a woman who believed in, and participated in physical force republicanism.Constance Markievicz didn’t give a second thought to taking up arms and declaring war on the British Empire. Neither had she any misgivings about teaching young Fianna members to fight and bear arms. And she is rightly hailed a hero for taking that stand but the same people who revere her would, in a heartbeat, condemn me and others like me, and would pour scorn on those women on our republican role of honour, and claim that there is a dference.But I wonder could they tell me the dference between Constance Markievicz, who stated in  that:And the words of Volunteer Mairéad Farrell when she stated in :And I would love those revisionists, who laud Constance Markievicz and condemn Mairéad Farrell, to explain to me the dference between the circumstances that drove republicans in  to strike a blow against the British empire, and of republicans in  and  who took up arms to defend small communities like mine – trapped on the fringes of loyalist east Belfast, subjected to sectarian pogroms, ignored by a British government and forced into a state that neither wanted or accepted us.Marie Moore, a native of Clonard, a veteran of republican struggle and Belfast’s first Sinn Féin Deputy Mayor speaking of her le of republicanism rememberedWhere were the revisionists when thousands were being burned out of their homes when frightened mothers were dragging terried children onto buses and trains and being forced as refugees across the border, hoping for help and safety in another state that had abandoned us, and that also neither wanted nor accepted us When those who revere Constance Markievicz’s philanthropy and work among the poor of Dublin are celebrating her le, do you wonderthey ever give a thought to what she would have done had she been there when the hundreds of refugees from ‘the black north’ poured off buses with their meagre belongings in battered suitcases Do they think she would have stood idly by and did nothing I know none of us can speak for the dead none of us know what the other would have done, but we know enough about her to come to our own conclusions and I would like to think that she would have been as much a leader now as she was then.Her commitment and her legacy was an example to young women like me when I was growing up in a war-torn Belfast. She inspired us. She gave us aspirations to live up. She set an example. And part of that example was to never back down.We knew her history. We knew she took up arms. We knew she was a commander in the IRA. And we aspired to be just like her.She was also a POW, and when young women were imprisoned throughout the conflict, in this State, in Britain and in the six counties, they knew they were walking in the footsteps of the women of . We were republicans in the mould of Markievicz. We were what we were. We are what we are. Unashamed, unrepentant republicans to this day and forever on.And no political opponent or revisionist will tell me, and all those thousands like me, that I should be ashamed of that.But the irony is, that the people who are so quick to condemn today’s republicans for taking the decisions we did, have never once considered what drove so many Irish men and women, young and old, to walk the hard roads we walked during these last  troubled years. We didn’t do for fame or fortune. We did it because it was the right thing to do.There are always reasons and circumstances behind people’s decisions and, we need as much today to consider those journeys, as we do the journeys of the men and women of . Circumstances and history shaped all of us. That’s undeniable.Throughout the decades republican women have been to the forefront of struggles in Ireland in the Suffragette movement, the Labour movements, the Gaelic League, and many other organisations – much as republican women today are deeply involved in every aspect of daily le and organisations working to better peoples’ lives.In every phase of the struggle, women have taken risks. From their involvement in the ’s border campaign, to those who broke the Falls Curfew and carried guns and ammunition out under their coats, in prams and in shopping bags. And, we know many too who lost their loved ones, and their own lives, to plastic, rubber and live bullets on active service for the IRA, and to loyalist and British State murder squads.We all know women who walked the streets wrapped in blankets, in bare feet, in rain and snow, to highlight the plight of the prisoners in the H-Blocks and Armagh who smuggled comms, love letters, and much more into and out of the prisons who marched in their hundreds to the steps of Stormont when Sinn Féin were locked out of talks, demanding their rights and representation.There are women who travelled every week, for years, to visit loved ones imprisoned in this state, in the six counties and in Britain, most times with young children in tow. The hardship of prisoners’ families is often forgotten, and imprisonment impacted on thousands upon thousands of people throughout this island, not just the prisoners themselves.Brave republican women stood as Sinn Féin candidates in the early ‘’s and ’s, when in councils throughout the six counties they were vilied and subjected to the vilest of sectarian abuse and threats of death.And I’m proud to say that the temerity of those who led the way has paid off in idends. Republican women were elected in their hundreds – councillors, MLAs, TDs, MEPs, Senators and including – dare I say it – three very proud and very capable women MPs are walking in the footsteps of the first female MP elected to sit in the British House of Commons the first abstentionist Sinn Féin MP, Countess Constance Markievicz.And still, there are people telling us today that our Sinn Féin MPs, elected by thousands of Irish citizens full in the knowledge that, like Markievicz they would not be taking seats or swearing an oath to a foreign government, should take seats in a British parliament, or better still, resign those seats and gt them to others who are more than willing to doff their caps and swear an oath to defend an English monarch. Do these people even listen to themselves These same people, who are lecturing us, will no doubt be lauding Constance Markievicz for her part in the birth of the nation, with all her history of abstentionism and of physical force republicanism.Do they genuinely not understand irony And do they think that our supporters, those who flock to the ballot boxes in their thousands toSinn Féin elected representatives, don’t aspire to the goal of Markievicz, of a democratic republic that cherishes all of the children of the nation equally Where is the equality for nationalists in the six counties  Where is the respect for the democratic mandate of thousands upon thousands of people who have yet to have their rights and entitlements respected in the British constructed and maintained sectarian six-county state  Where is the support for our democratic mandate  Where is the aspiration to cherish all of the children of the nation equally  Or do they not consider us part of that nation  They need to bear in mind that when the Proclamation was being written there was no border in Ireland – hard or soft.They also need to bear in mind that there is no single narrative to this conflict. Yes, people have been hurt, on both sides, and those who are trying to revise the history of the IRA of , are also trying to revise the history of the IRA of this phase of the struggle to present one side and one side only. As a republican woman I am proud of the rich history of Irish women that we can lay claim to, and many here today were part of that history. And I am proud and in awe of those women who lost their lives as part of that struggle.Unfortunately, throughout the decades of our troubled past people who know nothing about what we went through are writing and rewriting our history.We cannot allow the memories of our dead, the stories of nationalist and republican victims, and the history of repression and oppression that led to young people again taking up arms, in the same way Constance Markievicz and Tom Clarke and Pádraig Pearse and all those others in  took up arms, being airbrushed out of our history. And maybe one day we’ll be in a place where the circumstances that led to those decisions are acknowledged and accepted.Because, rest assured, not one of us woke up one morning and decided on a whim to take up arms, to put our lives on the line, to face imprisonment and death. There are always reasons why people make the decisions they do but some people just refuse to see or accept that.We know those reasons and we need no lectures from people who have not walked in our shoes. is something we should all aspire to.We have a duty to future generations to ensure that our revolution isn’t rewritten. We need to make sure that our young people know why and where our history of struggle comes from to remind, educate and to see that it never happens again to ensure that young women continue to be inspired by Constance Markievicz, by her bravery, her philanthropy and her work for those less well off. But we also need to ensure that the circumstances that led to her and future republican women seeing the need to take up arms, never happens again.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8734911.1544460417!/image/image.jpg","title":"jonathan rea honorary degree i feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it s nice to be recognised","story":"Four-time World Superbike champion Jonathan Rea has received an honorary degree for his outstanding contribution to sport.The Co Antrim racer received the honorary degree of Doctor of Lettersfrom Ulster University at its winter graduation ceremony.World Superbike Champion Jonathan Rea collects his Honorary Graduate from the University of UlsterOf the occasion at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast, he said: “It’s dficult to stand in a room full of highly educated people and receive an award like that when I haven’t gone to university. “But I have served my time.

My sacrice and dedication went to motorcycling and I’m very proud to be a Doctor of Letters because of that.“It’s a lelong sacrice. Since I was six-years-old I’ve travelled theand breadth of the UK racing. The injuries I’ve faced, the ups and downs, to actually win a world championship on top of all that is massive.“It’s nice that my family can see there was an endgame after all their sacrice in the beginning.Jonathan Rea shows off his new threads“It’s a very proud day for the whole family. Especially my two little boys , they realise that it’s not normal to be at an event like this. They know the ious race tracks inside out but this is dferent. I hope I can be a good role model for them.”The -year-old said it was the first time he had ever attended a graduation, adding: “I never imagined the first one would be my own.”Asked about his graduate attire for the ceremony, he said: “Of course I feel a lot more comfortable in leathers and a helmet but it’s really nice to be acknowledged outside the sport. It’s something that’s happening more and more recently.”The honorary degree follows the  award of an MBE on the New Year’s Honours list.

A recent survey of RCGP NImembers found that % of GPs surveyed are concerned their increased workload during the winter months will negatively affect their ability to deliver patient care. The college’s Patient Group is reminding people about the important ‘ Before GP’ message. Karen Mooney, chair, said: “This winter, we know that our GP practices are going to be under immense strain, and we can do our bit to help support our health service. Think about what you really need think  Before GP. “Can you care for yourself and manage minor ailments at home  Can you find the advice you need using safe and reputable online resources such as the NI Direct Stay Well website  Can you seek advice from your community pharmacist “We all have a responsibility to help protect our health services and to make sure that those who are the most ill and vulnerable in our society are able to access the care that they need.”Dr Grainne Doran, RCGPNI chair, said: “GPs strive to provide the very best care to all of our patients. Over the winter period, there is no doubt that our workload hugely increases. “For more minor conditions such as coughs and colds, patients can get great advice and over the counter medicines from local pharmacies.

The draw of playing with her friends a few metres away is just too much for her.“She loves to be involved in everything,# says Clotilde, #especially helping to prepare food and cook. She#s quick to learn.#The proud mum of four is thankful that Ines and her other children are growing up strong and healthy. She puts it down to a combination of a ied and nutritious diet and the help and advice of community-based health workers, carers and volunteers supported by international development charity Concern Worldwide.Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, where more than a third of the population don’t have enough food to eat. Poverty, political instability and scarce rainfall all contribute to high levels of food insecurity and hunger. And children, who make up around half the population, are disproportionately affected.What makes it even more of a challenge is that Clotilde and her family live in Cibitoke – an area with one of the highest levels of chronic malnutrition in the country. Every other child living there is chronically malnourished.Hunger prevents them from developing. It causes stunting and weakens their immune systems making them more susceptible to diseases. Their ability to grow and learn is permanently damaged. By the time they are two-years-old, the effects of chronic malnutrition are irreversible.The overall level of acute malnutrition in the area is also poor, with one in every  children moderately or severely malnourished. Last year, the UN estimated that as many as . million children in Burundi were impacted, with almost , under-fives requiring treatment for severe malnutrition.It is for that reason that aid agencies like Concern are targeting pregnant women, and mums with young children. The aim is to prevent malnutrition in the first place or spot the early signs before it takes hold.A few kilometres away, we meet another -year-old mum, Charlotte Nzeyimana. She has been walking for almost two hours carrying baby Keddy on her back and with four-year-old daughter Kyntia by her side.In the shade of a banana grove, Charlotte shares her concerns about young Kyntia, who sits motionless on the ground beside her. “My daughter is not very healthy,” she says.Seven months ago little Kyntia was diagnosed with oedema – a symptom of severe acute malnutrition. She was admitted to hospital and recovered after a month. But her situation remains precarious.“I breastfed her until she was three-years-old,# says Charlotte. #After that, she began to get sick. She has never had a ied diet – and has only ever eaten cassava paste.#In the next few weeks, though, Charlotte will begin to reap the benefits of the same vital health and nutrition advice and support that Clotilde enjoys.The programme, which started in July, is run by Concern with funding from the UK government. Last year, as part of the overseas charity’s Food in a Fragile World appeal, the public donated just over £, which was matched pound-for-pound by the government. That matched funding is now being used in this part of Burundi to help improve the lives of more than , under-fives at risk of malnutrition.At the heart of Concern#s efforts to tackle hunger is a team of  skilled Community Health Workers . They are trained to detect the early signs of malnutrition on the spot and treat certain illnesses and infections. Concern also supports , Care Group Volunteers and  Mother Leaders who promote breastfeeding and good nutrition, food preparation and hygiene practices.#We rely on our Community Health Worker,# says Clotilde. #She has treated my children for malaria and diarrhoea. Andthey fall sick again, she will know what to do.#Both Clotilde and her husband earn what they can from casual work cultivating cassava and corn. Between harvests and during lean times they sell eggs, buns, soap and home-made banana juice to friends and neighbours. It is enough for them to survive on.#The CHW has told us the importance of having a balanced diet,” she says. “We eat twice a day – mostly beans, corn, rice, cassava paste, sweet potatoes and vegetables.”On a steep hillside in Bukinanyana not far from where we met Charlotte, Community Health Worker Jeannette Icimanishatse is greeted by shouts and laughter. The -year-old grandmother is visiting one of ten households on her weekly rounds. It is clear that she has gained the trust and respect of her neighbours, encouraging them to take simple preventative measures to positively impact their children’s lives.“I am proud of what I do,” says Jeanette. “Mums depend on us for help. It is rewarding to know that we are doing something to make the le of the community better.”Community Health Workers like Jeannette refer any cases of severe acute malnutrition to the local health centre for specialist treatment. They even help to arrange transport and encourage mums to save a little for emergencies. Mothers whose children are moderately malnourished are enrolled in community-based nutrition demonstrations where they receive advice on key feeding and care practices. They are also given support to build a kitchen garden which enables them to have vegetables all year round, and an opportunity to be part of a savings and loans scheme.It is a highly effective approach, according to Sebastien Sebahizi, Concern’s Health and Nutrition Programme Manager in Cibitoke, because it focuses on behaviour change and peer-to-peer communication.“What we have observed,” he says, “is that some mothers in exactly the same living conditions have children who are healthy. We bring them into the programme as Mother Leaders and Care Group Volunteers, so that mums who are struggling can spend time with them and see how it’s done.”A further spin-off from tackling malnutrition at grassroots level is that less of a strain is placed on the therapeutic and stabilisation services provided by local clinics.“What we hope to achieve,” says Sebastien, “is to halve the number of childhood nutrition-related consultations in local health centres. That will ease the pressure on the system and enable medical staff to deal with more complicated cases.“But ultimately, our goal is to reduce childhood malnutrition and give more young children the opportunity to grow up healthy and well. It is something each one of them deserves.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"food bank demand in north belfast soars for yet another christmas","story":"THE demand for food for those in need this Christmas is as high as ever before after another tough year for many people in North Belfast.A year of drastic changes to welfare reform and the roll-out of the controversial universal credit in November has left more and more people in need of essential food products over the upcoming Christmas period.The annual drive by North Belfast Advice Partnership and Ligoniel Improvement Association is now on for donations for this year’s initiative to help local families across North Belfast.Sinead McKinley, who is helping co-ordinating this year’s food drive, said this year’s appeal is their most important ever.“This year once again we have been inundated with requests for food parcels and Christmas hampers,” she explained.“It has been a really tough year for families, with all the dferent changes to welfare policy on top of the higher cost of food and living generally and the uncertainty around Brexit, it means more people are in food poverty.“Utility bills are also getting higher yet benefits have been frozen for four years.“There is also the cruel Universal Credit which I believe has resulted mainly in an increased demand for the food bank.“People are on a five-week wait for the changeover in their benefits which has put them in debt coming up to Christmas. There is no mitigation payment for that crossover period because the Assembly collapsed before they could pass the legislation.”Started in , the local food bank drive resulted in a record number of people receiving hampers last Christmas, with a total of  hampers delivered to iniduals and families in need.Once again, Sinead is appealing for long-le food products, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products and festive toys and gts amongst the vital donations for this year’s appeal.“We want to build on last year’s successful food bank drive success which resulted in  Christmas hampers delivered to those in need.“This year we expect the demand to be much higher and we will continue to work with our partners in St Vincent de Paul, St Patrick’s Soup Kitchen, Haven Outreach and Oasis Food Bank on the Shankill to meet demand.“We want to maximise resources to support a bigger group of people. Food is always the priority – it frees up other money for them to pay bills and spend a few pounds at Christmas time.“Christmas hampers are vital so that local families get through the festive period. There are extra costs because more people are off and stay at home which means extra heating bills.“This year has been so tough for everyone, especially low-paid workers, those on benefits and those affected by universal credit.“It has been really bad.Unfortunately, it is a sign of the times that food banks will become the norm for so many people.“Universal Credit is so cruel and will continue to roll out to so many more people. Soup kitchens and homeless charities are a leline for people. It is a helping hand for people.“I would appeal to local people to once again support this year’s food bank appeal- people in North Belfast are so generous when it comes to donating at Christmas.”Items can be donated to this year’s Food Bank appeal by bringing them to the Wolfhill Centre in Ligoniel, or they can be dropped into a number of other community centres including Ardoyne Association , Ashton Centre , Tar Isteach , Vine Centreand Ballysillan Community Forum ."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"mcgurks first uvf target searched 48 hours","story":"THE bar that the UVF had intended to blow up before switching their sights to McGurk’s had been raided two nights earlier by the British army and patrons arrested and screened.Fteen civilians, including two children, were killed in the North Queen Street bar massacre on December  .Ciarán MacAirt, a grandson of two of the victims, unearthed the informationin secret military documents in the National Archives in London. This week marks the th anniversary of the atrocity.At pm on December ,  – two days before the McGurk’s attack, British soldiers of the nd Battalion Royal Regiment Fusiliersraided and searched the Gem Bar close to McGurk’s Bar on North Queen Street.Less than  hours later, loyalist paramilitaries of the Ulster Volunteer Forcetargeted the Gem Bar for a major bomb attack. The Gem Bar was suspected by the British Army of being frequented by members of the Official IRA.The one convicted bomber, Robert James Campbell, confessed that the UVF gang drove to the area to attack the Gem Bar.It is believed that they could not plant the bomb there as young men were outside the bar so the bombers drove around the corner and pulled up beside the side entrance of McGurk’s Bar instead. One of the bombers got out of the car and placed the bomb in the entranceway, lit the fuse and ran back to the car which then sped off down Great George’s Street.Ciarán MacAirt said: “It is horric to contemplate that the British Army believed that the Gem Bar was frequented by members and supporters of the Official IRA and had raided the bar, searched it and screened its customers before lting a half dozen men. The action resulting from these lts is redacted in the files. Then, two nights later, pro-state loyalist extremists targeted the Gem Bar but failed to get clear access so made the fateful decision to attack the soft target of McGurk’s Bar instead.“We also know from these files, contrary to what the police and Office of the Police Ombudsman reported to our families, the British Army within an hourhad linked the Gem Bar to the bomb attack as the files record that McGurk’s Bar “was close to the Gem Bar” – but the British Army’s description of the Gem Bar is withheld from the families even after  years after the atrocity.“I believe the redacted information records that the Gem Bar was a ‘Goulding’ bar which in British military parlance denoted its alleged affiliation to the Official IRA whose leader at the time was Cathal Goulding. The reason that it is redacted could be that it shows that the British Army had correctly considered the Gem Bar to have been the target and the bombers loyalists. This alone would undermine the botched investigations our families have endured until now.“We also know from the same file that a British Army bomb expert had reported that the seat of the explosion was clearly in the entranceway and not inside the bar as the police had lied to the public, so the bar was attacked as witnesses had testied. Finally, from this signicant new discovery, we now know for a fact that the British Army’s covert death-squad, the Military Reaction Force, was operating in the area with  RRF who had raided the Gem Bar and we had long suspected that it had facilitated and directed the bombers.”Niall Ó Murchú of Kinnear and Co.

We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratication. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.— Donald TuskDecember , Mr Varadkar held a telephone conversation with European Council President Donald Tusk on Monday afternoon ahead of this week’s meeting of leaders in Brussels.The Irish premier added: “Our approach is that we have a deal on the table, a deal that has the support of  Governments, negotiated over  months.“Our objective is to get the deal ratied by the House of Commons and that is what we will be working on over the next couple of weeks, giving the UK the assurances it may need but never compromising on the basic fundamental substance and written letter of the backstop.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37610293.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/graph.jpg","title":"survey reveals 65 in northern ireland would now vote remain and 60 think united ireland more likely","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Unlike the pro-Remain parties, there was no joint press conference. But in separate statements, the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and the TUV insisted that no unionist worth their salt could sign up to the deal and called for the backstop to be binned. Sometimes, a secret document doesnt live up to the speculation. This was not such an occasion.Geoffrey Coxs advice set off alarm bells in even moderate unionist circles. No wonder the Government wanted to keep it under wraps. It said the whole of the UK would form a single customs territory with the EU, but Northern Ireland and Britain would be there on dferent legal terms.Only Northern Ireland would be legally part of the customs union, following the full EU customs code. The European Court of Justice would continue to have jurisdiction over its compliance with those rules. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said: \"Goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to a declaration process.\"Northern Ireland will remain in the single market for goods and the EUs customs regime, and will be required to apply and comply with the relevant rules and standards,up regulatory ergence in the future.\"Britain would be \"essentially treated as a third country by Northern Ireland for goods passing from GB into NI\".The DUP is livid that despite all Mrs Mays pledges, economic and trade barriers would be erected within the UK - something it branded \"unacceptable and economically mad\". The legal advice said the backstop could continue indefinitely and that the drafting didnt provide for a mechanism that is likely to allow the UK to exit lawfully.Despite promises to the contrary from Mrs May and Secretary of State Karen Bradley, the TUV said Northern Ireland would be \"annexed permanently into the EU\".The Attorney Generals full advice, released yesterday, was \"more emphatic and plain than that dressed up for the summary\" in the House of Commons on Monday, Mr Allister said.\"The trap is clear. All of the UK for now is held in a customs territory with the EU but only Northern Ireland is legally part of the EU Customs Union, where we would stay indefinitely evenGB was released,\" he added.\"This is utterly incompatible with the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.\"Mrs May had previously stated the very arrangement that she ended up signing up to would be unacceptable to any UK Prime Minister.Mr Swann said while the Government tried to downplay unionist concerns as recently as last week when he met the Prime Minister and Cabinet Office officials, legal advice reinforcing those fears was actually sitting on their desks.\"What was the point in them spending the best part of a year saying that they shared our concernsall the while they were negotiating a deal that contains everything we were concerned about \" he asked.The UUP leader said Mrs May must stop \"flogging this dead deal\" and pursue alternatives. But nationalist parties and Alliance want her to do nothing of the sort. Sinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy said the backstop had been agreed by the Government and the EU, and the Attorney Generals advice changed nothing. \"It must be maintained and protected. It cant be derailed or undermined by the votes of Brexiteer MPs,\" he stressed.An SDLP spokesperson added: \"There will potentially be minor dferences between GB and NIthe backstop is required, but they will be minimal.\"This is not a secret, but any ergence is a consequence of Brexit and the extreme version of Brexit that the DUP insisted on pursuing. If the DUP cannot accept this consequence of Brexit, they should do the honourable thing and support a referendum on the deal.\"Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry said nobody should be shocked at the legal advice on the backstop, because \"its nature and purpose should have been evident to anyone following the negotiations over the past  months\".The backstop was needed to protect the Good Friday Agreement and to avoid a hard border, he insisted. Mr Farry didnt see it undermining the Union - it \"may create comparative economic advantages for this region\", he said."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to visit dublin for crucial brexit talks with taoiseach leo varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Jonathan Bell: I was disparaged and demonised just for telling the truth about my role in RHI scandal The RHI probe, which is led by retired judge Sir Patrick Coghlin, will hear closing submissions over three days from tomorrow. This will include a short presentation of the evidence already heard over  days, as well as oral submissions from lawyers representing three key players - the Department for the Economy, the Department of Finance and regulator Ofgem.Oral submissions will also be heard from some of the  iniduals and organisations who were granted enhanced participatory rights. These include Mrs Foster, former DUP minister Jonathan Bell, a number of the partys special advisersand some senior civil servants.Mrs Foster was in charge of the Stormont department that set up the flawed scheme.As details of the scandal emerged later, she faced calls to stand down as First Minister. When she refused to step aside, Sinn Fein collapsed the Executive in January .The public inquiry has since exposed internal rows between senior DUP members and the power wielded by unelected Spads, as well as how codes that set standards for public le were apparently ignored routinely to get business done.In a closing statement to the inquiry, during which Mrs Foster gave five days of evidence, her lawyer said it will be up to the  to determine the impact of a \"lack of ministerial input\" on certain key issues.Mrs Foster, who launched the RHI scheme in  when Enterprise Minister, previously admitted to the inquiry that she did not read the legislation she introduced to the Assembly in her name.She also said that she was \"accountable but not responsible\" for her former Spad Dr Andrew Crawford.Mrs Foster said Dr Crawford never raised allegations that the RHI scheme was being abused with her, or the potential for a spike in applications. She told the inquiry she now believes both of those issues should have been brought to her attention when she was Finance Minister in .In her statement last night, Ms Ellison said Mrs Foster had been \"clear that she is accountable to the Assembly for the failings that occurred within Deti during her tenure as minister of that department\". \"She has welcomed the inquiry as a means of establishing the facts of what went wrong with the scheme and how to ensure it does not happen again. \"It is clear, however, that there were many issues that were not raised to ministerial level for either information or decision-making. \"It will be for the inquiry to determine the impact the lack of ministerial input on certain key issues has had, and whether, in light of the issues that were not raised, Mrs Foster was in a position to have done anything dferently such that the schemes adverse outcomes could have been avoided.\"At the DUPs annual conference last month, Mrs Foster said her party was \"deeply, deeply, sorry\" for its handling of the RHI scandal, which saw the Northern Ireland taxpayer open to a huge overspend because the scheme paid out more in subsidies than the cost of the fuel, leading to a \"burn-to-earn\" incentive.Last night her barrister repeated Mrs Fosters apology \"for the mistakes made\" by her party in the handling of the failed green energy scheme and that the RHI crisis has been the former First Ministers \"biggest regret both politically and personally\"."},{"url":null,"title":"backstop must be removed arlene foster insists","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But Mrs May’s spokesman insisted she continues to believe that necessary preparations can be completed within that time.The Prime Minister held talks over breakfast with her Dutch counterpart, Mark Rutte in The Hague, which Downing Street described as “constructive”.Mrs May told the Dutch PM that “additional assurances” would be needed on the backstop arrangement to keep the Irish border open after Brexitthe deal was to get through Parliament.“The leaders agreed that the backstop was only ever intended to be temporary, the Prime Minister set out the concerns held by many about it in the UK,” said her spokesman.“She discussed the need for additional assurances on this point in order for the deal with the EU to pass the House of Commons. The Prime Minister and Prime Minister Rutte agreed to work together to find a way through.Mrs May then flew on to Berlin for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and was due to travel later in the day to Brussels for talks with Mr Juncker and European Council president Donald Tusk.The weekly Tuesday morning Cabinet meeting was postponed because of Mrs May’s travels and will now be held on Wednesday afternoon, when preparations for a no-deal Brexit will be on the agenda.Mrs May will thento Brussels on Thursday for the two-day European Council summit, though it was unclear whether she would be invited to join leaders of the other  member states when they discuss Brexit. Mrs May’s move to abandon a crunch Commons vote, scheduled for Tuesday, on her Brexit deal drew howls of condemnation from the opposition as well as a number of Tories.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Leading Conservative Brexiteer Steve Baker suggested that that PM had a “duty” to stand down in order for a new leader to deliver EU withdrawal.“What I would like to happen today is for Conservative Members of Parliament to realise that we simply cannot go staggering forward any longer like this and I’m afraid to put their letters of no confidence in,” Mr Baker told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.But Mrs May’s spokesman responded: “The Prime Minister believes it is her duty to deliver on the will of the British people and take us out of the EU.”Askedthe PM continued to have full confidence in chief whip Julian Smith, the spokesman replied: “Yes.”Mr Juncker won applause from MEPs as he said: “There is no room whatsoever for renegotiation, but of course there is roomused intelligently, there is room enough to give further clarications and further interpretations without opening the Withdrawal Agreement.I will meet @theresa_may this evening in Brussels.

Rather than taking back control, under the Prime Ministers Withdrawal Agreement, the United Kingdom would be trapped..pushThe Northern Ireland Protocol, set in international law, could not be exited unilaterally by the United Kingdom.It would continue indefinitely until superseded by another agreement.The Attorney Generals legal opinion is a devastating blow for the Prime Minister and those Cabinet ministers who are trying to sell the Withdrawal Agreement as a good deal.The publication of the legal opinion is a clear vindication for those of us who campaigned for it to be published.It is regrettable that we needed to use the Contempt mechanism to secure its publication. It did not need to be this way.Nonetheless, we now fully understand why the Government did not want to publish the Attorney Generals legal opinion.It flies in the face of what the Prime Minister told us on February  in the House of Commons.She said: \"The draft legal text that the Commission has published would,implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish sea, and no UK Prime Minister could ever agree to it.\"I will be making it crystal clear to President Juncker and others that we will never do so.\"Yet the Attorney Generals advice to the Cabinet confirms that the Northern Ireland Protocol would mean very dferent trading arrangements for Northern Ireland than the rest of the United Kingdom.A customs and regulatory border is precisely what the Government now propose.The Prime Ministers public and private commitments lie in tatters.Of course, it is important to rewind  months. It was this week last year when Arlene Foster telephoned the Prime Minister while she was in Brussels and urged her to bin the backstop.We pointed out the folly of the arrangement. We insisted on Paragraph  being added to the Joint Report to safeguard frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.Twelve months later, the Withdrawal Agreement has hundreds of detailed legal clauses about the Northern Ireland situation and the backstop, but there is not a single line and not a single word in relation to paragraph  of the Joint Report.That provision was inserted specically to allow that the final say in and decision on any regulatory dferences between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should rest with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive.It is deeply regretful that we have received no satisfactory explanation as to why Paragraph s commitment has been deleted.Conceding a fallback position to the EU before even starting talks about our final exit arrangements was always a bad idea.Too much time has been spent on negotiating this awful backstop. Even the ministers selling the deal dont like it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP, said on ITVs Peston on November : \"I dont think this backstop is a good arrangement for our economy. I dont think it is a good arrangement for our Union.\"So, its bad for the economy and the Union.And then the Attorney General, the Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox MP, said in the House of Commons on December : \"It has unattractive and unsatisfactory elements for us. I would have preferred to have seen a unilateral right of termination in the backstop. I would have preferred to have seen a clause that allowed us to exit.\"The words of the Prime Minister, EU commissioners and Cabinet ministers will come and go.They can be twisted and contorted to mean whatever one wants them to mean, but the legally binding text of the Withdrawal Agreement will remain.Our grandchildren will live with the outworkings of that international agreement.The Withdrawal Agreement will commit Northern Ireland to large swaths of EU single market rules for goods and agri-food.Of course, there are already regulatory dferences between GB and NI, but those were set for health reasons by our Parliament or NI Assembly, not because we were in a dferent single market regime.In such circumstances, our core industries would have their rules set by the European Commission and be subject to the European Court of Justice, yet we would have no say over them.It is utterly unacceptable, to me as a unionist, that Northern Ireland, in trade terms, would treat the rest of the United Kingdom as a third country.The Attorney General has confirmed this as being his legal opinion.We were told by the Prime Minister in her six declarations to the people of Northern Ireland last December that she would ensure that Northern Ireland left the European Union with the rest of the United Kingdom.She assured the public that no part of the United Kingdom would be left in the single market or the customs union and that no part of the UK would be left subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.These pledges have now been broken.We want a deal which works for the entire United Kingdom and delivers on the referendum result.We want Parliament to be sovereign for the entire United Kingdom.Rather than go through the process of debating and voting on this flawed deal, the Prime Minister should work for a better deal and bin the backstop.Nigel Dodds is the DUP MP for North Belfast"},{"url":null,"title":"irish employment level jumps by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Politicians are also conscious that dog fouling is a problem which does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.The new campaign is reminding dog owners that they should never allow their pets to foul on the street and that when out in public to carry a bag with them so they can collect dog dirt and dispose of it properly.Council chairman Mark Murnin said all councillors were unanimous in their support for the new awareness campaign.ldquoWe intend to monitor and extend this initiative over the coming months, he explained. Dog fouling is a serious matter and we need to remind dog owners that not only is it unacceptable, but also can potentially cause disease.ldquoIt is important that we develop and promote a culture of responsible dog ownership and are asking all dog owners to help us keep the parks and open spaces in the Newry, Mourne and Down area clean and welcoming for all users.As part of the new campaign, notices about dog fouling will be displayed prominently across the district to ensure that the local authorityrsquos message to pet owners is clear to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Classy Campbell seals victory  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH secured an excellent away win on the articial surface at Old Wesley as a strong second half performance was enough to get them over the line in a match strewn with penalties.lsquoHinch lost Rory Butler, James Simpson, Stuart Morrow to injury during the extremely physical encounter with Banbridge and, coupled with the unavailability of Johnny McPhillips, their midfield had to be rejigged completely with Callum McLaughlin and Robin Harte starting in the centre, outside fly half Hilton Gibbons.Tom Martin came in at lock to replace Simpson and the pack was bolstered by Tommy OrsquoHagan, who made his debut at tight head prop.

In recognition of the le-saving work, his employers named the air ambulance as its nominated recipient at the annual charity breakfast.March  began like any other for Damien but took a dramatic turn when he started his sht. His right arm became trapped above the elbow while working with heavy machinery, with the alarm quickly raised by one of his colleagues.Helicopter Emergency Medical Servicesparamedic Mike Patton was on duty when the call came through and quickly tasked the air ambulance to the accident with the crew joined at Carryduff business by the Fire and Rescue Service and Ambulance Service paramedics.Even though the builders yard was clear of obstacles, the landing proved challenging for the air ambulance due to the signicant amount of dust which was created as the helicopter came into land.Fire and Rescue Service personnel worked to release Damienrsquos arm from the machinery and were assisted by one of his colleagues who was also a former part-time firefighter and played an important supporting role during the incident.Throughout the entire ordeal, Damien remained conscious and remembers every moment right up until he was sedated mdash he believes his ldquomind blocked out the trauma.Once anaesthetised by a doctor, Damien was transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital by road ambulance, accompanied by the HEMS team, where he then underwent crucial surgery tometal plates into his arm.Damienrsquos road to recovery has been long, undergoing a further operation, overcoming two incidences of MRSA which required surgery, and a requirement for a Picc line to allow for regular antibiotic treatments by a team of dedicated rapid response nurses who called daily at his home over a period of  weeks.He is also likely to require further surgery.

I owe so much to the air ambulance HEMS team, the Ambulance Service and Royal Victoria Hospital for my initial care and treatment.Damien has also thanked staff at the Ulster Hospital and in particular Mr Harry Lewis, consultant plastic surgeon and consultant orthopaedic surgeon, Miss Denise Shirley.He continued: ldquoI firmly believe that it was their hard work and skill that has meant my story has had a more positive outcome.ldquoSince my arm has been saved I have been able toto work which is great as it was driving me mad sitting at home. The goal I am working towards now is to get as much usage back in my arm as I physically can.Damien said the air ambulance costs pound, per day to run so every penny really does go a long way to making sure this vital service can continue.He added: ldquoI was delighted when Carryduff Building Supplies nominated the Air Ambulance to benefit from its annual fundraising breakfast. Being able to raise pound, on the day was a phenomenal achievement and is the highest amount that has ever been raised at this event.

He was renowned for tackling a fierce hound with his bare hands. But feeling so bad after killing the hound, he asked the dogrsquos owner for a pup and promised he would train him up to be as good as his father.Setanta became known from that day on as Cu Chulainn mdash the Hound of Cullen.Mrs Donnelly has been instrumental in setting up a number of historical societies around Co Down.She adds: ldquoThe books are aids to help parents hand down our wealth of Irish folklore and the great legends of Ulster to another generation.

Colm arrived into the Shimna Suite to a tumultuous welcome ndash the sort of welcome only heroes get, the standing ovation, the shy bow of the head and of course the irreplaceable smile.He was among friends and worshippers. He spoke to his adoring audience and we lapped up every word. He spoke of his unease at the inidual honours he achieved as Gaelic football is a team game and that he achieved much on the shoulders of giants both in size and sheer ability. They gave him the  to achieve what he did.Colm said It wasnrsquot about Colm ndash itrsquos what others did for him. The unglamorous work, the blocking, the chasing ndash all the stuff we, as footballers do.The first video, mist and rolling hills ndash the early strains from the film many years ago ndash yip local hero.We all canrsquot be wrong. Wersquore all thinking the same way. In true lsquoThis is your lersquo style our compere for the evening, the classy one and only Austin OrsquoCallaghan eased Colm into his throne.He didnrsquot sit easy. Hersquos in the spotlight. Itrsquos not like the chair at home from which he was supposed to be watching the Late Late Show . As Colm said himself, before Mickey Cole got his tuppence in, saying it was about Colmrsquos level of viewing.There was laughter from the hall. Now, like all his years on the field, he is being watched once again. The evening will unfold. There will be surprises. He will forget himself, the nervous tension will go.He will relax into the throne ndash on one which he will wear a virtual crown. There was one thing missing ndash the big red book. This was duly delivered by Colmrsquos grandchildren, Eimear and Senan adorned in the Castlewellan and Liatroim Fontenoys colours.He got his biggest hug of the night from them. They probably whispered lsquowe love you grandarsquo to him. He would have known that.And so the story of his le began and it began with family. His sisterrsquos Mary, Nuala, Una and Dympna talked warmly of their brother. They spoke of the early days in Dublin, the near emigration to Australia and ultimately theirto Liatroim.In later years one newspaper headlined ldquoColm McAlarney ndash Dublinrsquos gt to Downrsquo ndash which we all know now is so fitting and thank God for that.The next sign of the hero status revealed itself though not a sporting one. Dympna told of how as a four year-old she misbehaved at Mass. As children wersquove all got the ldquowait until I get you home remark from a parent. When she got home, Colm being the big brother. gave her a big protective hug and all was forgiven by her parents.Stories of his early playing days were laid out by his friends Tommy Armstrong, Brian Malone, Gerry and Noel McCabe.Those days as young lads where they played in a field, set up goals and the youngesttold they were in goal. The humorous story of those times set the evening up well.We also heard from Willie Doyle and Colm Shields of those days in the mid-sixties when the young Colm was starting to make his mark on the Gaelic field. And so the flow of old playing colleagues from St Patrickrsquos High School, Downpatrick, with MacRory Cup memories, Down Minors and U-s of the day.In  Colm played for Down in three Ulster finals in the space of eight days mdash for the seniors, minors and U-s. A quite unique feat and a sign that perhaps greater things would come.Another unique fact was revealed. Colm played in four consecutive minor county finals, one with Loughinisland, one with Annaclone and two with Castlewellan. The great and the good continued to file passed.They told their tales of opponent, rival, colleague and what makes the GAA tick ndash friendship. We all know the headline stories, but it will always be the anecdotal tales behind the stories which give us all the biggest chuckles.Of course there was the glory years where we had Paddy Doherty, Sean OrsquoNeill, Gerry Dougherty, Kevin McIlroy, Donagh OrsquoKane, Barney McAleenan, Liam Sloan, Peter McGinnity, Sean og McGourty, Ray Carolan to name but a few.The little story from Liam Sloan, when back in , he received a call from the Ulster Council to seea trophy Colm won the previous year could be ed to be presented to the next recipient. Liam called to Colmrsquos house where Colm went looking for it. Imagine the scene, Colmrsquos backside sticking out from under the stairs, arm reaching back with each trophy saying ldquodo you think itrsquos that one.There were video messages from Kevin Moran, the great Mick OrsquoDwyer, Sean Cavanagh, Mickey Harte and then of course there was Joe Brolly, who wants to sit down and have a pint with Colm sometime.Colm could turn his hand to any sport. Basketball was always a preferred past time. What was revealed also was when he was at St Josephrsquos Training College was how he became involved in a wee bit of boxing.When members of the Immaculata Boxing Club came over from Divis to lsquoThe Ranchrsquo Colm took up the gloves. They were impressed by his skills. They wanted him to join the sport and even came to watch him play.The young Colm simply did not have the time to fit it in. The one good thing was that, as many of you will remember boxing skills came in handy in the Gaelic football arena back then. Better with the skill than without it.I cannot tell everyonersquos tale but perhaps one of the greatest footballers of all time, the great Kerryrsquos Jack OrsquoShea, paid Colm the greatest of sporting accolades by telling everyone he modelled his game on Colmrsquos.The second Gaelic football, box to box player, learning from the first and had Colm been a Kerry man ndash well you know how many All-Ireland medals hersquod have. This comment met with huge applause and nodding approval for our hero.Another milestone in Colmrsquos illustrious career, sometimes forgotten, was his foresight back then in  to introduce Saturday morning coaching sessions in Castlewellan for potential footballers between six and eleven years of age, a true testimony this practice is still thriving within the club some thirty three years down the road, all due to Colm McAlarney.The most touching tribute of the night came from his daughter Grainne. Hersquos dad and not the hero we know.He is the hero that is her dad. It was only in her early twenties she appreciated the GAA star her dad is. Sometimes, whenever she mentioned her surname, through the medium of her work with Danske Bank, there was then the silence and the pause, then the question, ldquoAnything to Colm  which she would answer with pride and a smile ldquoyes thatrsquos my dad.Hersquos first and foremost a dad. Sitting quietly and elegantly through the evening, watching the proceedings unfold and Irsquom sure bursting with pride, was Theresa, Colmrsquos we. Along with the family she kept the secret of what was months in the making.Her smile and perhaps a quiet reflection on a sporting le which she supported all through the years deserves recognition. Though, I suspect she would be like Colm in that that recognition doesnrsquot sit easy with her either.The final video of the night was delivered to the tunes of My Way and Simply the Best. This was a reflection of a career which spanned four decades. Perhaps most poignant of moments was the final montage from the  Down Senior Championship final where we saw a very proud Michael McAlarney with his son Colm and Colm Og with the Frank OrsquoHare Cup he spoke of bursting with pride of the two men beside him.Colm did it his way, but never to the detriment of others and he is simply the best. All the guests rose to their feet, once again, when the red book was handed over. The evening wasnrsquot over yet. There was another award. One from within his own club. Castlewellan chairman Kevin Sweeney, came to the podium and announced that Colm was the worthy recipient of the Castlewellan Hall of Fame award.Some of our previous proud winners were there to see Colm presented the Johnny OrsquoNeill Trophy by Johnnyrsquos son, our vice-chairman, John OrsquoNeill. Colm is now among a special group of people within our club.Well done to Kevan Owens, Kevin Sweeney, Gerry Dougherty, Liam Sloan and Barney McAleenan. This is the team who put the night together and they deserve our praise and appreciation.So, there you have it - the word hero ndash you know by now itrsquos a big one.Kitty Kelley said that a hero is someone we can admire without apology. I use the word unashamedly. By the way, that  year-old I mentioned at the beginning was the late Gerry Rushfrom the Bann Road. He was a very proud Fontenoy, my friend and a McAlarney man.JR went to his eternal rest in October , but his spirit was there on Friday night to pay tribute to a very special local hero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McNamara and Murray strikes send Olympic into raptures  ","story":"TWO goals in a mesmeric three-minute first half spell proved decisive as Ballynahinch Olympic secured their place in the Christmas showpiece final against Crumlin Star.Strikes from Niall Murray and Chris McNamara had Olympic purring, but they took their foot off the gas after the break and nearly threw it all away.Orangefield huffed and puffed for most of the second half, but a determined Olympic restricted them to a solitary strike from Vitalis Ogunwa in the th minute.There wasnrsquot much to write home about in the opening exchanges, but Olympic looked the more comfortable in possession with their fluid and ambitious -- formation.Orangefield had the first shot in anger when William Gracey had a shot from the edge of the box well blocked by the impressive Chris Magee. Owen Peden then had a header blocked as Orangefield had penalty appeals for hand ball waved away.Stuart Nelson had a shot comfortably saved by Ryan Walsh as Orangefield probed for an opening, but Olympic were nor for yielding.However, the east Belfast side committed a cardinal sin by ping their guard and affording the roaming Murray and Nathan Jones far too much space and time on the ball.Jones served notice of intent in the rd minute when he was picked out totally unmarked on the right side of the box, but he contrived to screw his shot badly wide.Three minutes Ryan Molloy instigated one of Olympicrsquos trademark moves when he released Murray. Without even having to look up to see his options, Murray immediately fed Jones, but Glenn Taylor denied him with a parried save.With  minutes gone and Olympic in the middle of a power play, Jones again found space down the right and played an angled pass in behind centre half Jonathan Doey that was latched on to by Murray and he beat Taylor all ends up with a sweet strike.It was - three minutes later. A sweeping pitch- move, started out on the left by the immaculate Dalton Tate, ended with Chris McNamara, who was involved in the build-up, converting a sublime pass from Jones.Jones could easily have made it - in the st minute, but his well-struck shot was tipped round the post by Taylor. Jones then played a brilliant ball into the path of Murray, but he was denied by an alert Taylor who rushed off his line to interceptTaylor saved from McNamara at the start of the second half, but Olympic strangely retreated into a defensive shell with Jones being starved of possession and Murray and McNamara being forced to live off crumbs.It was at this stage of the game that Ryan Noade really started imposing himself on proceedings and he revelled in providing protection to his back three with numerous, telling tackles and interceptions where it mattered.Orangefield were seeing much more of the ball, but they were never able to hurt Olympic.If anything, Olympic still carried a greater goal threat with Jones having a free kick blocked and Stevie Noade flashing one wide after Jones threaded the ball into his path.Orangefield managed to reduce the arrears in the th minute when Ogunwa beat the offside trap inside the box and drilled an unstoppable effort past Ryan Walsh.Despite applying intense pressure, Orangefield never looked like equalising and with the  minutes almost up, Olympic hit them on the break only for Murray to blast wildly over the bar with only Taylor to beat.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Chris Magee, Ryan Noade, Conor Reid, Jason Noade, Dalton Tate, Stevie Noade, Niall Murray, Nathan Jones, Ryan Molloy, Chris McNamara.

The scale of the crisis is quite simply breathtaking and the figures speak for themselves.Mr Savage said an estimated , applications had been made for social housing district-wide, with almost , of applicants placed in the urgent need category.He continued: ldquoThese figures highlight the terrible extent of the housing crisis in this district. Enough is enough, it is time for us to take action and time for everyone to put their shoulder to the wheel to tackle this mounting problem.ldquoThe conference is the first step in getting sustainable solutions at a time when the people we represent cannot get a place they can call home. The Department of Communities has an obligation to come and play a lead role because it oversees the Housing Executive and needs to hear first hand the level of need in the district and work with us all to provide collaborative solutions to the problem.Cllr Savage added: ldquoWe need to explore all the options. Access to a home is a fundamental human right and we need to act swtly so the current generation is not left without a place to live.Cllr Billy Walker said all elected representatives are approached about the lack of social housing on a daily basis and that not one of the part of the district is not affected by the current crisis.ldquoWe need this conference to pull all the key players together and we must be robust with them on this issue. We need solutions going forward and this conference is the perfect opportunity to do just that, he added.Cllr Davy Hyland said the council needed to do what it could to find solutions for people in desperate need of housing, while Cllr David Taylor said a lack of resources was not helping the housing crisis which had left people on the waiting list for several years in some cases.He added: ldquoWe need a new social housing strategy and need all the key players to buy into this. We also need funding to meet the demand which exists.Cllr Andy McMurray said he was ldquoacutely aware of the trauma associated with being on the waiting list for social housing, describing the waiting list figures as ldquopretty shocking, while Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly suggested the social housing crisis ldquohas gone well beyond crisis point.Cllr Willie Clarke described Newcastle as a priority area and warned that the current social housing shortage has the potential to get worse in the months and years ahead.He said there is a particular need for accommodation for small families, highlighting the problems social housing providers face when they have to compete with private developers to secure building land.Cllr John Trainor said that while work on a major social housing scheme was underway at the old Downe Hospital site in Downpatrick, it was important to plan for the townrsquos needs over the next five to  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Murlough runners in full flow  ","story":"ON a wet Saturday morning, some  Murlough AC members made their way across the province to Loughgall in Co Armagh to complete the third race in Born  Runrsquos Run Forest Run series.There is no other way to describe the day other than it chucked it down, our feet were well and truly soaked before the race began.

Children who are educated together create friendships which last for the rest of their lives, she continued.ldquoWe believe that there are more opportunities for children in integrated education which can provide them with a broader experience a safe, neutral environment where people can mix with each other and help us create a genuine, shared future for everyone.Mrs McAlpine explained the aim locally is to create the new steering group to take the post-primary project forward and write to existing controlled schools to testthey would be interested in transforming to integrated status.She said this would be a ldquofundamental change which may be dficult for some, confirming that existing schools preferred to maintain the collective status quo, the Mid Down steering group would adopt a greenfield approach for a new school.ldquoNICIE will be delighted to support parents in favour of new integrated post-primary provision as in all consciousness we cannot allow the current situation to continue as it is. You have around  children not being able to secure a post-primary place in the integrated sector and I think there is something we can do to redress the imbalance, she said.ldquoWe want to provide provide a much better future for post primary integrated education in the Mid Down area and hope to form a new steering group before Christmas and then contact controlled schools in the New Year to testthey wish to transform to integrated status.ldquoI have asked the Department of Educationwould it start a site search for me and I have an idea where a new school could be located but not a specic site. We currently have an integrated school at Blackwater in Downpatrick which I believe has never had the chance to reach its full potential as its site is quite restricted.Mrs McAlpine added: ldquoI am trying to get something that will enable us,the children would like to transfer, to get everybody on the same site and we would hope to have new post-primary integrated provision in the Mid Down area by , either in an existing school or via a new-build project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"New principal at Knockevin Special School  ","story":"THE new principal at Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick is looking forward to her new role with relish.While Sara Liddell has been acting principal since the start of the new school term, her appointment as Mrs Anne Cooperrsquos successor was only confirmedrecently and she says she is delighted to be at the helm of a school which has a special place in the heart of the community.Sara always wanted to work in special education and feels privileged to head up a school where work on a much-needed new extension is expected to start next September.The former Down High School student worked at Tor Bank Special School in Dundonald before moving to Knockevin, where she was a teacher and vice-principal for four years before taking over as principal.From Downpatrick, the new principal has a close link with Knockevin as her brother Jamie was educated at the school.ldquoI always wanted to work in special education and wanted to be here in Knockevin because it really is such a special place, said Sara. ldquoWhile I was studying at Stranmillis I did my teaching practice here which was lovely for me.ldquoThere is such warmth in the community for the school which has such a lovely, family feel about it. I obviously knew the school because Jamie came here and know how special it is. I wanted to work in special education because I saw what Jamie was able to achieve.ldquoJamie came through Knockevin and while he has his challenges, he was able to leave school and secure a job a few days a week which is great. My brother learned so much because he was educated here.ldquoThere is so much warmth about this place and I am fortunate to work with a wonderful staff team. Everyone, including pupils and families were so supportive to my family when Jamie was a pupil here. That sparked my interest in special education and was why I always wanted to work in this field, Sara explained.Knockevin is split across two sites, with an Early Years centre in Dundrum catering for  children and  pupils based in Downpatrick with a - strong teaching staff across both locations.ldquoWe are the only special school for a wide geographical area and have pupils coming from as far away as Kilkeel and Newry, with others closer to home coming from the Downpatrick, Ardglass, Strangford, Crossgar and Killinchy areas, the new principal continued.ldquoI am looking forward to my new role and already knowing the staff, pupils and families has been a big help. Knowing I have their genuine support is really wonderful.Given that it is the only special school in the local area, Knockevin is oversubscribed, with Sara explaining her appointment coincides with what she described as a ldquochallenging time.She continued: ldquoWe have a good reputation which has been enhanced with the new early years centre in Dundrum which is a real centre of excellence and we have huge numbers coming through, she continued.ldquoWe are pushed for space in Downpatrick, but Knockevin is in the school enhancement programme and work on a new extension will hopefully start next September, replacing mobile classrooms with a new permanent structure and it is a really exciting time to be part of this.Tendering documents are currently being prepared ahead of the start of building work which is expected to take  months to complete to meet what the new principal described as a ldquohuge need in the area.As Sara settles into her new role, she admits the fact she was vice-principal for four years has made the transition a smooth process.ldquoThere is so much love and warmth for the school across the community and local people are fantastic. May aim moving forward is to harness that warmth to give our pupils lots of new opportunities, she explained.ldquoWe already have a fantastic work experience programme where seniors go out and so many businesses have been so supportive. This is something I really want to build on, strengthening our school links.ldquoWe have been involved in a few projects with the Assumption Grammar in Ballynahinch and St Patrickrsquos Grammar in Downpatrick which produced benefits for everyone involved. As a former Down High student I have been able to establish a link with its student council which is really beneficial.Sara believes that linking Knockevin with other schools is important as it provides young people with an insight into what a special school is ldquodemystying the issues around it. She is also pleased her students can attend other schools to use a range of specialist facilities which provide access to art and drama, science and technology in particular.ldquoIt is amazing how other schools have opened up to us. We are delighted with their support which I believe says a lot about this area. Our staff and parents are also very committed and we are involved in a shared education project with Sacred Heart Primary in Dundrum.Sara added: ldquoOur neighbours at St Colmcillersquos Primary School are also supporting us with the P pupils selecting Knockevin as their chosen charity and when some of the pupils visited us recently they used makaton signing to communicate with some of our students.ldquoI am lucky to be the principal of a school which enjoys the warmth and support of so many people.

There will also be tea and refreshments and open invitation is extended to people to attend. Organisers say the service is open to all, not just those who have a relative who took their own le.Ailish Teague, who helped establish Le Change Changes Lives with her husband, Manus, said the service will be held in the charityrsquos new home for the first time.ldquoIt is a joint service organised alongside PIPS and it will be the third we have organised. PIPS initially came up with the idea and asked could they use our new premises which we were delighted to make available, she explained.ldquoThere has been a very good response over the past two years, with the service an evening where people can join together in their grief and remember loved ones collectively. Relatives are alongside others who have experienced the same pain and there is a lot of empathy and understanding.Ailish said the service is open to people from across the district and explained that there will be an opportunity for people to place the names of their loved ones on a Christmas tree.ldquoPeople are given as much time as they need and this can, for some, be a cathartic experience. We place peoplersquos names on skeleton leaves which we make. We chose leaves to reflect how fragile le is, while some people will bring a bauble to hang on the tree which has a picture of their loves ones on it, she continued.ldquoWe will also have a bigger tree this year more as more people have been attending as suicide figures continue to rise. It is always a very emotional service and there are very few people who donrsquot know some family that has been touched by it.Ailish explained that all the names placed on the tree this year will be kept and placed alongside those gathered over the past two years with the intention of placing them in a time capsule at some point in the future which will be buried locally.She continued: ldquoChristmas is a dficult time for families and that is why we do not decorate our tree located at the front of our building which looks out on to Market Street. There is no tinsel or lights.ldquoThis time of year can be troubling for many families and we choose not to decorate our tree which is much like the empty chair in many peoplersquos homes as their loved ones are no longer here.Ailish said the tree is decorated by those who have lost their lives, not through suicide, but due to mental health problems and addictions, highlighting the importance of people recognising this.She added: ldquoIt is depression that kills, not the selfish act of an irrational mind. People think suicide is a selfish act, but it is not.ldquoWe are extending an open invitation to next Thursday eveningrsquos service and people who have lost loved ones, regardless of the reason, are welcome to join us.ldquoWe would like them to join us and place a small decoration on the Christmas tree in memory of a loved one. If they do not have a decoration, we can make one for them.

For the past few years we have been unable to tell Tourism NI or Bord Faacuteilte when our festivals were likely to take place as the local authority does not even have a calendar of events looking forward.ldquoMost festivals run at the same time each year in the Down area and it would not be a dficult task to publish a calendar that would cover a five year period to include both council tourism and community-led events.Cllr Enright believes the introduction of such a calendar would have several benefits, ensuring there would be no overlapping of festivals in the same area, allowing Tourism NI to be aware of them well in advance and local festivals and events appearing in their brochures and in tourism offices at home and abroad.Gerry Casey, from the Ardglass Festival Association, described the current funding mechanism in place for community festivals as ldquoinadequate.He continued: ldquoVillages cannot plan ahead with such short-term annualised funding. The process in the new council makes funding for these festivals precarious and uncertain from year to year and inhibits festival organisers booking in advance to get best prices or being able to secure match funding from where.ldquoThe Ardglass festival has been running for  consecutive years and been funded for  of those. Over the past two years, ours was one of the community festivals that had been unsuccessful in securing council funding.Mr Casey added: ldquoAs we approach our th anniversary, it would be a boostwe knew we had funding in good time, allowing our festival to be included in tourism brochures next year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/9101825.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"nuj calls for psni investigation into film makers trevor birney and barry mccaffrey to be dropped","story":"The  documentary by Mr. Birney and Mr. McCaffrey broke new ground by publicly naming those it said were suspects.No one has ever been convicted for the killings.They were applauded by a crowd of around  journalists who gathered to show solidarity as they arrived at the Police Service of Northern IrelandrsquosMusgrave Street station in the city centre.ldquoThis is an extraordinarily important day for press freedom in Northern Ireland, he said.ldquoThis is about press freedom but more importantly itrsquos about the Loughinisland families.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valIan Paisley is tonight mired in yet more controversy after the revelation that he took another luxury holiday to an Asian country after advocating on behalf of its regime.The trip, which the DUP MP said he partially paid for, was part-funded by a mystery friend who Mr Paisley declined to identy.The North Antrim MP said he had paid for part of his Males holiday but refused to tell BBC Spotlight who had paid for the rest of the tripThe holiday for the entire Paisley family was not registered in the House of Commons register of members’ interests.The revelations in a BBC Spotlight programme broadcast on Tuesday night come just a fortnight after the North Antrim MP ed from the longest ever suspension from the House of Commons.That suspension of  sitting days came after it was revealed that he took luxury holidays from the Sri Lankan government and then advocated on behalf of a regime which was facing allegations of war crimes.Mr Paisley told Spotlight that he did not need to declare the foreign holiday and that the trip had not been paid for by the Malian government.The MP, his we and his two sons stayed full-board for five days in October and November  at a luxury resort on one of the coral islands in the Indian Ocean famed for sandy beaches and blue lagoons.Gavin Millar QC, a legal expert on parliamentary rules, told Spotlight that the Nolan principles on standards in public le placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he has not registered the trip.Mr Millar said: “MPs should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.“Now his decision in this case was not to register the benefit, after the trip in late , and he has an obligation to give reasons for that decision.“My judgment in this instance given the issues that have been raised is that unless he can come up with some wider public interest argument for not saying more, he should be saying signicantly more about any considerations that are relevant to the motive of that source in paying that money.”Mr Paisley told Spotlight in a statement: “I have responded in clear and categoric terms to your questions.“For the record, the government of the Males did not organise or pay for my family vacation in , which I do not intend to go into with you. I’m satisfied the vacation did not have to be recorded on the register.”Diane Dodds speaks from locked-down Strasbourg restaurant amid gun rampage in city Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Spotlight said that it had evidence which included an image which appears to be from the resort’s internal records and which suggests that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of Mr Yameen’s government.Spotlight said the evidence suggested that wasfacilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy, a former minister in the Males government.Mr Paisley said there was no link between the government of the Males and his holiday.Spotlight said that last week the MP had told it that he had discussed the holiday in the Males with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his Sri Lanka holidays.He claimed that it was on foot of that interaction that he was content that there was no need to register his holiday to the Males.However, the BBC said that after it contacted Ms Stone’s office Mr Paisley contacted Spotlight to clary that he had not in fact spoken to the commissioner about the matter and that he had instead spoken to the parliamentary registrar, an administrative member of the Commons staff.It is the sole responsibility of an MP to register any declarable interests.Mr Paisley told Spotlight he had evidence which “categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government”. Mr Paisley provided an email from Ahmed Shiaan, who was the Malian Ambassador to the UK in , in which he said the holiday had not been paid for by the government of the Males.A second email, from the resort’s commercial operating officer, Andrew Ashmore, said that invoices for the Paisleys’ stay had been settled and paid for privately. He did not say who had paid the bills.Four years ago, Mr Paisley emerged as the UK’s most expensive MP, claiming £, from taxpayers’ money for running his office, travel and accommodation. He said they were “unavoidable costs that an MP incurs whilst running a busy constituency office and commuting to Parliament” and that “none of this money goes to the MP”. Ian Paisley’s trip to the Males came eight months after he was part of a controversial parliamentary visit to the idyllic islands.At that point the Males government, headed by President Abdulla Yameen, was being criticised by organisations including the United Nations and the Commonwealth for human rights abuses.The Indian Ocean group of islands is also one of the world’s most notorious regimes for restricting religious freedom – something on which the DUP is outspoken. Beach idyll where regime jails religious convertsIan Paisley’s trip to the Males came eight months after he was part of a controversial parliamentary visit to the idyllic islands.At that point the Males government, headed by President Abdulla Yameen, was being criticised by organisations including the United Nations and the Commonwealth for human rights abuses.The Indian Ocean group of islands is also one of the world’s most notorious regimes for restricting religious freedom – something on which the DUP is outspoken.Only one faith, Sunni Islam, can be practised publicly and Malians suspected of converting to Christianity from Islam have been imprisoned.The DUP man was part of a delegation of MPs which travelled to the Males in February .The £, bill for the trip was paid for by the controversial Males government.A subsequent report in The Independent questioned the MPs’ decision to make what it described as the “luxury trip” with business-class flights and nights at a salubrious resort, during which they defended the Males government.Mr Paisley, who spoke out against economic sanctions, told a press conference in the country: “If people are suggesting we are having our strings pulled by others, they don’t know very much about me or my colleagues.”With the other two MPs, he also visited the prison where opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed had been held, and described the conditions as quite luxurious.Mr Paisley had previously travelled to the Males for three days in May  “to meet the president and vice president to discuss human rights” and other matters, with the £, cost of the trip paid for by the Males government.Both trips were properly registered in the Commons.try catch  TrendingPSNI issue warning to O customers seeking refund after network outageWhat we know so far about the man shot dead outside N.I. schoolFatal shooting: Man gunned down outside schoolO compensation package revealedN.I. boymissing - PSNI concerned for his safety missing - PSNI concerned for his safety\"          ..

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This will enable those who canrsquot make the Valersquos Daytime meeting to be informed and wersquoll offer help and explanationsneeded.ldquoItrsquos vitally important everyone makes their comments loud and clear in writing to the Vale Council at this time.ldquoWe need to drive home that a by-pass option is accepted through to the next stage of the process. It will be no use people moaning later.ldquoOf course multi-modal proposals can have their place but it is unrealistic to suggest they would ever solve the traffic congestion problem through Dinas Powys without a by-pass and without better park and ride facilities.ldquoBuses are currently used by just two per cent of commuters. Itrsquos no use putting more on the roads without removing some of the current commuting traffic, he said.ldquoDespite all the talk of rail and tram improvements there isnrsquot any scope to increase the minimal park-and-ride facilities at Eastbrook and none at all at Dinas Powys.After the Public Consultation, the WelTAG Draft Stage  Report will go to the Vale Cabinet.Members will probably ask their Scrutiny Committee for Environment and Regeneration to give their opinion.The Steering Group is also seeking to engage Ken Skates AM, Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Transport in talks that could involve private sector developments to help fund a by-pass.But theyrsquove been put on hold awaiting the Stage  report. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is these very services that are now under threat as a direct consequence of year on year under funding.As the proposed cut to the Valersquos budget is below the  per cent threshold, the authority will not receive any further support during the settlement process, Councillor Thomas says.Councillor Thomas says the reduction of pound.million ldquoignores the impact of inflation on council budgets. He said the impact of pay inflation on the council next year will be pound.million..The Vale council is also facing unfunded cost pressures in   of pound.million due to changes in the pension scheme for teachers.Providing for growing numbers of pupils with additional learning needs, and also complying with new Welsh Government legislation, would also cost the council an extra poundmillion which is also unfunded, Councillor Thomas says.Vale councillor Bob Penrose also added that school cutbacks ldquoare inevitable.Cllr Penrose said: ldquoIn July UK Government announced a . per cent rise in teachersrsquo pay which would cover England and Wales.ldquoThis was followed by the announcement of a  per cent increase in employersrsquo contribution to teachersrsquo pensions.ldquoWhat was lacking was an explanation of how this would be paid for.The council has set out its initial budget for  , which says the authority would need to find an additional pound,, in savings next year.That would be on top of pound,, cuts which have already been planned ndash which include a one per cent funding reduction for schools across the Vale.A council tax rise of . per cent for each of the next three years had been assumed in a provisional financial plan published by the council in September. The final level of council tax is not expected to be set until early in .But the council says raising council tax would only cover a small amount of the money it needs to balance the books. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Craigavon Manager Jenner Fearon said: “It is unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position after our long association with the Citizens Advice brand. From December we will be changing our name to Community Advice Craigavon. For us it is ‘business as usual’.“We have been in talks with Advice NI since the summer and are looking forward to working with our colleagues in the independent advice sector and at Advice NI. We have already moved to a new case management system and we view this as opportunity to improve and develop. We will continue to focus on helping our clients who are experiencing increasing pressures as a result of welfare reform changes and the universal credit roll out. We are grateful for the continued support of the Department for Communities, ABC Council, the Southern Health  Social Care Trust  Macmillan Cancer Support. “We offer help with welfare benefits advice, completion of forms, advice on employment law, consumer rights, housing problems and immigration law. We also have a dedicated debt advice service, guidance on private pensions via the Pensionwise Service  tribunal representation. We have a Macmillan Benefits Service which operates out of Craigavon Hospital for clients with cancer and family members. “We have been able to set up a digital area in our Lurgan office at Mount Zion House.

Here Emma Deighan scours some of the top NI venues to see how they are catering to the corporate Christmas Arguably the most anticipated social event in the work diary, the Christmas ‘do’ has evolved over the years.And many of Northern Ireland’s top hosts agree and have widened their offering in response.Event managers and venue owners say everything from the format of the Christmas party to its timing have changed to accommodate the demands of employees today. How, when and where we celebrate are top priorities.Take the evening do, for example. For many, that age-old three-course setup doesn’t cut the convenience factor, prompting my employers end the work day early to take advantage of lunch dates. It’s a favourable move that delivers on two fronts – it offers time-poor workers the relief of a shorter day but doesn’t infringe on family obligations.Owner of Bishop’s Gate Hotel in Derry and former president of the Northern Ireland Hotel’s Federation, Ciaran O’Neill agrees. “Christmas has changed over the last number of years for our industry with more businesses looking for lunches, as opposed to the traditional party nights of old,” he said. “We do still have ‘big nights’, but these tend to occur on Fridays and Saturdays.”Ciaran says he has also noted an increase in smaller party sizes over the years.“We are seeing less private large events and more small groups dining with us. Employees are arranging ‘get togethers’ with colleagues or teams that they work directly with.”Bishop’s Gate, which has become Derry’s hospitality jewel attracting the AA Hotel of the Year- accolade, among many other awards, pairs an historic setting with parties for Christmas.The Bullitt Hotel in Belfast is setting the scene for the experience-savvy hipster workforce – and this Christmas Bullitt’s ‘experiences’ reflect the discernment of its guests.General manager at Bullitt, Michael Sullivan has seen a spike in ‘experience’ events, upgrading the turkey feast to a cooler, more casual event.“We have had a number of enquiries for informal gatherings in our Good Room event space, with a festive lunch to follow. The Good Room is the perfect space to blur the lines between work and play for intimate company get togethers ahead of a more traditional Christmas do,” he said.“We’ve also had enquiries for private gin and whiskey tastings and can also organise a number of unique events and team-building activities for groups, from candle-making to chunky knitting workshops for a truly memorable Christmas party.”This December Bullitt has a range of packages to suit private and shared s – from sit-down meals in its restaurant Taylor and Clay to VIP packages in its Baltic Bar or secluded enclaves above in Babel – its rooftop bar. And its ‘Tipsy Tea’ is geared towards the day-time revellers. Prices range from £. to £. a head.“Bullitt has brought something new and exciting to the traditional Christmas party market, with a range of novel spaces set within cool, contemporary surroundings. We like to think that we’re helping to shake up the scene somewhat by offering something a little dferent,” Michael said.If you want to push the boat out with your corporate squad, Titanic Belfast is ready for boarding. Its play on Belfast’s shipbuilding heritage and the fateful Titanic is always a crowd pleaser. Laura Cowan, head of sales at Titanic Belfast said: “We host bespoke private Christmas party nights, which are tailored to our clients’ needs across all of the Titanic venues – Titanic Belfast , SS Nomadic and the Titanic Exhibition Centre. “These can range from private dining, iconic tailored experiences, drinks receptions and gala dinners. We also host our traditional Christmas party nights – featuring a Christmas cocktail reception on arrival followed by a delicious four course banquet and live entertainment.”For sheer luxury, the more refined office workers take to the Cathedral Quarter in Belfast to sample the Merchant’s opulent offering.And Clare Mullin, meetings and events manager there, said the hotel’s renowned afternoon teas are bucking the turkey dinner trend but are every bit as fancul. “Over the years we have seen an increased demand for Christmas parties and festive events that offer something a little dferent, memorable or exciting. People increasingly seem to be looking for something out of the ordinary.“We have seen a trend for corporate bookings where companies are looking for alternatives to a traditional evening dinner. For example, our Festive Afternoon Tea is very popular – especially the Champagne iety. Festive drinks in our famous Cocktail Bar continue to be a popular option for the corporate market too, with bespoke offerings such as our Redbreast whiskey flight extremely popular. gtClient lunches in The Cloth Ear and Berts Jazz Bar are also growing in popularity.”Casual begins in its neighbouring Cloth Ear from £. a person, retro at Berts Jazz Bar will cost you £. for lunch or £ for dinner.For private s The Roof Garden Alpine Lodge at the Merchant can cater to  and for the more luxurious three-courses will be served in the Rita Duffy Suite for £ a person.The newly revamped and extended Ten Square is another setup that combines afternoon tea with tradition.Swapping caffeine for mulled wine and pastries for mince pies, Ten Square’s Loft, located on its top floor and flaunting some pretty impressive city centre views, plays the backdrop to this year’s festive afternoon teas at £ a head, from pm to pm.It also offers more familiar packages in its Linen Hall suite where tradition mingles with s DJs to live bands.And for those who really want to go that extra mile, Belfast’s newest Hastings sibling is ready and waiting.The Grand Central Hotel on Bedford Street boasts unrivalled views from sky-high Observatory, where afternoon tea takes on a Christmas theme or tradition can be celebrated at its Seahorse Restaurant and ground floor Grand Cafe. Allyson McKimm, events director of Hastings Hotels said expectations for hospitality environments to up their game get higher every year.She said Hastings Hotels had “reached new heights this year to keep the format fresh and exciting with new entertainment and new twists on the menus and lots of exciting extras including the traditional and limited edition Christmas ducks.”Allyson said a growing trend for lunch events inspired Europa’s ‘Christmas Caberet Lunches’ with Motown entertainment. The live tribute act theme travels across its entire portfolio. “Once again, our guests have asked usthey could continue the celebrations after Christmas once the party season is over, and to meet this demand, we have launched a whole range of tribute shows between Christmas and the New Year at all venues including ever popular All American Buffet with Elvis at the Europa, Jersey Guys, ABBA and our favourite George Michael and Robbie Williams Tribute Show at the Ballygally, Stormont and Everglades Hotels.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/john1.jpg","title":"majority of ni firms expanding workforce in ","story":"Posted on Friday  November  by John Mulgrew More Northern Ireland firms say they will take on new staff next year than compared to the UK as a whole, according to a new survey. Recruitment firm Hays says among NI-based employers, % said they expect to hire additional staff in the next year, compared to a UK average of %. That’s the highest percentage in the last five years. Meanwhile, % of firms polled said they had experienced some form of skills shortage within the past year, against a UK average of %. The survey also showed that some Northern Ireland employers are finding it harder to recruit staff, due to lower levels of unemployment leading to a rise in wages. John Moore, managing director of Hays in Northern Ireland, said: “Employers in Northern Ireland told us they are pressing ahead with business plans and are generally optimistic about the wider economic climate for the next two to five years. Recruitment expectations are at their highest levels for five years, for both temporary and permanent roles. “Increased competition for talent coupled with skills shortages has helped support above UK-average salary growth in Northern Ireland. While that is positive for those seeking new employment it also has downsides, including negative impacts on productivity, staff morale and the ability to deliver projects. “Given the intense competition and, at times, unrealistic salary requirements from candidates, it’s never been more important for employers to understand the complex factors that influence employee movement. “Salary is still a top consideration, but candidates are now influenced by other benefits, such as le balance and career progression opportunities. However, only % of employers surveyed saw work le balance as a priority, compared with % of employees.” The survey is based on responses from almost , employers and professionals working in a range of industries, including almost  in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/chamber_1.jpg","title":"outline your alternative to brexit deal says ni chamber president","story":"Posted on Thursday  November  by John Mulgrew It’s now time for political leaders opposed to a draft withdrawal agreement on Brexit to “outline alternative proposals” as an overwhelming majority of Northern Ireland’s business community back the plans, an industry leader has said. Ellvena Graham, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said Prime Minister Theresa Mays deal on the table is “definitely much better than a no-deal scenario”. “After a long period of negotiation we now have a draft Withdrawal Agreement which is undoubtedly a welcome step forward for the majority of businesses in Northern Ireland,” she said. “We want the outcome that’s best for businesses, for consumers, for the economy and for the future stability of Northern Ireland – and we’ll do everything we can to ensure that we get it. “We therefore encourage our political representatives who support the draft agreement to do everything in their power to influence political representatives in Britain to join them. “For those that are not in support of the draft agreement, it is now time to outline your alternative proposals. We are willing to listen.” Ms Graham was speaking at the NI Chamber’s President’s Banquet at ICC Belfast. And as Northern Ireland approaches two years without a devolved government, she said that while there is a “vibrant and innovative business community that wants to invest and grow” that it is “stymied because of the prolonged absence of a regional government and the endless Brexit bickering”.

It really is a fascinating mix of the old and the new.“With high ceilings, exposed brick feature walls, high quality wood flooring and the strikingly restored staircase from the entrance lobby, the space reflects innovative contemporary design.”The development is guiding a rental income of £, for each floor.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sk_123.jpg","title":"more than  of business group members back brexit withdrawal deal","story":"Posted on Monday December  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s business community has overwhelming thrown its weight behind a withdrawal agreement on Brexit – with almost % of one major lobby group’s members in favour, it can be revealed.The CBI, Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, Federation of Small Businesses and IoD are among the groups which have backed the deal on the table. Meanwhile, farming unions in Northern Ireland and throughout the UK have also issued their support for the deal.It would essentially provide a backstop, and create a deeper customs union between Northern Ireland the EU, along with a closer alignment in the single market.Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI says that the agreement is “the only show in town.”He said a poll of its members showed .% of those who replied were in support.“This is the only show in town. The rules are clear – in order for the UK to move to the most productive discussion on what the future relationship will be, we need a withdrawal agreement. The options are the agreement, or no deal,” he told Ulster Business.“Business in Northern Ireland and agri-business have made it clear that no deal is not an option.”Other business groups backing the proposed agreement include the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI, Hospitality Ulster and the Freight Transport Association.Writing in the Belfast , Prime Minister Theresa May said Northern Ireland will thrive under the proposed Brexit deal, and its position as part of the UK “is guaranteed”.She said her agreement with Brussels “puts Northern Ireland in a fantastic position for the future”, and moved to reassure unionists that “Northern Ireland’s constitutional status as part of the United Kingdom is guaranteed.“Under this deal the future is certainly bright for Northern Ireland.”On the backstop, Ms May said three things made it “an acceptable insurance policy”.She said the transition period could be extended instead of entering the backstop, regulations would be the same across all of the UK, and Northern Ireland would not be treated dferently.Meanwhile, in a joint statement, the Ulster Farmers’ Union, NFU Scotland, NFU England and NFU Cymru, said:“The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement, while not perfect, will ensure that there are no hard barriers on the day we leave the European Union, and will allow trade in agricultural goods and UK food and drink to continue throughout the transition period largely as before. This opportunity needs to be taken.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cd_1.jpg","title":"it and the city deal","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew looks at what major IT elements Belfast and the surrounding regions could get out of a potential £bn City Deal When it was formally announced that the Government would put forward £m from the Treasury towards a finance pot worth up to £bn for six councils as part of a new City Deal, it’s obvious that IT, innovation and manufacturing technologies would be high on the list. The Belfast Region City Deal will see a series of projects and schemes taking place across, Belfast, Antrim and Newtownabbey, Mid and East Antrim, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh, and Newry, Mourne and Down. And with that, a series of major IT initiatives are being outlined, many in collaboration with Ulster University and Queen’s University, in a bid to grow and expand Northern Ireland’s credentials on a global scale. “Queen’s University Belfast and Ulster University have collaborated extensively to develop proposals for global centres of innovation excellence in key growth sectors in which world-leading expertise in our universities can be leveraged by businesses to create breakthrough technologies, products and services,” the City Deal proposal says. And it adds that a deal “requires a catalyst that will drive forward investment in research and development and help embed a culture of innovation to act as a driver for increased productivity”. The councils took their case to Westminster at the end of October, and following that, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced the Treasury’s commitment. The rest of the proposed funding will come from matched finance from Stormont, with the remaining from the councils. Andthey pull it off, they are predicting as many as , new jobs could be created. DIGITAL HEALTHCARE In a bid to further grow and develop Northern Ireland’s position on the international healthcare market, the City Deal proposes creating a branded cluster of medical device and technology companies that “through a supportive and collaborative eco system of co-location and working will build the size and value of the sector”. The centre aims to attract and develop businesses across a range of areas, especially in the areas of cardiology, diabetes, respiratory and stroke. It says that a key aspect of the proposed cluster is the partnership working with scientists and companies with the existing pilot clinical lab at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Also in the pipeline is the ‘i-Reach’ project. Led by Queen’s University, Ulster University and partners from the le and health sciences sector, those behind the City Deal say it sits within the umbrella of an “emerging health innovation NI concept which seeks to bring a unied ‘front door’ for external investment into the health and le sciences sector”. DIGITAL PARTNERSHIP It is proposing a “physical and digital environment” to allow the academic research community, tech entrepreneurs and industrial partners will come together to address key challenges in business and society through the application of the IoTand data science. Those behind it say it will support a common approach to big data sourcing and management, including early adoption of prevailing industry standards and codes of practice for secure and ethical use of data. There are also plans for a ‘global innovation institute’. The plans say it will draw together the skills of several areas of Queen’s University – which includes electronics, communications and information technology, health sciences and food security – to “anchor and support the creation of a Global Innovation Quarter in Belfast”. MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY According to those behind the City Deal, the will operate at the interface between academia and industry “accelerating new technology developments through the innovation phase and ensuring that real industrial challenges based on market need are solved through collaboration with the best university research”. Queen’s and Ulster University have developed an ‘advanced manufacturing innovation centre’ concept, that will “become the springboard for manufacturing innovation within the region”. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES Northern Ireland has already proven itself on the big and small screen, but there has been a strong move towards growing that further still. Aside from NI providing the facilities and backdrop for most of Game of Thrones, there’s also been the development of the Belfast Harbour Film Studios. Part of the City Deal plan involves boosting that position, with a ‘screen and media innovation lab’ bringing together “transformative production, studio and RD facilities”. SCIENCE PARK Elsewhere, in Mid and East Antrim, plans are under way for the transformation of the former St Patrick’s Barracks site in Ballymena into a new science park – Integrated Industrial Inspiration and Innovation Campus called iC. It’s being proposed that each council area will have some form of innovation hub, which will be directed towards business development. CONNECTIVITY Aside from specic schemes, infrastructure and connectivity improvements are part of the plans. That includes improvements in fibre-optic and mobiles broadband connectivity. It comes as mobile network EE, part of the BT Group, announced that Belfast is among six cities across the UK which have been chosen for the first phase of its G launch. “Our G trials are going well, giving us valuable insight into both the performance of the new technology and the challenges of upgrading sites with this new equipment,” Marc Allera, chief executive of BT’s consumer ision said. “We’re confident that we can bring G to the busiest parts of Belfast and the UK in .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"ni hospice the best of business and sport championing a force for good","story":"Posted on Tuesday  December  by Ulster Business The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice wants to partner with business leaders from right across the province. We speak to some of its supporters, including Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers, and why they are firmly behind the charity When Northern Ireland’s top sporting exports and business leaders are getting directly involved in a charitable cause as worthwhile as the Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice, it’s hard to ignore the work the organisation is doing on a day-to-day basis.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice was established in  and is the only dedicated palliative care service in Northern Ireland. Among those working closely with the charity are Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers, founder of Vanrath, Wayne Sullivan and Pinnacle chairman, Ken Montgomery.The organisation cares for around  infants, children and their families, each year. With annual costs of £.m, the children’s hospice depends heavily on donations from the public to keep vital services going.But in addition to that, the children’s hospice is focused on boosting and growing philanthropic relationships with Northern Ireland business leaders who want to establish long-term links and a partnership with a charity who make a positive and meaningful impact across Northern Ireland.And as a result of that, it’s Time to Care programme was created – looking at new and innovative ways to reach out for key support.Heather Weir is chief executive of the NI Hospice. “The NI Hospice costs £m to run each year, and we have to raise £.m for direct care costs every year through our fundraising efforts,” she says.“As well as relying on the local community, we rely on business support too. With the vast amount of charities out there, we have been looking at how we can align the charity with business leaders and their companies, in terms of a fresh partnership approach.“We looked at how we could make supporting a charity feel really meaningful for businesses.“As a charity we need business insights, and not just in fundraising support. Having a network of business leaders is a practical way of supporting the hospice.”Heather says, aside from helping young people with le-limiting conditions, it’s also a chance for them to help improve their companies corporate social responsibility agenda.For Co Antrim man Brendan Rodgers – who paid a visit to the organisation’s Newtownabbey base alongside Wayne Sullivan and Ken Montgomery – the connection started with a letter from the NI Hospice, back when he was manager of Liverpool.“When I met Heather and came over, it was something from a personal perspective. We are all brought up as carers in Northern Ireland, and we want to give back. But I also felt that my role and responsibility as a manager – sport touches a lot of people and I could use it in a way that would hopefully open up doors for the NI Hospice in a dferent way.“In the last number of years, it’s been a great opportunity for me to meet people like Wayne, who I have met before – like-minded people who are very driven in their professional le, but alongside that, they have a real duty of care for organisation they support.”“What you have when you support the NI Hospice is something tangible.”Wayne Sullivan, founder of Vanrath, said: “What we have come up with is a project where all donations and funding goes into a specic account that is designated solely for the use of spending on nurse salaries.“You know where the money is going and that really ticks a box from our perspective. The nurses also come out to provide presentations of what they have been doing.“But asfor this, we get to use the brand and we co-partner. This is a marketing partnership.”The Time to Care relationship with companies also includes a Business Ambassadors network, which brings leaders together across a range of events.Ken Montgomery, chairman of Pinnacle, said: “For us at Pinnacle, my interest was the corporate social aspect of it and giving back to the community. Running a successful business in the community, I think there is a big role for corporates to play.”“It was also selling it to our own employees – the people working in the company. One of the things that appealed to me was having the direct contact with a particular nurse, and you felt the direct impact of what you are doing.”The key focus is enabling businesses to fund the cost of a qualied children’s nurse for a year. That relationship then offers a company access to co-branding opportunities and its own business network.The Northern Ireland Children’s Hospice has opened two new cots this year, at a cost of £, each. And for each cot, the children’s hospice needs five paediatric nurses.And the target for the NI Hospice in the next three years is focused on achieving maximum capacity, bringing it to  cots and beds, serving over , infants and children living with a le limiting and le threatening illness. That’s an additional £.m over the next three years that’s needed.   So, what’s the key message to get Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes involved “For most top businesses, their brand will have a set of values which is important to them.” Brendan says.“The key word is alignment... you want to align yourself with those values that will drive your business, your people and your customers or beneficiaries.”This year, it has also launched its Jingle All the Way campaign. It encourages businesses, organisations, schools, clubs, churches and iniduals across Northern Ireland to get involved and fundraise through a iety of areas, including a k run, a Jingle bake-off and a Jingle Jumper Day.Time to Care is a unique offer for business leaders to support the children’s hospice and the specialist nurses who  provide vital care to infants and children with a le limiting illness across Northern Ireland.

Here Emma Deighan looks at the who, what and why of STEM initiatives in the business sector According to the most recent Skills Barometer report the biggest shortage of skills in Northern Ireland falls within the science, technology, engineering and mathssectors.The research, compiled by Ulster University for the Department for the Economyin , shows an urgency to train future generations in what are the fastest-growing areas of our economy.In its analysis the report concluded: “The subjects forecast to be predominantly under-supplied are engineering and technology, maths and computer sciences and physical and environmental sciences. It is estimated that the economy will require an additional  engineering and technology graduates and a similar number of additional maths and computer science graduates each year. Strong demand for the STEM related subjects is forecast.”It’s a concern given the growth within those business isions here. An influx of international STEM related employers have set up shop here, investing in a skillset that still needs much attention. Meanwhile our homegrown hub of STEM related employers are expanding at a phenomenal rate.Some of these investments include Lisburn-based firm Camlin’s announcement that it will create  new roles in the engineering field thanks to a £m expansion. And in earlier in the year, financial services firm, FinTrU revealed it would add a further  employees to its team across Belfast and in the North West.Then there’s the hugely successful sports device firm, STATSports, that is seeking another  staff members. And two years ago Belfast-based global aerospace and defence system manufacturer Thales’ opened up a whole new field here when in it launched a £m space propulsion facility signalling a whole new area of expertise that would open up to graduates here. With the future looking bright in terms of employment in these sectors, sirens sound when the Skills Barometer says STEM related subjects have been regularly under-supplied. It described it as a “consistent finding” across several years of research but fortunately activity to level out the supply-demand flow within the STEM world here is by no means passive. Governmental, third sector organisations and indeed those businesses reliant on that talent pool have been engaging in initiatives to support a deficit in talent. Clinical diagnostics firm Randox is one such employer. Software development, IT support, engineering, science research and mathematics make up the bulk of its operations and as such it promotes roles within the latter fields through STEM programmes.Linda Magee, head of human resources at Randox, said: “At Randox there are plenty of opportunities to work across a wide iety of STEM disciplines. Our APEX programme, which offers first year university students a complete career package, includes work experience between first and second year, a paid placement in third year and, finally, a graduate position post-degree.“Students accepted on to the Randox APEX programme work with, and learn from, the most experienced professionals in the industry, across a range of departments within their discipline.“They might be assisting our ground-breaking research into tests for cancer, kidney disease and Alzheimer’s, working in our engineering department developing diagnostic technologies, contributing to the output of a busy forensics laboratory, or joining our business development teams as they expand the Randox portfolio across the globe.”Linda said the firm also encourages “established talent” to come back and join the company through a ‘ers’ programme, a six-week scheme aimed at those who have had a break from the workplace. It includes induction, training and mentoring.“There are endless opportunities for career progression at Randox – the sky really is the limit,” she said.Another firm with training high up its agenda is FinTrU, the investment bank services firm, at the Gasworks in Belfast.In terms of recruitment, FinTrU developed its two-year Graduate Programme with a long-term commitment to providing analysts with support, training and industry qualications such as Investment Operations Certicates .It also offers financial services academies which have resulted in almost  jobs for graduates in Belfast. Named Academy X,  this year’s intake welcomed a range of graduates from non-financial backgrounds to allow them to forge a career in the sector. Founder of the company, Darragh McCarthy, believes such programmes create an “ecosystem” that gives back to the talent pool and economy here. “I see FinTrU as having a social purpose to create high-quality professional employment in Northern Ireland,” he said.One of the most active firms in nurturing a talent pool in IT is Kainos. Each year the NI digital services giant donates over £, and , man hours to safeguarding the IT sector’s future. Kainos’ technology outreach manager Gemma Crothers said: “You can go into schools and they have this tumbleweed idea thatyou’re going to work in IT you literally get a PC and type stuff. And we want to change that perception.“There are so many dferent areas to IT. And it’s lucrative and that’s the message we’re trying to put across. We are trying to change the way the schools are managed and bring computer science in at a nationwide level and we are lobbying the government for that.“One of the big areas for us is trying to train teachers on all levels so they have the confidence in the classroom to weave the skills in and give the students the exposure they need so they can chose to follow through.”Kainos recently announced that it was seeking applications for its ‘Earn as you Learn’ scheme. It’s a funded computing systems degree that also allows students to earn a salary while they study. Brendan Mooney, Kainos’ chief executive said of the scheme offers students the best of both worlds. He said: “The pace of technological change is faster than ever. So, anyone who can obtain both industry experience and an education at the same time, will have the advantage. They get to apply what they have learned in university and also get a head start in their career.“At Kainos we pride ourselves on our determination to nurture and invest in the talent of the future and are committed to broadening access and offering dferent routes to school leavers from dferent backgrounds.”In the science field, Craigavon-based global pharmaceutical company Almac Group also works closely with schools and universities to encourage interest in STEM subjects and careers.Frances Weldon, STEM outreach manager at the firm said Almac believes it has a responsibility to drive interest in the field to “grow a dynamic and innovative economy that benefits all”.“At Almac we are hugely focused on engaging with the next generation and helping them gain skills that they will need for their future careers. We rely on the talent, skills and expertise of our dedicated employees to drive continued growth and realise our vision to advance human health. We know that to ensure our success in the future we need even more skilled and knowledgeable recruits.”Among its initiatives are the Sloane McClay and Almac McKervey awards, work shadow placements, apprenticeships and industrial placements for third level students, some of which do not require a science background. “In the new year, through a partnership with W, we will launch a £m project aimed at enhancing STEM knowledge, skills and understanding among school pupils. An interactive exhibition will explore the human body and the diagnosis and treatment of illness as well as telling Almac’s story,” Frances said.The objective she says is to “inspire a new generation of students to gain skills to help them secure exciting and innovative roles such as those we offer at Almac”.The latter investments represent just a fraction of STEM activity ongoing here. The wider picture of such initiatives is not just beneficial to STEM businesses but the economy as a whole here.

Seamus Leheny is just one voice in the increasingly tumultuous debate around the main concerns and issues that still exist around the border, following the UK’s exit from the EU. We currently sit on the precipice, a Schrodinger’s cat scenario, where we on one hand have some form of early agreement on ensuring noto a hard border, and at the same time, don’t, while waiting to see whether the Prime Minister can sell it. We then establish what will be done to avoid any severe impact to cross-border trade here. The BBC’s Chris Mason garnered attention with an honest abstract on Brexit progress a couple of weeks ago - ‘I haven’t for the foggiest idea’ he told his colleagues back in the studio. “When we turn our attention to commercial goods vehicles crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, it’s a very dferent story,” Seamus Leheny says. More than . million goods vehicles crossed the border in , according to official stats. And of those . million movements, the majority was recorded on the A Belfast to Dublin road. “When we break down the figures on cross border traffic, this equates to an average of , goods vehicles crossing the border daily, which is  per hour – or to illustrate it in comparison to cross channel movements, it’s a large freight ferry fully laden every  minutes,  ,  days a year,” Seamus says. For Dale Farm for example, and other food processors, its concern is over the certication process, following Brexit. “It’s basically an export certicate for dairy products. You are not allowed to export without this certicate,” Nick says. “For example, we have signed a quite public announcement with Lidl. We are supplying Lidl all over the world. If Lidl were to ask me in the morning, can you guarantee that you can supply my countries outside the UK on April   I actually can’t. “It’s nothing to do with tarfs or costs. If I don’t have animal health export certicates approved well-ahead of Brexit – these things take about six months to negotiate. “I’m screaming at DEFRAand DAERAhere to get this done now. “Why don’t you agree the wording, and have the work done, so when the agreement is or isn’t made… now you can start. “It’s a huge risk for this industry here,we can’t get stuff off the island.” Around % of Northern Ireland’s dairy, as an example, is sold where. A study by InterTrade Ireland said a signicant share of cross-border trade is accounted for by firms that trade “simultaneously in both directions”. “These two-way traders make up around % of ﬁrms, but accounted for over % of exports and over % of imports,” according to Seamus. With transport, Translink boss Chris Conway says it remains unclearthe company will be able to run cross-border bus services,no deal on Brexit is secured. During an evidence session in Westminster, he said that the organisation runs around  cross-border services – some which, he said, “meander” between Northern Ireland and the Republic during a journey. There’s also the issue of whether drivers will be able to operate between jurisdictions following the UK’s exit. That’s due to a question mark floating over the head of licences for drivers in the EU. Elsewhere, the Road Haulage Association has said with around three months left to go it is not prepared for what’s around the corner. It’s a two-way street, of course, for both firms from Northern Ireland selling south, and those from the Republic selling north. Figures from the ONS show Northern Irish business with the Republic of Ireland accounted for around % of exports and % of imports. “The share of intermediate products in imports from Northern Ireland to Ireland is higher in almost all sectors than trade in the same sectors from the rest of the UK,” Seamus said in a piece examining the impact of a ‘no deal’ scenario. “So for example, a company could transport ingredients or components across the border several times before the finished product is completed in Northern Ireland, and is then ready for export to consumers in Great Britain. “Naturally the intermediate products will be of lesser value compared to the completed product, hence the disparity in value of goods crossing the Irish Sea compared to the land border. “In recent Brexit discussions the signicance of the value of trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain has been highlighted. “This is quite right and we must ensure this hugely important market for us is not jeopardised or impeded in any way as a result of Brexit. “What has often been overlooked is our reliance on being able to move goods quickly, cheaply and without tarfs across the Irish border, in order to assemble those valuable goods we end up shipping to Great Britain. “If the all-island supply chains are impeded with subsequent increased costs and subject to tarfs, then those exports we champion and put on those ferries to Great Britain will suddenly become less competitive in price – or, in the worst case scenario, won’t exist anymore.” Seamus says a “holistic approach is required when trade from Northern Ireland is discussed and used as a bargaining chip due to the fact it’s a unique economic region that is finely interwoven with that of another EU member state”. “To pursue, or indeed to sleep walk into, a no deal Brexit would unravel the carefully tailored economy of Northern Ireland and potentially leave it in tatters.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
