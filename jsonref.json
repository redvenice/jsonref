Photograph: Mark Stedman.An entire shop dedicated to Harry Potter wands and T-shirts, a petting zoo, a Willy Wonka Museum and a new look Trinity College facade complete with a wig and a chocolate fountain were some of the ideas conceived by children asked to re-imagine what Dublin’s College Green could look like.There was no sign of a slow moving Luas carriages, traffic jams, drunken stag parties spilling out of Temple Bar or fleets of angry taxi drivers anywhere.Instead the new Children’s Quarter designed over four days last week by young people at the Ark in Dublin’s Temple Bar was a colourful playground full of slides and zip wires and ball pits. And a sanctuary for pigeons.Ideas for what a new look College Green could be were sent in by children from across the country with the actual models made by a group of 20 who took part in an architectural camp at the children’s centre over four days last week.“I don’t know what it is about the pigeons, the kids seem to love them,” said Al Gleeson who worked with the children. He was referencing the glass-domed centre for the birds that the children thought should sit on top of a new look building on the former Ulster Bank site.“They weren’t so fond of the seagulls mind you,” he added, pointing to signs warning those birds not to be messing or acting the maggot. “I’m not sure why that would be the case.”Ark director Aideen Howard said the project sought to “put children to the fore” and to make them visible in the city centre.“That is what we are here for really. One of the things that strikes me about what the kids have designed is the absence of barriers to any of these fantastic ideas. I think too often adults immediately put obstacles in the way of any ideas they might come up with. We are always looking for the problems.”She said that children and families are generally not considered when it comes to town planning and much of the focus is on transport and commerce. How urban spaces will actually be used by people - particularly children - gets forgotten, Ms Howard said.“Another interesting thing is the number of slides that the kids have put in. That tells me that they see travel as fun and not as a chore. They have also suggested that we accommodate different forms of transport from flying to scooting and rollerblading”.Sam Gibson, who was involved in the camp, said he would like to see a new look Dublin city centre include a building made of Lego “and a Titanic Museum” while fellow camper Jessica O’Shea said if she was in charge of town planning, a stage where people could dance would be front and centre.She also called for a lot more playgrounds and art galleries “and a place for people who would like to eat lots of sweets”. She expressed the view that there are “too many pubs in the city”.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\u0027/polopoly_fs/1.3454335.1523099266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"doctors-urged-to-start-charging-for-everything-to-win-new-deal-1.3454337","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDelegates at the Irish Medical Organisation’s annaul meeting in Killarney, Co Kerry. Photograph: Shane O’Neill.Doctors should make the public unhappy by “charging for everything” in order to get the Government to engage with them on a new GP contract, Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) members have been told. The doctors’ group is holding its annual meeting in Killarney, Co Kerry and delegates have been told that general practice has become financially unviable and that the Government must urgently reverse austerity-era financial cuts. Former IMO president Dr Ken Egan said he honestly did not see a new contract for GPs being put in place in the next five years. “The only way you will get anything is to make the public unhappy,” the Mayo GP said. Dr Egan suggested that doctors should increasingly charge patients for services. He said the impetus for the government to introduce the original contract with GPs in the early 1970s was because dispensary doctors had started charging everyone a fee of £1, which drove the Department of Health to bring in changes .“We are here today and saying general practice is falling asunder. But the patients are not saying that. I do not see patients out complaining,” he said. “So in the real world it needs a lot more than us saying it. So it beholds you as a union to definitely to get into negotiations. But we are doing things cheaply . We need to start charging for everything.” IMO chief operations officer Susan Clyne said it was up to each inidual to decide on charges.The doctors present backed a motion stating that a roadmap for unwinding cuts imposed under financial emergency legislation was needed before any new services could be introduced. Minister for Health Simon Harris is expected to tell the conference later that talks on a new contract between GPs and the State will resume in the next few weeks. Doctors are angry at the Government’s stance that it will not reverse the €120 million in austerity era cuts “for nothing “ and will want them in return to take on additional services. The conference was told that general practice was facing a workforce crisis in the years ahead . Dr Michael Kelleher said there were 2,536 GPs with contracts to operate the medical card scheme. However, he said 700 of these were in their 60s and would be retiring in the next few years. Even more concerning, he said, was the collapse in the number of young doctors entering the scheme with fewer than 90 of the doctors working in it under the age of 35. He said only 380 were under 40, which he said was a frightening figure.Dr Darragh O’Neill said the current picture of the retirements was worrying but what was likely to come afterwards was frightening. Dr Liam Holmes said GPs in their 50s were closing their practices and moving abroad. Dr Tadhg Crowley said when the impending manpower crisis in general practice hit, there would be “an explosion and we will go over the cliff”.Dr John O’Brien said general practice was at a tipping point. “Speaking about Fempi cuts and talking about putting extra work into general practice as a pay off for that is delusional. If we are to make general practice survive, we need an injection of new money now with no work attached to it.”He said GPs around the country had no further capacity at all for any other work and were having great difficulty meeting the work that they were undertaking at the moment. He said 70 per cent of practices were now closed to new patients. He said this was an “absolutely outrageous figure” .Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish-news","story":"IMO urges HSE to establish separate service for care of violent or aggressive patientsEx-Sinn F\u0026eacutein chief says: \u0026lsquoThe people that I know didn\u0026rsquot go to war.

During discussions in October 2016, Mr Pitt was advised that the radio station might have a value of up to €14 million, approximately €20 million less than was being sought. The sale never went ahead.The purchase of Newstalk was promoted by the then chairman of INM, Leslie Buckley, according to an affidavit before the High Court from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Ian Drennan. Mr Buckley is a close business associate of Mr O’Brien.According to Mr Drennan’s affidavit, there was an exchange of text messages on November 11th, 2016, between Mr Buckley and Mr O’Brien about Mr Pitt’s protected disclosure.The INM board was not aware of the matter until 10 days later, on November 21st, when it established a committee to investigate. The committee met on November 22nd and November 23rd. It heard from Mr Buckley but did not invite Mr Pitt to appear before it.The affidavit goes on to say the committee came to a unanimous decision on November 23rd that there was no evidence of any matter that constituted a serious concern for INM, and decided to advise the board to take no further action.Mr Drennan, in his affidavit, described this as “wholly unsatisfactory and inadequate” and said there was a failure to appreciate the gravity of the situation. The affidavit quotes a text from INM director Len O’Hagan to Mr Buckley on November 26th where he said: “I know it’s galling for us but I believe we now need to write the cheque and be done with him.” Mr Buckley replied that he had the INM lawyers working on it.Mr O’Brien later sent a message to Mr Buckley that said: “This storm will pass. I know it is awful for you, but we need to play the long game. This will put pressure on the two malcontents... Ultimately we may have to get them out and pay them. Best regards, Denis.”After the committee’s decision, Mr Pitt threatened legal action, and an independent review was established. It did not come to a definitive finding on the disclosures because of the gulf between what was said by Mr Buckley and by senior management. Mr Pitt then made a protected disclosure to Mr Drennan. Mr O’Brien did not respond to a request for a comment. Mr Buckley has said he will “robustly defend” himself against any allegation made by Mr Drennan. A spokesman for INM had no comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\u0027/polopoly_fs/1.3453320.1523042669!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"department-collects-280-planning-documents-for-worst-case-brexit-1.3453322","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Department of Foreign Affairs has collected emergency plans from all Government departments amounting to 280 documents in preparation for the possibility of no deal being reached on Brexit. Plans were sought by the department, which is leading the Government’s preparations for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU in March 2019, as part of contingency planning for a worst-case scenario. The reports sought from the departments are aimed at preparing a Government-wide response to manage a disorderly Brexit, including any emergency legislation required and measures to deal with high tariffs imposed on goods entering and leaving the UK and delays at Irish and British ports. In some cases, the department has sought more detailed plans, resulting in dozens more documents being submitted by the Departments of Finance and Business. The Department of Finance has looked at whether new legislation would be required for financial services in the event of a hard Brexit given that contracts in this area are governed by English law.The potential number of new customs and excise staff and additional resources required by the Revenue Commissioners to manage post-Brexit inspections and Border checks has also been explored by the department.“A massive amount of work has been going on across all Government departments to ensure Ireland is prepared for every eventuality with Brexit,” said a spokesman for Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Simon Coveney, who is managing the Government’s Brexit team.“We have to be prepared for a disorderly Brexit and that work is under way, it is contingency planning we hope never to have to use,” he added.The department has declined to release details of the planning contained within the documents as it was “still being processed and is extremely sensitive” with Brexit negotiations ongoing, said the spokesman.“It is not in the national interest for us to air our contingency planning for all to see during international negotiations which are of such fundamental importance for the future of the island,” he said.EU and UK negotiators have been meeting over the quiet Easter period in Brussels discussing for the first time potential ways to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland.In a separate development, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has accepted an invitation to visit Ireland again at the end of this month. Mr Barnier is expected to visit the Border and possibly Belfast when he visits for the Government’s next all-island civic dialogue on Brexit, comprising 1,500 civic society and industry representatives, in Dundalk, Co Louth. Ahead of that visit, Mr Coveney will continue his round of shuttle Brexit diplomacy, briefing foreign ministers of smaller EU countries over the coming week on Ireland’s concerns around the UK’s departure.Portuguese foreign minister Augusto Santos Silva will visit Mr Coveney at Iveagh House in Dublin on Monday. The Tánaiste will meet the new Dutch foreign minister, Stef Blok, in The Hague on Wednesday.He will then host German foreign minister Heiko Maas in Dublin on Thursday. Ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday week Mr Coveney will host the foreign ministers of the EU’s Nordic and Baltic member states along with Mr Blok at a dinner the previous evening.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"the-agreement","story":"A central figure in Good Friday negotiations, PUP leader is on political margins, 20 years onFormer deputy leader of SDLP says deal has been damaged in some eyes, but it still has promiseTwo decades after it was signed, the agreement that underpins the peace looks vulnerableFormer US President will receive the award at a ceremony on April 10th in Ulster HallTwenty years ago, a team concluded negotiations that sealed Belfast AgreementThe 1998 accord did not end the Troubles, but it did result in extraordinary progressFormer SDLP leader says deal has been damaged but has not outlived its usefulnessDo our current leaders have the same skills as those who helped secure the Belfast Agreement?Officials in both governments acknowledge lack of chemistry between Varadkar and MayHave we seen the new beginning to policing which was promised asks Joanne Murphy?Some families have campaigned for over 40 years for truth and justiceBritish-Irish relationship is both bedrock of agreement and its driving force, writes Katy HaywardThe Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister have staked their political reputations on the comprehensive peace package agreed\u0026hellipPerhaps, in time, the date will resonate in the collective memory of our children and our grandchildren, just as 1916 or 1912\u0026hellipWe send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayInvalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\u0027/polopoly_fs/1.3454351.1523103236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"violence-can-be-a-legitimate-way-to-achieve-aims-adams-says-1.3454352","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has said he believes violence can, in certain circumstances, be justified to reach political aims. Photograph: Cyril ByrneThe Irish Times.Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams has said he believes violence can, in certain circumstances, be justified to reach political aims.In an interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel, Mr Adams was asked about the Troubles, the current political deadlock in Northern Ireland and his hopes for a united Ireland.He was speaking ahead of the 20th anniversary of the Belfast Agreement next week.When asked if he believes violence is a legitimate means with which to reach one’s aims, he replied: “I think in given circumstances. “And the circumstances at that time in the North were that people were being denied their rights. “The English occupiers refused to concede those and in fact attacked the demonstrators. The most disastrous mistake that the English government made is that they handed the situation over to the generals. That always leads to a militarisation of the situation. Military people are not there to pacify, they are there to subjugate.” Mr Adams denied ever shooting at anyone during the Troubles but said he joined Sinn Féin after reading what the British government had planned for Ireland in the Special Powers Act.“The people that I know didn’t go to war. The war came to us,” he said.“I woke up one morning, and the British Army were in occupation of the local school, the local football pitch, the local social centre, the roadblocks were up. They were stopping you. They were throwing you up against the wall. They were arresting you. They were molesting women, and so on and so on.”Mr Adams was asked how he reconciled his Catholic faith with the use of violence. “It’s still my view that the use of armed actions in the given circumstances is a legitimate response. Whether you exercise that right is another issue. And of course, there were many things that the IRA did which were wrong. And I both condemned at the time and deplore and regret it to this time,” he said.Mr Adams was also asked if the Belfast Agreement was worth the deaths of more than 3,000 people killed during the Troubles.“Well, it’s hard to measure it in those ways. Of course, it would’ve been far better if not one person was killed or injured. But you don’t pursue and you don’t get progress without struggle,” he said.“And I say that as someone who has lost a lot of family members and friends and who has been tortured and shot myself. I’ve been there, and I’ve been at many, many funerals. But of course, you can only measure all of this at the end of all of this. And I do believe that Irish unity is going to be the reality.“Many armed groups were involved in the conflict. Regardless of who was responsible, I regret all the dead. Our cause and our commitment must be to ensure it never happens again.”Mr Adams said he felt he achieved his aims as leader of Sinn Féin and would continue to work as an activist. He was replaced by Mary Lou McDonald in February and intends to retire from the Dáil following the next general election.
