She proved her countryside credentials by milking one of the cows on the set — this won her a bet with Lionel Barrymore.In another scene she breaks a window by throwing a rock through it. Capra had employed a marksman to shoot the glass out, but Reed achieved the feat unaided.Ginger Rogers turned down the role of Mary, saying she thought the character was boring — something she lived to regret.DRUNKEN STUPORThe child actor Bobby Anderson played George Bailey as a boy in a flashback scene in which he is slapped by Bedford Falls’ drunken chemist, Mr Gower.Anderson said later that the actor in the role, H.B.

Indeed, my claim to be the Fifth Johnson was enhanced by the fact that my hair was blond and even messier than Boris’s. In fact, part of me wonders if I inspired his trademark unkempt look.Looking back at that garden photo with the benefit of hindsight, it can be seen as a symbol of what Classics-quoting Boris might call his modus operandi.During one university summer vacation, I recall Boris’s father, Stanley, arranging for Boris and Rachel to investigate ‘animal atrocities’ in Spain and Portugal for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. Allegra and I were WAGS who went along for the ride.After a week attending bull fights and monitoring the cruel tradition of photographing captive animals on beaches, Allegra left us to return home and we continued on our way.         Partying again in 2008: Boris and Sebastian at a bash held for the 180th anniversary of The SpectatorEach night for a week, Boris would sit me down, man-to-man and ask me over tapas whether he should marry Allegra. He was clearly in a state of mental anguish.By telling him they were far too young and that he should hold his horses, I felt like a Cassandra figure prophesying doom.Most of his other male friends also cautioned him against a precipitate marriage.Imagine my mortification when I later discovered that Boris had already secretly proposed to Allegra before our trip abroad.He had not been confronting the agony of indecision, as I thought at the time, but the agony of having already embarked on a course of action from which he felt there was no way back.There is a clear pattern of behaviour here: suffering mental anguish over difficult decisions and devising uniquely Boris strategies to wriggle through.For example, the way he weighed up both sides of the question of marriage was similar to what he did three decades later when he prepared two drafts of his weekly Daily Telegraph column — one in favour of Brexit, the other for Remain — before deciding which one he would use.Ever the intellectual, he explained that such bizarre behaviour (which critics said proved he had no principles) helped make his mind up.Another case in point was his attempt to become president of the Oxford Union debating society. Although not as Left-wing as the student body at his college, Balliol, it was inconceivable for a Tory such as Boris to be elected president.Balliol’s then Master, Anthony Kenny, later remembered: ‘Boris concealed his Conservative affiliation and let it be widely understood that he was a Social Democrat. So far as I know, he told no actual lies, but his strategy recalled Thomas Macaulay’s words about the difference between lying and deceiving: “Metternich told lies all the time, and never deceived any one Talleyrand never told a lie and deceived the whole world.”’         I became the Fifth Johnson — in a similar way that the ‘Fifth Beatle’ is an informal title applied to any number of musicians who were at one point a member of The Beatles He said, in reference to the Austrian and French diplomats during the Napoleonic era that with ‘Talleyrand-like skill’, Boris was duly elected president of the Oxford Union.Kenny went on to say that he was subsequently contacted by an MP for the then Social Democratic Party who was looking for an intern to work for him.‘I’ve just the man for you,’ Kenny told him. ‘Bright and witty and with suitable political views. He’s just finished being president of the Union, and his name is Boris Johnson.’When Kenny summoned Boris to ask whether he was interested in the job, Boris burst out laughing: ‘Master, don’t you know I am a dyed-in-the-wool Tory?’Pure Boris!Whenever I see him at London parties these days, we reminisce in mock reverie about our Oxford University days together before he always mutters under his breath the words: ‘Omerta, omerta.’This is a reference to the code of silence practised by the mafia (and a refusal to give evidence to police about illegal activities). Boris says it half in jest, but also half in earnest.         Boris Johnson holds up a bagged smoked fish during his speech during a Conservative leadership hustingsHe expects loyalty from his closest friends (of whom there are very few) and the unspoken understanding is that their loyalty will be reciprocated.In the infamous secret tape-recording of a conversation between Boris and his Old Etonian friend turned jewel thief Darius Guppy in 1990, Guppy pledges his ‘love’ to Johnson after he agreed to help him track down and beat up a tabloid journalist who was on Guppy’s trail.(Incidentally, I once recall him thumping his sister during a heated discussion about who was the lead singer of The Clash. Rachel had insisted it was Paul Simonon. Boris rightly named Joe Strummer.)Boris later dismissed the conversation with Guppy as a joke.But for him, friendship is no laughing matter.When I went to study at Oxford University in 1984, Boris had been there a year and had already made his mark.He was fully formed, unlike so many other juvenile undergraduates, and was talked of as a future statesman. He was super-clever (with Balliol having given him a scholarship funded by a bequest dating back to the 19th century from the philanthropist Hannah Brackenbury), could recite Shakespeare sonnets on the hoof as he strode down Oxford’s streets and had bagged Allegra, the most beautiful girl in his year. At the time, she was a Conde Nast magazine cover girl.At the Oxford Union, he was justly renowned for his oratory and seemingly off-the-cuff jokes. Of course, we all suspected they were well-rehearsed but they were no less funny.He sprinkled his speeches with Latin and Greek references — many of which went way over our heads. Of course, he was a member of the Bullingdon Club, the notorious and elitist dining society which generally invited only Old Etonians to join.He was present during one of its meetings in Oxford when a pot plant was thrown through a restaurant window and some members ended up in police cells.Many years later, Boris, who was among those arrested, recalled: ‘The party ended up with a number of us crawling on all fours through the hedges of the botanical gardens, and trying to escape police dogs. And once we were in the cells, we became pathetic namby-pambies.’In fact, the Boris I knew was not the Bullingdon Boris nor the Oxford Union Boris — it was not Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson at all.He was known by his family and friends simply as ‘Al’, an abbreviation of his first name. Boris nicknamed me Bossman Von Sebsies (don’t ask me why).We holidayed together. We romanced together (with our respective girlfriends). We played what he calls whiff-whaff (the game invented on the dining tables of Victorian England and which most of us know as table-tennis) and enjoyed our gilded youth.Al was warm, affable, tremendous company, sensitive and artistic.This was a talent inherited from his brilliant artist mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, who always insisted her eldest son was a softie who could be more easily hurt than Rachel. That was her version of Al, which didn’t quite square with the public Boris.Sometimes the two sides of his character seemed to be in tension.Boris loved playing to the gallery, was ever restless, competitive and had a hunger to succeed.         Boris Johnson speaks at a Conservative Party leadership campaign hustings at the Excel Centre in LondonRachel recalls he once broke one of his toes by kicking the table in a temper over losing a table tennis point to her. He once played me at squash and obliterated me over five games. The score? 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. 9-0. I privately thought: ‘Come on, you bastard, surely you can give me one point! Instead, I meekly said: “Well done, Al.”’To understand the Boris phenomenon, you have to look at his parents’ disastrous marriage.Critics say Boris Johnson loves only himself, whereas the truth is that he is always seeking love and approval.The Johnson sibling rivalry is well known. For example, Rachel once said to Boris: ‘Have you heard the bad news about Jo? He got a First.’And when Boris was at university, he felt he was in competition with his own father.Stanley had been another early achiever who met his future wife when both were Oxford undergraduates. (Charlotte gave birth to Boris when she was 22 before she had graduated and Stanley won the Newdigate poetry prize.)Boris’s father later orced Charlotte, and her prolonged absences in hospital with depression meant all the children were frequently left to their own devices.Self-sufficiency became an imperative.Boris, it seemed, was determined to match, if not eclipse, Stanley’s matrimonial, procreative and academic achievements.Stanley certainly put me through my paces.When once visiting his family farm, Nethercote in Exmoor, he proposed a walk one morning and suggested we exchange Wellington boots.I thought this was some quaint West Country ritual I was unfamiliar with, or maybe a throwback Turkish custom in honour of his Eastern roots.I happily obliged.Only half an hour into our walk did the purpose of his gesture become apparent.Both my feet were waterlogged. One of Stanley’s boots had holes in it. He cackled with laughter and found it all tremendously funny. Another episode became famous in the Johnson family annals and was referred to ever after as ‘the Rape of the Jacket’.Boris, Jo, Leo, Allegra and myself were seated at table for lunch. I was in the habit of wearing a jacket, even in hot weather.Calmly, Stanley repeatedly asked me to take it off, saying: ‘It’s fairly warm in here.’But then he erupted: ‘Right, that’s it. I can’t take it any more.’Before I knew it, he had got up from his seat, marched around the table to my chair, stood behind me and yanked the jacket off me.The whole family sniggered with laughter. Heartless or too hearty? I could never decide.For all the talk of Boris’s Turkish ancestry, he was born in New York, educated at Eton College and was brought up in the heartland of the privileged, metropolitan elite.His godmother was Lady Rachel Billington, novelist daughter of the prison reform campaigner Earl of Longford. And dinner chez Charlotte in Elgin Crescent, Notting Hill, was always a stimulating affair that resembled the talking shop of the British Establishment.One night we would be joined by Anthony Howard, the then deputy editor of The Observer. Another night it would be Simon Jenkins, the future Times editor.Boris always held his own in such company. But then again his maternal grandfather was a Fellow of All Souls in Oxford and reputedly one of the cleverest men in England. That key human value for Boris — loyalty — emerged once more.For example, when Anthony Howard cast aspersions on our university contemporary Toby Young, Boris loyally rose to his defence.Other principles were firmly held.I remember one conversation he had with his maternal grandmother on the Isle of Skye. She asked Boris if he believed in free will. (Such weighty issues were what passed for small talk in the Johnson household.)‘I think I believe in the sensation of free will,’ said Boris. In other words, he believed in fate.The truth is that Boris has always had a sense of his own destiny and this matched his childhood vow to become world leader.Other values are also non-negotiable.Much has been written about Boris’s chaotic organisational skills.His stag night was a classic example. One Sunday, a week before the wedding in September 1987, he belatedly realised that he hadn’t organised one.So we set off that night on an impromptu outing.We chose to visit the drinking dens of Soho — believe me, it was much seedier then than it is now.There were four of us — the groom, myself, his brother, Jo, and an Eton friend.Wild horses wouldn’t drag from me the truth of what went on that night. (‘Omerta, omerta,’ I hear Boris say.) You’ll have to wait for Boris’s memoirs to find out.Suffice to say it was a spectacular farce commensurate with what happened a week later at the wedding when he had to borrow a pair of trousers from a guest and lost his ring at the reception.One of Johnson’s predecessors as a scholar at Balliol was Aldous Huxley, author of that great dystopian novel Brave New World. How apt that next Tuesday, Boris Johnson could be ushering in his own brave new world for this country.Yes, I always believed he was destined for high office but not even my old Oxford self would have dared to believe that Britain’s future would one day lie in this infuriatingly paradoxical man’s hands."},{"url":null,"title":"Smallest school Britain set close soon ONE pupil left","story":"Share this article Associate head teacher David Fann called the decision ‘very sad’ and said the school – which is due to close on Tuesday – was ‘the core of the community’. He also said that the seven members of staff were shocked and numb, adding: ‘It will hit them hard.

This figure may only increase by a few pupils over the coming years, so there really is no other option.

My dad was a TV engineer so thankfully they had a TV to watch the space race on. Two days after I was born, my sister asked if she could name me after the first men on the moon. Neil was her first choice but that was a little posh – we were a common-as-muck family – so they went for Aldrin Armstrong.The mission saw Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin leave in the Apollo Lunar Module to make the first crewed landing on its surface.

Later that evening, PNG police visited his hotel room to tell him he was being deported from the country.“I just walked up the public road to the East Lorengau transit centre and just politely asked to go in,” he said. “The immigration guy at the gates asked for my passport, I gave it to him. He said ‘Ok you can go now, but I’m keeping your passport’. So I said I wasn’t going anywhere until I got my passport back.“He did give me my passport back. We left. Five or 10 minutes later we were just walking down the main road in Lorengau and got bailed up by four heavily armed police officers and instructed to get in the vehicle.“They said: ‘We are deporting you’. I said I think you will need to make it more official than that. Later that night they came and instructed me to leave Manus and PNG.”McKim told reporters in Hobart on his return on Saturday that things were “worse than it has ever been” on the island.“And that’s because they’ve lost hope for the future,” he said.He said the prime minister, Scott Morrison, could “simply agree with Jacinda Ardern” – who visited Australia on Thursday – that the refugees should be resettled in New Zealand.“Ms Ardern has made it abundantly clear that her offer remains … He could bring an end to six years of human misery.”On Friday, PNG’s chief migration officer, Solomon Kantha, said McKim “failed to request access to the centre through the appropriate channels” and lacked “appropriate authorisation”.McKim said this statement was “riddled with inaccuracies”.“They said I demanded to enter, I made no such demands. I simply stood on a public street and asked politely.“They said I hadn’t gone through proper channels. Well I actually emailed their chief migration officer a few days ago, and formally asked permission to enter and never heard back.“But the issue is not me, the issue is these guys have been imprisoned illegally for so many years and treated so badly.

A lover’s moon, a poet’s moon, a painted moon, made of green cheese, home to the Man in the Moon, visible above the lights of Moscow and Manhattan, Tokyo and London. Hanging as the silent  of rivers and woods. Symbol of the mystery of the universe.None of this has changed since Apollo 11 landed on that broken silent surface 50 years ago. The moon is just as familiar and just as remote. The mythical and magical moon, the lunatic moon that drives men mad, Earth’s moon, lifting tides and raising sap.Ted Hughes’s poem “Full Moon and Little Frieda” is one of my favourite moon poems – everyone knows the moment of amazement and delight when we see the moon rise. I live in the countryside, and go to watch the moon come up over the wood behind my house. I know what it is, and why it is, but still it moves me and calms me.Alice Oswald’s A Sleepwalk on the Severn is perfect in its mooniness. The moon in this poem is changeable – even to herself – and dreamy as she wanders asleep among the mudflats. She is Shakespeare’s inconstant moon that lights the lovers on the balcony in Romeo and Juliet. This is the moon as part of our nightly imagination.Poets have always loved the moon, and it was Sappho who first called the moon silver. The moon is Earth’s satellite – which is why she can’t be a planet, and as she doesn’t generate her own light, she isn’t a star. But there is nothing passive about her. She stops the Earth wobbling too much as we spin. It’s called obliquity. The moon steadies us. Literally. And if you plant your vegetables using a moon calendar (yes I do) the results are surprising.Earth and the moon work as a pair an Earth-moon system. If you were standing on Mars, it would look as though they were twins, side by side, one blue, one white. This cosmic closeness was picked up by Italo Calvino in his wonderful story “The Distance of the Moon”. He imagines a time when Earth and moon were so close that their inhabitants had relationships with one another, until gradually distance began to separate us, and now we gaze forlornly at our far-away loves.There is some science behind this beautiful sad idea – it may be that the moon is a huge chunk of Earth that broke off, as the space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock explains in The Sky at Night: The Book of the Moon. It’s a book for children and adults alike, the kind of thing that makes you marvel about both our solar system and our nearest neighbour.Ronald Hutton tells a different story in his history of modern pagan witchcraft, The Triumph of the Moon. This is the moon of women, wild things, the night, the triple goddess. It is a scholarly book, and fascinating if you seek to understand the moon as magical, as symbolic, as more than a satellite in space, as a living emblem in the vast space of our imaginations.And everyone everywhere should read HG Wells’s The First Men in the Moon and Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon. Take them on holiday this summer of the moon.• Jeanette Winterson’s Frankissstein is published by Jonathan Cape.

I can’t believe it. My husband told me this morning that Waitrose was closing some stores but I was sure our store would be safe because it is always busy and the staff are lovely.”The 64-year-old likes the German chain too, but she prefers Waitrose with its wine selection and upmarket product range. “They sell duck eggs which I don’t think you can get in Lidl.”A survey once claimed that the arrival of a branch of Waitrose in a neighbourhood, with its upmarket organic food brand Duchy and Heston Blumenthal range, could add nearly £40,000 to the value of homes. But the retailer, which is part of the employee-owned John Lewis Partnership, is now in retreat, selling off or closing unprofitable shops as it adjusts to an intensely competitive grocery market where low-priced rivals are on the up.There is clear evidence that snobbery associated with where people shop is a thing of the past in Britain as shoppers seek out the best quality at the best prices. Aldi and Lidl are the fastest-growing supermarket chains in the UK as some of their larger mainstream rivals are questioning their business models.Sainsbury’s and Asda – the UK’s second- and third-largest supermarkets – recently tried to merge in an attempt to strengthen their hand against the discounters but the competition watchdog blocked the deal.Even though she has an emotional attachment to the store, Kylie Day thinks Lidl will be a better option for local people struggling to get by on low incomes.She says the Waitrose store suffered from a “lack of custom” even though there is little competition in the vicinity. “I’ll be sad to see it go as I’ve got memories of coming here with my nan …but I think Lidl will get more shoppers because of the prices,” she says. “I think the older generation have moved on and there is nobody here to spend money: younger people haven’t got it.”Aldi and Lidl are now bigger than Waitrose, which is only the eighth biggest chain in the UK with 344 stores. The two discounters ring up one in every seven pounds spent on groceries in the UK.After making inroads during the last recession the German chains have gone on to transform the way Britain shops. Last Christmas – a time when Britons traditionally take their custom to more upmarket stores such as Waitrose – two-thirds of UK households visited Aldi and Lidl, handing them their biggest ever slice of festive spending.Waitrose says the decision to close seven supermarkets, with three – Bromley, Oadby in Leicestershire and Wollaton in Nottinghamshire – being sold to Lidl, is not a sign it is throwing in the towel. It is ploughing cash into its online grocery service as it prepares to end  its long-term distribution deal with Ocado next year. It says it will compete with bigger rivals by making its stores more exciting places to shop, with the addition of sushi counters and wine bars, rather than trying to become bigger.Lidl, the smaller of the two German chains with 760 stores around the country, said last month it would invest more than £500m opening new shops in London. It is also building a new headquarters in Tolworth in south-west London to house 800 staff.Putting his Waitrose shopping bags on the boot of his car, Peter Dowse has not heard that the name on the door is going to change but says his main reason for using the store has been convenience. “I’d prefer it if they kept it as a Waitrose but I will probably keep shopping here,” he says, adding: “If it goes too downmarket I might think otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/274c750e1e8ceaa1097211ee9f55e6bf105ca1bf/258_570_5304_3182/master/5304.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9485b83c5899c15e54b67ee739bc4dae","title":"an oasis for women inside saudi arabias vast new female only workspaces","story":"The kingdom has long been a man’s world, where women have the legal status of children. Do the latest reforms represent progress – or a PR exercise?At the Luna food factory on the south-east outskirts of Jeddah, Mashael Elghamdi sits at her computer in an artfully ripped ACDC T-shirt and jeans. The faint whirr of machines processing cans of beans, cream and evaporated milk can be heard over the sound of eight women typing and sometimes laughing. A screensaver of a smiling Cameron Diaz gazes out from one corner of the room. This is an all-female office. And because there is no need for the full-length abayas women are legally required to wear when interacting with men at work or in public, it is a riot of colour.On the factory floor below, women in custom-made overalls on an all-female production line apply labels to cans. “All the women you see here do everything themselves,” says supervisor Fatima Albasisi, who oversees 90 workers. A staircase and a corridor separate the female factory workers from their male counterparts, while the men-only offices are in a different building. “If there’s a problem with the machines, they can fix it,” Albasisi adds. “If I could, I’d have a factory entirely run by women, no men at all. In my experience, women show up to work on time and make fewer mistakes.”The Luna food factory has been segregated since women began working as administrators here eight years ago. On the factory floor, the first 40 women started in 2013. “We work harder than the men,” Elghamdi tells me, back in the office. “For me, it’s better to be separate. If we work with the men, I have to wear my abaya and my niqab – it’s less comfortable.” She works in data entry, but also oversees worker safety for women. “It’s easier for them to tell me what they need,” she says. “It’s hard to go to the men.”Not all offices or factories in Saudi Arabia are gender-segregated it hasn’t been a legal requirement since 2005. But many employers continue to separate the sexes, to balance the conservative values of a majority-male workforce with the country’s apparent desire to get more women into work. As the physical barriers come down in other social settings, women-only workspaces are a symbol of both the future and the past the question of whether they are a necessary step towards full female participation remains a murky one.Saudi law specifies that women may work only in “fields suitable to their nature” and prohibits them from jobs considered “detrimental to health” or “likely to expose women to specific risks”. In practice, these opaque rules are often interpreted by employers as a means of banning women from anything physically challenging. (At the Luna factory, tasks such as moving heavy boxes are restricted to the men’s section.) A Women in the Workplace initiative, launched in January, requires that women be given separate spaces to work if they ask for them prevents women from being left alone with male colleagues and mandates that women can work as cleaners or in room service only at all-female hotels or resorts.If Saudi officials are to be believed, greater reforms are on the horizon. Recent changes – such as repealing a ban on women driving – are intended to signify the kingdom’s readiness to modernise. A 2016 directive also cut the power of the religious police, the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, who once watched over women’s behaviour in public: they are now unable to arrest women for crimes such as mixing with men who are not family members, or to berate them for showing their bare hands. The contrasts can be jarring: a Nicki Minaj concert originally scheduled for this month in Jeddah drew the ire of Saudi women, angry at Minaj being able to perform – “to go and shake her ass… and then you tell me to go and wear the abaya”, one Saudi woman said in a video posted to Twitter, viewed more than 37,000 times. Minaj has since cancelled her appearance, citing her support “for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression”.For Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir to the throne and de facto ruler, known as MBS, women’s participation is the embodiment of a new Saudi Arabia. The murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, and the subsequent cover-up, may have combusted much of the kingdom’s carefully crafted image on the international stage. But MBS remains powerful, despite the CIA’s assessment that he personally ordered Khashoggi’s killing. His mantra of change filters down from on high everyone I speak to, from street vendors to government officials, tells me, “Things are different now.” They may not always be speaking freely – a female minder accompanies me on official appointments.Long before Khashoggi’s murder, there were brutal efforts to silence critics or anyone pushing for deeper reforms. According to Amnesty International, 104 people have been executed this year. The kingdom has conducted “an unprecedented crackdown on the women’s rights movement”, Human Rights Watch says – last year arresting and prosecuting 11 women who pushed for the right to drive before it was legal, or simply spoke out against laws restricting women. According to human rights groups and their families, the women were subjected to brutal torture, including waterboarding and electric shocks. Seven have been bailed this year all await sentencing for “coordinated activity to undermine the security, stability and social peace of the kingdom”.Against this background, women-only spaces are a powerful visual signifier of change, positioning women as symbols of the new Saudi Arabia. But what do they mean to the women themselves, caught between the state’s promises and their own daily struggles to navigate a conservative society?An hour north of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast, diggers churn the sandy earth on a flat, barren plain beneath an unforgiving midday sun. There is little more to see than the sparkling turquoise-tinted glass of an empty administrative office, but the site is touted as the future of female employment in the kingdom, an “oasis” designed for women. The complex will include 48 factories producing medical supplies, food and technology.By the time construction had begun near the more progressive city of Jeddah, the government rhetoric around women’s rights and “privacy” had shifted. The Jeddah “oasis” will be “an environment that will encourage women to work”, but one where men will also be permitted, says Bandar Al-Toaimi, Modon’s communications director, gesturing at the open space as we tour the site. He says any decisions about features that could attract female workers, such as segregation, are “up to the ministry of labour’s rules and regulations”. Have any women been consulted about the design? Toaimi says he will check with the project department, but does not respond to follow-up emails. After months of detailed negotiations about my visit, I expected to see a 5 million sq m site, the foundation of a metropolis. But the complex is little more than a network of roads connecting piles of sand.Toaimi argues that the industrial park will be “a big enabler in the recruitment of females in Saudi Arabia”, as our four-wheel drive speeds along freshly built roads. Like al-Ahsa oasis, the Jeddah complex will feature a nursery and, potentially, a bus to help women get to work – though Toaimi adds dismissively that “transportation now is not an issue – women can drive”. Exactly how many isn’t clear: I fail to spot any female drivers in Riyadh or Jeddah when I visit, although a few women tell me they have obtained their licences and are cautiously starting to drive. In the months that follow, Saudi women say driving is starting to become the norm.Toaimi is upbeat about international investment but light on the details as he points out a cluster of shuttered grey factories around empty parking spaces. “We will give incentives to encourage investors to come – and ensure they have a good number of women working there. Maybe even a full facility,” he says.The global trend for women-only spaces such as the US co-working startup the Wing, which recently expanded to London, women-only train carriages in Japan and a networking retreat in Finland might sometimes create a sense that the world is catching up with Saudi Arabia. But while gender-segregated offices proliferate there, few can claim to be founded by women for women. In the offices of SheWorks, Riyadh’s sole women-only co-working space, women work on business plans from hot pink office chairs, or perch on mauve sofas, bright against the dusty cityscape outside. If men visit for meetings or training sessions, they enter via a separate door to one of the walled-off meeting rooms behind frosted windows. The office sits atop a nursery, where women can leave their children while they work. “I picked this building specifically because there is daycare downstairs,” says founder Maha Shirah, who opened SheWorks in late 2014.“There’s sort of a club vibe to it,” Shirah says of the space, looking at a nearby group clustered round a laptop. She adds that SheWorks hinges on the professional networks women build there, choosing to segregate themselves rather than being told to. “I decided to make this a women-only space because my customers wanted that,” she says, adding that she would change it if they wanted to admit men. SheWorks offers a relaxed environment where women can remove their abayas.Shirah scoffs at the promises of privacy or protection that often accompany gender-segregated workplaces. “I don’t want privacy to be forced on me,” she says. “It’s just like when you force me not to drive. No, I want to have the option. And this is what all women want in the world.”But women creating spaces to suit their own needs depends on increasing the number of female architects, a challenge in a country where women were prevented from studying the subject for decades, until 2011. Even now, “a lot of women graduating in architecture or interior design don’t have jobs,” says Haifa Al-Hababi, assistant professor of architecture at Prince Sultan University in Riyadh. Al-Hababi estimates that up to 15 women have government architecture positions, which she hopes will help increase wages and participation across the industry. She is positive about the knock-on effects of the recent reforms. “Before, you couldn’t spot any women walking along the street,” she says. “If you saw this, you’d have thought you were dreaming. Now, you see a lot of women using public space.”Gender segregation took hold in Saudi Arabia as part of a wave of conservatism that spread across the Middle East in the 80s, after Iran’s Islamic revolution. For many, separation begins at a young age: all public schools are single sex, as are many universities, some of which beam lectures given by male professors into halls of female students by video link, or keep female students apart from their male peers on a mezzanine floor.Saudi women are still legally classified as minors for their entire lives, under ship system that entitles their husband or male relative to make decisions about matters such as travel on their behalf. Recent reforms mean women no longer need a ’s permission to start a business or open a bank account. In public places, the partitions that separate “families” from “singles” (meaning men) are slowly going out of style. But decades of tradition are not easily swept away. This remains one of the most segregated societies in the world, with strict norms on gender conformity. The law bans men from “behaving like women” and it is illegal to wear the clothes of the opposite sex. At Kore gym in Riyadh, designed by a female architect and entirely operated by women since it opened last year, women train on fearsome-looking machines or crawl on the floor with bands across their legs as part of the “workout of the day”. In one corner, 18-year-old weightlifter Shirah Abdullah gulps water and chats with a friend between reps of lifting 200lb barbells. Asked what draws her to the space, she grins and says: “The community – it’s amazing here.”Kore is one of a growing number of gyms for women made possible by a change in licensing laws – a rebuke to an earlier crackdown enacted by clerics who claimed that gyms would encourage women to leave their families. The owners of Kore say several new branches are planned. But this is not without risk the Saudi General Sports Authority closed one such gym this year, claiming that a video on social media showing a woman exercising in tight sportswear was “promoting the gym disgracefully and breaching the kingdom’s code of conduct”.The women-only basement of the Panorama mall in Riyadh stands deserted, with unlit window displays of pale lace ballgowns and wedding dresses in an empty space tinted soft pink by neon lights. The ministry of labour has identified retail as a target sector for increased female employment, but this part of the mall will soon make way for a cinema, another symbol of the new Saudi Arabia. The upstairs mall – now mixed gender – will remain.Some women will miss segregation. Shop assistant Hanadi Faraj, rearranging gowns inside a friend’s boutique, tells me, “I don’t like working around men – I feel shy.” At the mall’s entrance, women wait for taxis next to a large mural merging MBS’s face with that of his father, King Salman. “I prefer women only,” says Yara Alfantoukh, a customer waiting outside with her mother. “It means I have more freedom.”Other young women prefer to navigate the challenges of gender integration. “The problem is, a lot of people have never been in a mixed environment,” says physics student Nouf Jaber, 22, who is reading a Haruki Murakami novel on the grass outside a public library in Riyadh. She points out that Saudi Arabia introduced a new anti-harassment law in May, but women still have to battle a conservative culture to report problems. “It’s one thing at work, where there’s more respect – it’s another thing for people on the street,” Jaber says. “On the street, people aren’t afraid for their jobs.” Yet she is hopeful of a future without public segregation. “I don’t feel we should be separated in restaurants or malls – that’s what caused this problem in the first place,” she says. “Suddenly they removed the barriers and no one knows what to do – I met guys who were so nervous around women that they couldn’t speak.”Jaber is considering job options for when she graduates, and recently visited the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, where she saw no women in the building. “They told me they are starting to initiate female employment,” she says. “But it’s all just talk.”One thing is certain: while the world of women’s work is evolving, public spaces are still dominated by men. As I leave a restaurant in Riyadh one evening, a large four-wheel drive pulls up next to me. “You must wear the hijab – cover your hair! Cover your hair!” a man roars, his voice filled with rage. The logo of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice is emblazoned on the car door. The officer looks over again in disgust, and drives away.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4844ef9c33fb0a90c9279d6af4c34a877f6351/741_828_4897_2939/master/4897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f151201598cf33bd1406845c2ef666be","title":"tell us about your favourite canal boat shop","story":"There are more licensed boats using Britain’s canals than at the height of the industrial revolution – and barge-based businesses are booming too.

A Social Mobility Commission study, from the University of Bath, reports that children aged 10-15 from low-income families are three times less likely than wealthier peers to engage in out-of-school musical activities, such as learning an instrument or joining a choir or orchestra.Disadvantaged children are also more likely to miss out on extracurricular sports (football, boxing, cricket) and drama, dance and art. The commission set out recommendations, including bursaries, better funding and support for schools – let’s hope they’re taken on board. As well as the activities themselves, children are missing out on other crucial gains including confidence-building, team spirit and social skill, and are less likely to go on to higher education. As certain “creative” subjects don’t qualify for the English Baccalaureate (Ebacc) school performance measure, they may already be underfunded within cash-strapped schools, so some children are missing out even more.Extracurricular activities tend to cost money, but there are also problems with a lack of availability and access, such as schools being unable to afford to run after-school clubs or stay open during holidays. Another barrier is the kids’ “fear of not fitting in”. In this sense, certain children are self-excluding from, say, learning an instrument, singing in a choir, playing cricket or acting. They decide by themselves that they’re “undeserving” of swaths of music, sport, art and drama. Unbelievably, in 2019, children as young as 10 are already hard-wired with the self-limiting poverty notion of “not for the likes of us”.This is heartbreaking. It’s hardly news that life is tougher for poorer children, but it’s an outrage if all sense of curiosity, artistry and playfulness is knocked out of them so early. Something is wrong if better-off children feel entitled to explore and participate in areas that interest and excite them, while the disadvantaged are cast from the start as cultural wallflowers – doomed to sit out every dance. The result is full-blown structural elitism: one set of kids grows and thrives, the other is erted on to a culturally sterile treadmill they could stay on for life.This isn’t about every child learning the piano or violin (but why not?), it’s about sowing the seeds for a cultural hinterland that will sustain and enrich them for life. It’s about people exploring their passions and refusing to have their horizons artificially limited – avoiding a life stripped back to the pallid basics, memorably encapsulated by the Godfathers’ song, Birth, School, Work, Death. Regardless of circumstances, all children should know that their faces “fit” – automatically and forever. Culture belongs to everyone.Would women deny themselves pornography if they liked it? A study from the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Germany found that women are just as turned on by sexual images as men, challenging the orthodoxy that men are “visual creatures” and that this explains why they’re keener on porn. While questions remained, brain scans found few differences between men and women, leading to speculation that social factors were at play – such as female sexuality being taboo and women suppressing their true feelings because enjoying porn would feel wrong and exploitative.Presumably the scientists factored in that women tend to see far less porn, and could have reacted to the novelty of the images. However, why would women suppress a liking for porn? If it’s about moral qualms – and who wouldn’t have those about an industry that systemically exploits and abuses human beings? – or even boredom with heterosexual porn’s relentless male-centric tone, surely women would be consuming “ethical porn” in greater numbers?It’s as though some men love porn so much, they can’t fathom that women are disgusted by it, or, more likely, simply aren’t interested, and prefer their own imaginations and sexual partners. That most women would just prefer to have sex than watch strangers have sex. Maybe that’s why the old PlaygirlCosmopolitan male centrefolds were generally played for giggles – the actor Burt Reynolds smirking on a bearskin – rather than any sense of genuine erotica.There’ll always be exceptions (women who love porn men who hate it), but it seems a little patronising to suggest that modern women are intimidated by their sexuality or cowed by society’s judgment. When women want things, they tend to go for it – or are we denying the concept of females as avid consumers now? The female brain isn’t scared of porn, though it could be beyond it.Who will write me the country song – The Ballad of Nick Clegg, Sockless in Silicon Valley? The former Liberal Democrat leader has spoken about his second career with Facebook as vice-president (global affairs, communications, thingy, thingy). He says he’s a misfit, that people don’t wear socks (neither does he now), and some phrases (such as “teaching grandmas to suck eggs”) are met with bewildered silence.Some might say, whatever, Clegg took the social media dollar, and there was all that unpleasantness when he said Russian activity on Facebook had nothing to do with the Brexit result (ahem). Some of us are softer hearted and can’t bear to think of Clegg taking meetings, sinking deeper into a candy-coloured beanbag, or “hanging” with twentysomething coders, ordered by Mark Zuckerberg to play Subbuteo “ironically” with the “stiff Brit-dude”.I wonder, does he ever think about the glory days of 2010, when TV debates rang with the words “I agree with Nick”? At least he can be comforted that there’s nothing going on politically in Britain – it’s boring here. Otherwise, he seems to be experiencing a double whammy of culture-cum-generational shock. No wonder he can’t work out how to put his socks on. Clegg has been through the kind of living hell that a reputed $4m-$7m salary couldn’t begin to heal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21f2fcc6d5d0733f59fd0eaafe5aed2319f2d21b/0_56_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9971f4d94f5d577b9d29baec5fd5470","title":"gwendoline christie underdogs emmys","story":"It cost Gwendoline Christie, Alfie Allen and Carice van Houten $225 each to submit themselves for consideration to the Emmys, which, given that all three were announced as nominees last week, sounds, retrospectively, like a bit of a bargain. The Game of Thrones actors were not put forward by makers HBO, which is fair enough, I suppose, since the show had roughly 7,000 actors in every episode and not playing favourites would have been a budget-busting exercise in diplomacy. After all, they spent all their money on dragons.Apparently, it is common practice for people to submit themselves, if their network does not, but it is less common for them to actually win the nod having done so. The internet seemed impressed by the go-get-’em attitude of the trio and, to show its approval, allowed the meme of Brienne of Tarth writing in the Book of Brothers to graduate from a Sex and the CityMean Girls spoof to a symbol of knowing one’s own value and pushing for what you want.There is an aptness to the underdog feel of it all, particularly for Christie and Allen, whose Game of Thrones characters had to triumph over not being a man and having their penis chopped off, respectively. But it is also a sign of the general underdoggyness of the entire process this year, which has been a little less predictable and mainstream than usual.Of course, part of the fun is arguing over who should and should not have been included. Julia Roberts was not recognised for Homecoming, nor Emma Stone for Maniac, and nor was Christine Baranski for The Good Fight, which is particularly egregious because I think she should be given it automatically, every year. The Big Bang Theory, usually an Emmys darling, was denied a victory lap and The Kominsky Method, previously beloved, suddenly lost its shine.Meanwhile, smaller shows stepped up to the plate. The charming Schitt’s Creek surprised everyone by bagging a handful of nominations, hitman-comedy Barry picked up 17, while Fleabag (you may have heard of it) scattered its stars all over the acting categories.Given the sheer amount of television that is being produced now, for an extraordinary number of providers, it should not be a surprise that these categories seem more fragmented than usual. That’s not to say that the big guns have been ousted – GoT, Chernobyl and Veep all performed with predictable dominance – but the potential for upset is thrilling. Oh, and Better Things was robbed.BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern revealed last week that a viewer had sent her an email in which he requested she start to say the word “here” properly. In the “saying it properly” stakes, “here” is no “defibrillator”. It is no “prorogue”, a word that sounds as if it’s tripping over its own shoelaces. “Here” finding itself at the centre of a pronunciation controversy, with its four simple letters, two of which are a lowly “e”, could be the most exciting thing that has ever happened to it.McGovern is from Middlesbrough and says “here” with two syllables. She has spoken before about the importance of class ersity and encouraging more working-class people into broadcasting. Viewer Trevor, of the email fame, decided to get in touch to inform her that “your accent doesn’t bother me, apart from that one word you mangle”.I have tried, but I cannot say “here” with one syllable without sounding like someone has just performed a stealth Heimlich manoeuvre on me, or I’m testing out a very bad impression of David Cameron. Still, we might as well put Trevor to good use. He should be dispatched to the States, to lay down the law about the word “squirrel”.It takes a lot for a new movie to stand out in a week that gave us both FaceApp’s ability to imagine ourselves as more tired, weary and haggard – for the tech-averse, watching the News at Ten at seems to have the same effect – and the trailer for Cats, which is like FaceApp, but with famous people selecting “feline” instead of “without surgical intervention”. If James Corden and Judi Dench aren’t cosplaying Celebrity Big Brother 2006, the George GallowayRula Lenska edition, then I will march on the multiplex and will not be responsible for my actions.But then the trailer for Hustlers came along. Out in September, Hustlers has the cast of my dreams: Constance Wu, Lizzo, Cardi B and Julia Stiles, who will forever hold a place in the heart of this particular 10 Things I Hate About You fan. Jennifer Lopez leads as a pole-dancer with a sideline in Occupy Wall Street-style rousing speeches, who decides to turn the tables and fleece the bankers who have fleeced the people. A bit like Robin Hood, with higher heels and more impressive core strength. It’s inspired by a true story and looks like everything Ocean’s 8 should have been.This era of female-led crime capers has been a wonderful treat. The gross-out explosion – Bridesmaids into Bad Moms, Girls Trip and Rough Night – has evolved into a wave of crime movies that have invigorated the genre. Widows, outrageously overlooked for awards last year, set up a summer of bad deeds for Hustlers and The Kitchen, which sees gross-com veterans Melissa McCarthy and Tiffany Haddish muscling in on the streets of 1970s New York. If they perform well, perhaps we might get an Ocean’s 9. I’d love to see what it could do with an actual plot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fdb4a481b36407b19d4706167cd307b3da2f969f/0_806_3670_2202/master/3670.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac706373a4769ca665f476805b4feb0d","title":"adrian dunbar interview line of duty happy days beckett festival","story":"Adrian Dunbar was born and brought up in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, before attending Guildhall School Of Music \u0026amp Drama in London. His stage credits include the Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Court, while film work includes My Left Foot, Hear My Song and The Crying Game. On TV, he’s best known as Supt Ted Hastings in hit BBC cop-corruption thriller Line of Duty. This week, Dunbar directs a play at Happy Days, the annual Samuel Beckett festival in his home town of Enniskillen.How did you get involved with the Beckett festival?Curator Seán Doran found himself in Enniskillen and realised it was a beautiful town, located between two lakes, with incredible literary connections. Not only did Wilde and Beckett go to school here, but Brian Friel was born up the road, Seamus Heaney not too far away, same with Patrick Kavanagh, WB Yeats grew up in Sligo… It’s the epicentre of an amazing concentration of writing talent. Seán thought it would be wonderful place to hold a festival. Local people put him on to me and I was enthusiastic from the get-go.The inaugural festival was in 2012. How has it evolved?It got off to a cracking start because we got decent funding and brought in powerful international artists. People were fascinated to see where Beckett spent his formative years. These landscapes influenced him hugely. He spent a lot of time swimming in the lakes and excelled at sport here.Beckett was actually quite a cricketer, wasn’t he?Yes, he’s the only Nobel laureate to appear in Wisden. But not the only Irishman to be great at cricket, as Eoin Morgan proved last week.Has the festival been good for the town?It’s a two-way street: Enniskillen has done well out of visitors and locals have had their hometown opened up to them. We don’t have many purpose-built venues, so Seán puts on events in unusual spaces. You may never have seen inside the Methodist church, but during the festival, you can go in and listen to a fabulous string quartet play Schubert, Beckett’s favourite composer. It’s broken down barriers.Coming back must be a trip down memory lane?Very much so. It also saves me explaining why I’m here. People go: “Back for the festival?” I say “Yep”, and that bit’s done. It saves 20 minutes of small talk. As a kid, I remember being inspired by touring companies coming here to put on plays and meeting the actors around town. That’s when I realised this could be a profession. That point of contact for young creative people in any town is really important. They might experience something life-changing. The arts don’t care what your background is. They belong to everyone.Would you like to do more directing?The variety of switching disciplines is interesting, but I have to be careful. When something like Line of Duty happens, your profile is such that you’re asked to do different things. I’m careful not to spread myself too thinly or it just goes mad.Were you as relieved as the rest of us that Hastings wasn’t unmasked as corrupt kingpin “H” in Line of Duty’s latest series?Absolutely. Someone came up to me the other day and said: “You don’t realise how invested I was in you.” It’s extraordinary. But people had better watch out – it’s written by Jed Mercurio, so anything could happen. He’s killed off all kinds of Bafta-winners! At a time when people are finding it difficult to put their trust in anything, they thought: “If Ted’s corrupt, that’s the end.” People on Twitter were saying Ted should go in and sort out Brexit. He represents clarity, and there’s comfort in that. I’ll have to write The Thoughts of Chairman Ted. A little blue book.He’s beloved for his catchphrases. Does Jed Mercurio write them all or do you contribute?Sometimes they’re in Jed’s scripts, other times I’ll chuck something in. If we’re doing a Q\u0026ampA in Belfast, we might ask the audience to jot down a few suggestions. “I didn’t float up the Lagan in a bubble” came from one of those. “Now we’re sucking diesel” was mine. There was this crazy drinking game going around too. If I said “fella”, you had to take a gulp. If I said “mother of God”, down a whole pint. If I said “sucking diesel”, drink a whisky. By the end of the episode, there must have been blokes falling about all over the place.You’ve formed a close friendship with castmates Vicky McClure and Martin Compston. Is it true you’re the resident cook?That’s right. We stay in adjoining apartments during shooting and I’ll rustle up bowls of pasta or fry-ups. We learn our lines in Vicky’s flat. If there’s any late-night partying, that’s at Martin’s.Are you one of those actors who don’t like watching themselves on screen?I only tend to watch the bits I wasn’t in. I’ll watch Line of Duty to see what Martin and Vicky got up to while I was stuck at the AC-12 office.Do you have any dream roles you’d like to play?I’d love to do something funny. Our work often deals with tough subjects. You do your research and it can be quite dark. So after all these years of drama, I’d like to go to work someday with the sole intention of making people laugh.You turn 61 in a fortnight. How do your 60s feel?I’m just enjoying still being able to walk up a flight of stairs, so I count my blessings. Although a bit of grunting has started when I get up from a chair.What makes you happy when you’re not working?I would say going to watch Arsenal, but that’s not the enjoyable experience it used to be. Gardening, cooking, going for a pint with my mates – just the ordinary stuff.What’s up next for you?I’m currently in Dublin shooting the second series of Blood, a TV drama by a great writer called Sophie Petzal. It airs on Virgin Media here in the Republic and did big numbers for Channel 5 in the UK, so that’s exciting. This autumn I’m making a documentary about Beckett for BBC Four.

Whoever else might lay claim to that title, Trevor Horn certainly predicted pop’s most visual era as half of the Buggles, with their massive 1979 hit Video Killed the Radio Star, and then capitalised on it in the decade to come. He collaborated with that great pop showman, Malcolm McLaren, cofounded the ZTT label and brought the world Frankie Goes to Hollywood, with their indelible imagery and pristine knack for controversy.His work that decade is a murderers’ row of hits: ABC’s The Look of Love, Grace Jones’s Slave to the Rhythm, Godley \u0026amp Creme’s Cry, Pet Shop Boys’ Left to My Own Devices. He might as well have been the guy who invented the 90s, too: as part of the Art of Noise from 1983, Horn pioneered the sampling technology that would change the sound and scope of hip-hop in the years to come.His success continued through the 90s – Horn was behind Seal’s eponymous debut album – and into unexpected places in the early 2000s: ersatz Russian lesbians tATu’s English market debut, 200kmh in the Wrong Lane, contains three Horn productions, and is an underrated millennium-era classic.For better or worse (probably for better, to be fair), Lena Katina and Julia Volkova don’t appear on Horn’s most recent album, Trevor Horn Reimagines the Eighties, which employs Robbie Williams, Gabrielle Aplin, All Saints and Seal, among others, to do, well, exactly what it says on the tin. That’s the album Horn is touring this month – starting at Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on 27 July – and the occasion for his visit to  HQ, where he will be taking your questions at 1pm BST on Tuesday 23 July.

In addition to its obvious uses as a TV catch-up service, the BBC iPlayer rarely gets much credit or promotion for the breadth and intelligence of its film selection: too often I forget to check what’s on its menu for a couple of weeks, and am surprised by the accumulated treasures when I return.At the moment, for example, you can catch gems as assorted as Ben Wheatley’s excellent family-feud tragicomedy Happy New Year, Colin Burstead, Nicholas Ray’s stony-hard 1952 noir On Dangerous Ground or Miloš Forman’s whirling Andy Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon – all streaming, of course, for free. Like an eccentric but generous auntie, the iPlayer always has some manner of treat in its bag if you just rummage around for it. Covering its highlights for this column, however, can be tricky when many films have such short, limited streaming windows: like a more haphazardly structured version of Mubi, it’s not a model that permits a lot of procrastination.When it comes to content from the online-only channel BBC Three, however, there’s rather more leeway. Still going digitally three years after being dropped from the airways, the channel is hanging on to its youth-targeted remit, with laxer scheduling to match: its films hit the iPlayer for five months at a time, giving them more word-of-mouth time to find younger, less vigilantly Beeb-attuned viewers.Best of all, however, is its fresh, bracing selection of international documentaries – unlike the many fine films found in the BBC’s Storyville strand, they aren’t overly disguised with channel branding, though the broadcaster has a habit of embellishing the titles in rather naff, literal-minded ways. Rightly nominated for an Oscar it really should have won, Bing Liu’s Minding the Gap (here appearing as Minding the Gap: An American Skateboard Story) is both desperately moving and formally exhilarating in its long-term examination of two Illinois skateboarders growing up and coming to terms with damaged masculinity – both their own and that of others. If you missed it during its brief cinema run this spring, don’t sleep on it again, particularly when it’s free.A couple of festival dates aside, you wouldn’t have had a chance to catch Nancy Schwartzman’s bluntly powerful Roll Red Roll (or A High School Rape Goes Viral: Roll Red Roll, to again use the BBC’s ungainly moniker) on a big screen. The film-making is ungarnished in this fuming, activist-spirited study of high-school sexual assault, but its message is undiluted: centred on a rape case intermeshed with toxic football-team culture in an eastern Ohio school, it takes the shape of a true-crime thriller as it traces the perpetrators and consequences of the act. Riveting and conversation-starting, it’s not what most would choose to see on a night out – but it’s exactly the kind of streaming fare a public broadcaster should be making freely available.Ray \u0026amp Liz(New Wave, 15)Photographer Richard Billingham makes a vital film-making debut, dramatising his working-class childhood with social acuity and cinematic verve.3 Faces(Drakes Avenue, 15)Eight years into the film-making ban imposed on him by the Iranian government, Jafar Panahi’s darkly playful feminist mystery is his most inventive and elastic subversion of it.Alita: Battle Angel(Fox, 12)This James Cameron-scripted manga adaptation boasted dazzling 3D effects in cinemas without those, it’s just a lot of busily clanking metal.A Tree Grows in Brooklyn(Eureka, U)Elia Kazan’s first film remains less known than it should be, since it’s among his greatest: a graceful, empathetic Irish-American coming-of-age story, gorgeously transferred to Blu-ray.Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean(Eureka, 15)Another welcome Eureka re-release, Robert Altman’s elegiac bauble of Americana lives up to the oddball allure of its title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26fea040be8c49604a7e45d0b3ae1a1fb10174c6/0_205_3625_2176/master/3625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b132c621622bc55b1ab12014ef55e0","title":"africa cup of nations 2019 highs lows and moments of mayhem","story":"Algeria’s quarter-final victory against Ivory Coast felt like two top sides going head to head, the tension cranking up after Jonathan Kodjia’s equaliser and both teams hellbent on finding a winner during extra time. For aggro and drama, Senegal’s win over Tunisia in the semi-finals ran it close. Madagascar’s vibrant 2-2 draw against DR Congo, in which they came through on spot kicks, deserves a mention. For basketball-style mayhem, though, there was no more entertaining match than the Kenya and Tanzania east African derby, which was somehow restricted to a mere 3-2 win for the former.Early on it looked as if Mohamed Salah, whose two flourishes in the group stage papered over the cracks in a dreary Egypt side, might make this tournament his. But that did not last and the biggest impacts came from less celebrated names. Ismael Bennacer, apparently not good enough for Arsenal, was a force of consistency and intelligence in Algeria’s midfield and takes the gong. Most of the contenders wore Algeria shirts although Idrissa Gueye was outstanding and wielded a bigger influence on Senegal than Sadio Mané.It was not an Afcon of great goals and the winner is easy to pick for its blend of execution and theatre. Algeria looked to be tiring in their semi-final with Nigeria and extra-time seemed inevitable. Then Riyad Mahrez, who otherwise flitted in and out of the tournament, whipped a brilliant free-kick into the far corner with the last kick of the game. A few other sparkling strikes were available: Madagascar’s two goals against DR Congo encapsulated the brio in the underdogs’ play while Youssef En-Nesyri’s winner for Morocco against Ivory Coast came from a beautiful move. Overall, though, much of the action in front of goal was scruffy.Morocco proved doubts about their efficiency correct when, having created enough chances to win several games, they fell on penalties to a stodgy Benin in the last 16. Hakim Ziyech’s added-time miss from the spot will stay with him and the tournament would have been better for an extended viewing of its most entertaining side. The hosts’ no-show against South Africa also subtracted something even if their exit was deserved. Perhaps a barely watchable final was the biggest disappointment of all, particularly given that it involved two decent teams, even though expectations should always be managed before such occasions.There are a few, which is no surprise when a confederation on its knees, a hastily knocked-together tournament and a paranoid, repressive host state are combined. The first few days were a mess as accreditations went awol and supporters struggled to buy tickets for games that were played to near-empty stands. The latter was an issue from start until the very finish, with the final played to banks of vacant seats. Supporters were the last people to benefit from the Fan ID system, which is patently unsuited to a Cup of Nations. The level of personal detail required of those who did sign up, in a country whose authorities will take a mile when offered a millimetre, did little to attract locals. Where the football was concerned, a 24-team tournament made for genuinely exciting knockout rounds but at the cost of real interest during the group stage.It was a hospital pass of epic proportions when yours truly persuaded the Observer’s Ed Aarons, arriving in Egypt a day later, to transport the entire Burundi squad’s new match boots with him. When Ed found himself held up at customs for three hours in the middle of the night and threatened with a £6,000 fee for bringing his suspicious-looking packages into the country, things became fraught. It eventually ended with laughs all round although Burundi, who finished with no points and no goals, had clearly not been shopping in the “shooting” aisle of the boot store.It was a pleasure to get to know Madagascar and their coach, Nicolas Dupuis. His rise has been as big a fairytale as that of his team and his personal pride at leading them to the last eight was very touching.Egypt is clearly not a happy place and it quickly became clear that a Cup of Nations offered little more than bread and circuses to most locals. The apathy when Egypt slunk out in the round of 16 was striking. A month in Cairo – relentless, intense, cinematic – may have taken a decade or two off this writer’s life but it will be a wrench to leave. It did not take long for the hospitality and genuine desire to assist – even among the generously-staffed security forces, whose inscrutability could be melted with a little effort – to get under the skin.It is one of the world’s great cities and deserves better days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a89d3144e48aee8c7b083bdb33252a9346c2464d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50af979486038c9fafb673a3d082c382","title":"andy carroll west ham what next","story":"The very English centre-forward is surplus to requirements at West Ham but another club could surely harness his talentsWhen the time comes for a big screen Andy Carroll biopic it may be a good idea to start with a chase scene. Perhaps even that traumatic attempted heist three years ago when a man on a moped stopped Carroll’s jeep after training and tried to get him to hand over his watch.It led to some heroic quick reactions. Key details include Carroll crashing into “at least 10” cars as he drove away. Carroll shouting “I’m a Premier League footballer!” at the emergency services as he fled his pursuers. And Carroll heading rather sweetly not for the nearest police station but back to the West Ham training ground, like an antelope released into the wild and retracing the tyre tracks of its handlers, seeking the closest thing to home.Looking back now it feels an entire sporting career captured in one image.The collisions, the sense of a juggernaut surging past pursued by furies, ponytail flapping in silhouette against the flames. At the criminal trial it emerged Carroll’s attacker was found cowering in terror under a mattress. Let’s face it, he probably wasn’t hiding from the police.But then Carroll’s career has always had something stirring and elemental about it. This is a footballer gifted a wonderful range of pre-industrial talents just as we entered the digital age cursed by serious and repeated injury and now left rusting like a cold-war destroyer after his seven-year spell at West Ham came to an end at the start of this month.Look down the list and Carroll is one of many big names currently out of contract. The summer window offers the chance to snap up an entire Roy Hodgson-era England strike force, with Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck also unattached, both waiting for the dog days of mid-August where fans grow restless, anxieties start to rise and the clock strikes West Ham.With Carroll it feels, as ever, as though some wider story is being played out. It has been a strange 13 years at the top. His move to Liverpool in 2011 made him the most expensive British footballer. The last seven years have brought only 33 Premier League goals. But through that time Carroll’s influence has been oddly unignorable. This is a career that has no real narrative, no feeling of events progressing naturally from one to the next, which has instead unspooled around a series of striking, potent images.Another Carroll scene: that goal in Kiev for England against Sweden at Euro 2012. Watch it back now and it remains a startling piece of skill. Steven Gerrard piles in a deep swirling cross. Carroll rises above the yellow shirts, filling the skies like a burning zeppelin. Finally he wrenches his neck muscles, not so much heading the ball as butting it with a thrilling fury into the corner of the net. At the time it felt like the start of something. Carroll was 23 years old.This was his first competitive goal for England. It also turned out to be his last. These days it feels as though Carroll’s England career was an era-ning collision of style and intent, the embodiment of something entrenched, the old English football of the skies.In reality Carroll barely featured at all. He played his last England game only three months after that Sweden goal. In the meantime his only Premier League goals in the last two and half years have come against West Brom, Stoke and Hull City, a Carroll goal acting as a kind of death-mark, sure sign of looming relegation.In part this is a feature of those long injury absences. But really football has changed around him. Carroll first played for Newcastle in 2006, when English football was still baffled by the idea the game didn’t have to be played in a series of orderly straight lines. Even then Carroll was more than just a bludgeon. He could link the play, with a fine touch, and was brilliant at pressing defences in his youth. It is only later, as his movement has congealed, that the focus has been solely on his aerial craft.It still has its use as a corrective force. Another Carroll scene: his last great moment, the eight-minute hat-trick against Arsenal in 2016, when Carroll seemed to overwhelm a decadent late-Wenger defence like a mountain landslip, like an angry buffalo hurled from a hotel balcony, like 1500 tons of refrigerated corned beef dumped into the waves by a stricken supertanker, like nemesis, the revenge of nature or like a competent centre-forward taking advantage of slack marking on crosses to the back post.There were calls in the days that followed for Carroll to be “parachuted” into the Euro 2016 squad (Carroll is always being parachuted, deployed or unleashed). But even then it felt like a last breath of something. As of this season pretty much everything Carroll does in a penalty area will be declared illegal by VAR – a hand on the shoulder here, a high-velocity aerial body-slam there.The Premier League video panel may as well just pixelate him out of the feed, as football has been keen to do to his type, the full-contact players, ever since the rules began to change, with great vindication elsewhere.There is a sadness to all this. Carroll really does seem to love football, even as it has pushed him from place to place. And while sympathy will be in short supply – sympathy is always in short supply – he is also a victim.Carroll’s early career was lived through the years when players were treated like a kind of social experiment, subjected to relentless irradiating forces. Hurl riches their way. Bombard them with negative attention. Let’s see what peculiar shapes we can bend this human material into.Aged 30, there is still hope of something more. The dream move would, of course, be a return to Newcastle, where he was a ball boy and a fan, and where he never really wanted to leave.Most things don’t happen. This one probably won’t. Glorious homecomings rarely work out, in any case. But Carroll has always seemed to exist beyond the cold facts, an emblem of football as something more immediate and more emotional a man out of his time from the start of his time, who might just have one last big scene left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1ab5a4a24fa58ba50c6e35cbecccdfaabfeb894/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284db65a9ca528dcef9863f711542825","title":"blind date jordan and jack","story":"What were you hoping for?A new experience and an interesting story to tell my mum.First impressions?A little bit shy and a good head of hair.What did you talk about?Work, the hobbies I fibbed about, favourite alcoholic beverages and we even braved Brexit.Any awkward moments?Having to repeatedly tell the waiter in the middle of the restaurant that I was there for the  blind date.Good table manners?Yep, there wasn’t any nose-picking or double-dipping.

Three days into their visit, they had an offer accepted on a small, 19th-century cottage on Sartfell in the west of the island. The derelict cottage – the third highest on the island – sits alone on the brow of a hill and is known locally as Cloud Nine.“The cottage wasn’t really fit for 20th-century living, never mind 21st,” recalls Peter, a retired management consultant with a background in scientific research. The couple, who are both in their 60s, appointed the architect Will Foster to design a contemporary, carbon-neutral home for them next to the existing cottage.While their project was going through design and planning, the Isle of Man was applying for Unesco Biosphere Reserve status. “It was serendipity,” says Peter. “The island’s status was awarded in 2016, and this has given us a unique opportunity to do something we didn’t think possible.”The couple has built a Riba award-winning home (a first for the island) and, working with the Manx Wildlife Trust, they have transformed what was seven acres of farmland into a nature reserve. The project has been renamed Sartfell Restorative Rural Retreat, but the couple are clearly still living on cloud nine.“It is a privilege to be here,” says Carole, a retired educator. “Every morning, when we’re up having breakfast, we spot something out the window, drop our spoons and rush to get the binoculars. When we bought the land, there was nothing but grass and bit of bog,” she continues. “The bioersity has increased 1,000-fold: rare orchids, hen harriers, kestrels, buzzards, choughs and butterflies are all back in abundance and there are frogs in the new lake.”The lake was dug out of the land, and the rocks that were excavated have been used to clad the cast concrete shell of the building. “The architect installed a weather station on site and monitored the weather for a year before commencing the build,” explains Peter.Foster recorded 90mph winds on Sartfell, so the need to feel sheltered informed the design, which is moulded into the slope. Long, horizontal slot windows provide panoramic views across the reserve to Scotland and Ireland.“When the wind is howling and the rain is horizontal, we’re warm as toast in here, looking out at this wild weather,” says Peter.The lake also conceals a ground source heat pump, which heats the entire three-storey building. (A wood-burning stove is used to bump up the temperature on the coldest days.) “Pristine” spring water comes from a nearby borehole and the couple is planning to install a wind turbine, which will generate enough electricity to run their home and feed back into the grid. Turfed roofs provide further insulation and allow the new building to merge into the hill.A palette of raw materials has been used inside: cast concrete walls and polished floors run throughout the interior, and a spectacular iron staircase connects the three levels. On the lower ground floor are two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a games room, garage and plant room the kitchen, library and open- plan living space is on the middle floor and a panoramic office is at the top of the building.Having given themselves nine months to enjoy their retreat on Sartfell, the couple are about to begin the next phase of the project. Their vision – which is entirely self-funded – is to build a visitor centre and work with local charities and trusts to educate school children and eco-tourists about natural history, sustainable living and bioersity. Visitors will be able to explore the nature reserve and see how green energy works. (The original 19th-century cottage will soon be available to rent.)“There is a very healthy social conscience on the island,” says Carole. “But we need more young people to be interested in these things from an early age.” Peter adds: “A lot of the work we’ve done here is a process that will go on for the next generation. This is our last home, but it is also a resource for the future.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c12d7bed18a088889ea5a6eeccd2a9f99cbc345/0_348_5501_3301/master/5501.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a14479723a7f64aadf81877775e16bd","title":"my new novel allowed me to grieve years after losing my baby boy","story":"In 2006 the writer Clare Mackintosh gave birth to twin boys 12 weeks prematurely. At first everything went well, but then one twin picked up a dangerous infection, and mother and father were faced with a terrible decisionAuthors are told to write what they know, but my own story was, for many years, too hard to even contemplate. I was too scared to explore the emotions I kept locked away. I wrote other books instead – became known for twisty thrillers – then last year I sat at my desk with new resolve. It was time.In November 2006 I delivered twin boys 12 weeks prematurely. Josh and Alex were baby birds, with screwed-shut eyes and translucent skin. They drank my milk through a narrow tube, breathed via a mask over their tiny faces, and day by day grew stronger.By the end of our first month in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) my husband Rob and I were pros. We told new parents where the fridges were for expressed milk, the quickest route to the canteen and where to buy a parking pass. We were in by seven and home 13 hours later, our days filled with beeps and whirs, and the stillness of a ward where lives hung in the balance.Hope for the best, they tell you, but prepare for the worst. Stress was a fish bone lodged in my throat and for months I breathed shallow and fearful, as though I might choke. I still get that feeling now, triggered by a photograph, a memory, a hospital corridor.The boys made excellent progress: breathing, feeding, putting on weight. The consultant was delighted. They wouldn’t be home by Christmas, but perhaps soon after. We began to feel excited about becoming a family.Hope is a seesaw balanced by despair and it took less than two days to tip from one to the other. Alex picked up an infection called Pseudomonas, and within hours he was being intubated. His temperature was dangerously high his pulse erratic. He began fitting.Then they took us into the quiet room. The quiet room had blinds at the window and judiciously placed tissues. The crying room, it should be called, because the news delivered there is never good. We sat on a peach sofa as the consultant told us Alex had bacterial meningitis the next few days would be critical.My memory of those days is fragmented: movie scenes I watched through closed fingers. Doctors, lumbar punctures, brain scans. A cocktail of drugs snaking into veins through bruised skin. Then the quiet room again. Walking down the corridor towards it, the consultant a few steps ahead. Afterwards I wondered whether she was silently practising how to break the news.Alex had suffered a haemorrhage so extensive that no part of his brain was untouched. In time, the consultant said, he might be able to breathe independently, but it was doubtful he would ever walk or talk.“He’s unlikely to be able to swallow,” she said. Strangely, of all the terrible news delivered in the quiet room, it was this that had the biggest impact on me. “We need you to make a decision about his future.”I recall the panic starting. Not just for the decision itself but for the act of making it. The weeks in NICU – and, before that, in Maternity, legs crossed against early labour – had lost us our agency. Yet now, when it mattered most, they were handing it back.The options were both straightforward and impossible. Keep Alex alive or let him die. Seeing it like that, written with such starkness, is as horrific as it felt that day. I recall the sensation of the ground shifting beneath my feet, as though some seismic change were taking place. Whatever we decided, life would never be the same again. The consultant was gentle and compassionate. “You need to imagine two futures,” she said. “One with a profoundly disabled son, one without that son at all.”I thought of the poem by Robert Frost, The Road Not Taken. “Two roads erged in a yellow wood  And sorry I could not travel both.” I wanted to see both roads, to know for certain what lay ahead. I wanted to know how the story ended.Panic bubbled to the surface. Rob and I had been married for three years. We were good at talking things through at finding a compromise when we disagreed. But here, there could be no compromise.“What if we don’t agree?” There was the longest pause before the doctor replied. “You have to,” she said, “because the alternative is unthinkable.” It would be to the unthinkable I would return, years later, when I wrote After the End, although it was far from my mind then. Instead I was standing at Frost’s crossroads, trying to see 10 years down each path.One way: a life without Alex. A family of three instead of four. Our future on this path was unarguably clear, and unarguably painful. When I tried to visualise it, I was overwhelmed by the pain in my heart, so intense I could hardly breathe. The second road was less certain, but no less painful. A child who required round-the-clock care. Who might never have any awareness of the world around him. A child who wouldn’t kick a ball, or climb a tree, or crawl into my lap for a cuddle.We walked through the hospital grounds, numb with grief. I watched a woman and her partner carry twin babies to their car and felt a sudden rush of bitterness. Why us, not them? I blamed myself for letting the babies come early. We tried to list the arguments for each option, circling endlessly back to the same refrain. I can’t, I just can’t. I called my father, himself a doctor. I told him I needed him, not as a grandfather, but as a medical professional. I can’t imagine how he must have felt and – looking back – it seems horribly unfair to have asked him.He was calm and wise, and everything I needed. He talked about the Hippocratic oath and the importance of doing no harm. He talked about working with nature, not against it, and he gently suggested we consider not whether Alex might live, but whether that life would be meaningful – not to us, but to him.Rob and I drove home in silence, trapped in our own nightmares. We talked through the night, falling asleep on the sofa and waking to find our cheeks wet with tears, clinging to each other as though we were drowning.Back in the quiet room – how I’d grown to hate that room – we told the consultant we wanted to remove Alex from intensive care and let him die.“For what it’s worth,” she said quietly, “I think you’ve made the right decision.” I wondered if she would have said the same if we’d asked to keep him alive, if she was simply giving us the validation we so needed to hear. I hope not, because in the years since I’ve clung to her words for reassurance.They brought Alex to us, free from machines for the first time since he was born. He won’t feel any pain, they insisted, and I wished there was a drug to do the same for us. I couldn’t tell you how long the three of us sat in that room. I read him stories and sang a lullaby, while all the time I fought to stop my tears, because I didn’t want my boy to see me cry. We brushed his hair and changed his babygro, and packed a lifetime of love into every second.The days that followed are a blur. Grief and disbelief morphed into guilt. What had we done? The doctors had said might never walk, not would. They had said unlikely to swallow, not would never. Miracles happen all the time – Alex could have recovered, he could have laughed, could have loved, could have lived. “What if?” was the constant whisper in my ear. What if you’d let him live?Writing has always been my way of making sense of the world. Back then I was a police officer, not an author, but I found I had a burning need to write about what had happened. What if we’d made a different choice? What if Rob and I had disagreed? What if the doctors had been wrong? What if, what if, what if…I couldn’t have written After the End immediately after Alex died, not only because it was too raw, but because I didn’t know how it ended. As the title suggests, the story is about what happens after a life-changing event, and for us the clock had stopped. I didn’t know then that the world moves on, that it’s possible to laugh again, love again, live again. I didn’t know that Alex’s death would teach me to seize the day, to smile more, to celebrate each fleeting moment.Writing After the End was a deeply emotional experience. What happens in the book is Max’s and Pip’s story, not mine, and the filter of fiction finally enabled me to grieve. The story broke my heart all over again, but it mended it, too, and I finally made peace with our decision. None of us can predict the future, but we can shape it as it happens. We can choose to live again. After the End by Clare Mackintosh is published by Little, Brown at £12.99.

One particularly fierce preying mantis arm posture recurs in much of the night’s high-spec choreography. Her ruffled fuchsia top, matched with pink hot pants, visually combine proud folklore and Instagram-melting R\u0026ampB couture.Just as compelling, though, is the older drama of Catalina, an update of a classic flamenco ballad by Manuel Vallejo that appeared on Rosalía’s first album, Los Ángeles (2017). She asks the crowd to be as silent as it can, for what is a masterclass in vocal control as Rosalía swells from racked coo to harsh anger.Perhaps even better is A Ningún Hombre. Here, Rosalía’s dramatic a cappella is shadowed by a Greek chorus of backing vocals, laden with disorienting effects – far more like FKA Twigs than mainstream pop. “A ningún hombre consiento que dicte mi sentencia,” she declares – I’ll let no man sentence me.For a mainstream-courting artist, Rosalía draws greedily from left field. Revving motorcycle-engine percussion and screeching tyres signal De Aquí No Sales (You’re Not Getting Out of Here), a series of threats of violence from a man to a woman. Soon the dancers are back, leading the fast hand-clapping – palmas – of flamenco, as the vocals themselves seem to pixelate.Rosalía has been touring these songs for some time now – a few weeks ago, she wowed Glastonbury. But recent months have seen a concerted uptick in excitement as she has teased what everyone assumes is a forthcoming third album with a series of fiery bangers.That most-watched video of 2019 – Rosalía’s recent collaboration with Colombian reggaetón singer J Balvin, Con Altura – came out in March. At nearly 550m views, Con Altura is, in many ways, a perfect pop storm. Sung in Spanish, the language spoken by 577 million people in the world, according to a recent study, and rising (Chinese is top of the table, English is third), it reaches parts of the world that Taylor Swift cannot. Tonight, it’s greeted with ecstatic cheers by a crowd who are in great part Spanish-speaking, but not entirely.There’s not a lot of flamenco in Con Altura instead, reggaetón looms large. Initially a Puerto Rican genre, reggaetón has been spreading across the Spanish-speaking world since the 90s and has been happily co-opted by US hip hop and R\u0026ampB. (An old hand, Daddy Yankee – reggaetón’s pioneer – currently holds the crown for most-watched music video of 2019, male or female, with Con Calma.)Anglophone pop artists became wise to Spanish-language trends more generally a few years back, most obviously with Justin Bieber’s reworking of Luis Fonsi’s Despacito (2017). Pop stars such as Madonna have since fallen into line. Katy Perry jumped on Daddy Yankee’s Con Calma last April with some verses. Having begun as a flamenco moderniser, Rosalía’s entry into world pop was via reggaetón. In 2018, her first massive exposure came on the back of her first collaboration with J Balvin, a guest slot on his Brillo single, reprised tonight.Con Altura, which was her second co-sign with Balvin, is more than just the right song in the right language with the right syncopation at the right time: it’s also awesome. “Altura” is easy to grasp, whatever your mother tongue – Spanish for “height” or “altitude”, loosely, “con altura” here means “with swagger” (with the merest hint of “being high”). The video is, playfully, set on a plane. In interviews, the 25-year-old is at pains to emphasise how visuals and choreography hold equal weight to her music. Flamenco is, of course, both cante (song) and baile (dance).A week ago, Rosalía upped her game again with the double-whammy of Dios Nos Libre Del Dinero (God Free Us from Money) and Milionària, collectively released as Fucking Money Man – a rare incursion of English into Rosalía’s art. Performing it, the spotlight is on her alone, as the singer considers the root of all evil in one breath, and then, in an explosion of dancers, palmas and geyser-like vocals, plays devil’s advocate for the folding stuff moments later. There’s another outbreak of English in a captivating cover of James Blake’s Barefoot in the Park, as per the collaboration between the two artists released in April this year.There have been questions asked in Catalonia about Rosalía’s singing Milionària in Catalan, while using Spanish expressions: s of the Catalan language consider it wrong to dilute it with Spanish. A debate also rages within flamenco over Rosalía’s cultural appropriation of Gypsy traditions. But tonight’s crowd has nothing but love for this artist, whose mission is to modernise the ancient emo of flamenco and play with genre assumptions. That she does so with a knock-out voice, eye-watering imagery, wit and style is la guinda del pastel – the icing on the cake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59e50977069728d6155d217c88e141aa2501ce0/0_18_4904_2944/master/4904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc1052292384ee91932455652a219d97","title":"has brexit saved the lib dems","story":"The Lib Dems have made an extraordinary comeback in 2019 because of their anti-Brexit stance.

The planned reforms are intended to dovetail with Labour’s plans to renationalise the railways, the Royal Mail and the public utilities.Gwynne will say: “Our plan will be the largest set of reforms of local government in generations, rebuilding local government capacity and giving power back to communities – because public services belong to local people, and people are more important than profit.”Labour will argue that the original justification for outsourcing – that private companies offer better value for money to taxpayers – has proved incorrect. It says the collapse of Carillion – the construction and facilities management company – in 2018 highlighted the risk of private provision, but that poor service quality and standards go beyond one-off cases. Local councils – including those in the north London borough of Islington, in Nottingham, Sefton, Halton and Stoke-on-Trent – have already been bringing services back in-house.Labour is braced for widespread opposition to its local government blueprint. But it says claims that insourcing will place unsustainable cost burdens on councils, will lead to skimping on performance, or will contravene EU law, can be answered.A policy document to be presented at the launch will list seven key attractions of insourcing:Labour says its new framework for insourcing won’t require compensation to contractors because councils will wait until contracts are up or lawfully terminated before bringing services back in-house.McDonnell will say: “After year upon year of failures the public has rightly lost confidence in the privatisation of our public services and the carve-up of the public realm for private profit. The government’s ideological pursuit of privatisation and outsourcing has seen the public pay the price as fat cat bosses count their profits.“It’s time to end the outsourcing scandal which has seen private companies rip off the taxpayer, degrade our public services and put people at risk whilst remaining wholly unaccountable to the people who rely on and fund these services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83043fa3d01e00a970c0f1cf47eddb30215a5b00/0_0_2375_3600/master/2375.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9ef01892bdf21a0edda9c4a845321bf8 2020w","title":"teach primary school children about fgm say campaigners","story":"National FGM Centre says issue can be taught in ‘child-centred, age-appropriate way’Primary schools should start teaching pupils about female genital mutilation when a new relationships and health education curriculum is introduced next year, campaigners say.Secondary school pupils will be taught about the dangers of FGM from 2020 but experts fear that for some vulnerable girls these lessons will come too late.Most girls who are subjected to mutilation undergo the practice before they are 10 years old, according to the National FGM Centre’s research.The process, which involves removing a female’s external genitalia, was banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2003 but persists in some communities. Young girls are often taken abroad to be cut.Earlier this year, England had its first successful prosecution of an FGM case, which involved a three-year-old girl mutilated by her mother.The National FGM Centre – which is a partnership between children’s charity Barnardo’s and the Local Government Association – wants to see the practice completely stamped out by 2030.It says teaching the issue across the country, regardless of the demographic of the community, is beneficial as it teaches children their body belongs to them and no one is allowed to harm them.Leethen Bartholomew, the head of the National FGM Centre, said: “While some may have reservations about children being taught about this issue at primary school, the work of the National FGM Centre has shown this can be done in a child-centred, age-appropriate way.“By teaching primary school pupils about FGM, we are empowering the next generation to speak up about the issue. But it’s not just down to the next generation to break the silence.“Everyone, regardless of their community, gender or profession must be part of this conversation, so FGM becomes less of a hidden crime.”The National FGM Centre has produced guidance for primary school teachers about how to introduce the subject and how to engage with parents and support them in discussion with their children.A spokesman for the Department for Education said: “It is important that all children understand that FGM is an abhorrent crime which causes immeasurable harm to its victims and their families.“From September 2020, as part of the new relationships and sex education curriculum, all children will be taught that FGM is a criminal offence and about the emotional and physical damage it causes.“Whilst it must be taught in secondary school, primary schools can choose to teach it if they think it is appropriate for their cohort of pupils and provided it’s taught in an age-appropriate way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d05f4be051e62b913839b7151e485d56ee2b1a/0_133_3675_2205/master/3675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ff3df166f093d525edbff4ba330cbc","title":"england new zealand netball world cup semi final match report","story":"• England 45-47 New Zealand• England slip to defeat after leading 24-21 at half-timeEngland were knocked out of the Netball World Cup after a tense and tight 47-45 defeat against New Zealand at the M\u0026ampS Bank Arena.The hosts suffered an early scare in their semi-final as Maria Folau gave New Zealand a 5-0 lead inside the first four minutes.Folau, who had been booed during the pre-game introductions after recently defending her husband Israel’s controversial religious beliefs, scored four from four to get the Silver Ferns off to a flying start.After showing some nerves in front of goal, England recovered to haul back the deficit but still faced a big task as they trailed 12-9 at the end of the first.Nerves continued to be in evident for England who slipped six points behind midway through the second quarter, prompting coach Tracey Neville to make changes.Neville switched the respective roles of Housby and the misfiring Harten, and introduced Natalie Haythornthwaite in place of Chelsea Pitman.The move made a dramatic difference as Housby hauled England level before Harten belatedly rediscovered her form to shoot her team 24-21 in front with a quick-fire triple before the break.England struggled to sustain their momentum, with the accuracy of Folau and Amelianne Ekenasio dragging New Zealand back level in a match which showed all the signs of going down to the wire.Looking more composed, the Silver Ferns edged two points clear before a rare mistake by England captain Serna Guthrie enabled Ekenasio to stretch New Zealand’s lead to three.After a quarter they will want to forget, England faced going into the final 15 minutes needing to make up a 36-33 deficit in order to keep their World Cup dream alive.But despite a determined effort in the final quarter, England could not close the gap and New Zealand were able to hold on to set up a final meeting with Australia.• Emma John’s report from the will appear here shortly"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8aae789310dc5d910c2a8f51841ea198df523fed/0_358_4273_2565/master/4273.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eada370b9870cfee82160c32a521ad22","title":"england v australia womens ashes test day three","story":"45th over: England 124-4 (Sciver 11, Taylor 0) Perry to Sciver - another important period of the Test Match beginning here. Taylor’s highest score in Tests is 40, which is hard to believe given what a player she has been. Sciver leaps on a short and wide offering, timing it through the gap just behind point to move into double figures, then off strike with one to long leg. With three balls left and Taylor on strike, Lanning takes a good 60 seconds to se the field in front of the England ‘keeper, with a couple of slips in place for her first delivery. Nothing comes of it.For the umpteenth time, Jones is out between 50 and 100. It’s not a flattering dismissal, dancing to the pitch but giving catching practice to Haynes at mid-off. 43rd over: England 119-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 6) Perry continues and its an improved over compared to the two she sent down before the tea interval, Sciver careful in defence throughout. Maiden.42nd over: England 119-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 6) RUN OUT CHANCE! Sciver took on mid-off and had to e at the non-strikers’ end, Haynes ever so close to a second direct hit dismissal. The shot was in the air to begin with, too. A nervous start, Molineux right on the money. Another cricketer who looks built for Test cricket.The players are back on the field. Jones (64) and Sciver (5) make their way back to the middle. Molineux has the ball in her hand from the pavilion end. PLAY! An excellent session for England. Yes, they lost a couple of wickets. But far more importantly, they got the board moving in the right direction, adding 115. With 42 overs remaining today, the deficit is 302. More importantly, the follow-on mark 153 from being overtaken. Once they get there, Heather Knight and the England brains trust have options. By contrast, if Australia’s spinners can keep it ragging - especially Sophie Molineux, the best so far today - they could roll through them. 41st over: England 118-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 5) Perry in to Sciver, which is what she wants, but the radar is slightly off so the all-rounder can ease one to backward square. Now at Jones, she elects to redirect to around the wicket but the opener is savvy enough to avoid temptation outside the off-stump, thrice shouldering arms. Back over the wicket for the final delivery of the session, she leaves again. TEA! 40th over: England 117-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 4) Jonassen with what should be the penultimate over of the session. She is giving Jones a chance to swing with plenty of flight but the opener is content picking out cover rather than taking the field on. Jonassen gets through it quickly enough to ensure Perry can have another pop.39th over: England 117-3 (Jones 64, Sciver 4) Perry is back, Lanning no doubt mindful of her record against Sciver. She starts on leg stump, turned by Jones to deep backward square for one, placing the all-rounder on strike with seven minutes left until tea. Perry is on her hip though, the all-rounder fetching two more to backward square. Oooh, one keeps low. Sciver is up to the task. Contest!This is a bit different in that, England just need time and control. Getting back out into the field as early as possible earns them both. They need a Sciver special.38th over: England 113-3 (Jones 63, Sciver 2) Nice shot Nat Sciver to begin, on the back foot punching through cover for a couple, stopped by Schutt with a fine chase and e on the rope. In terms of England’s required rate to keep the game moving towards 271, it isn’t the wost thing that Sciver is out there now with Taylor next.Brilliant by Bolton! Elwiss to the danger end was running hard but Bolton at short cover was on it in a flash and hit middle stump. Out by four inches. Ten dot balls followed by a risky quick single - how often do we see it?37th over: England 111-2 (Jones 63, Elwiss 9) Gardner in right in her groove from around the wicket, Elwiss very happy to lean forward to smother the spin. 36th over: England 111-2 (Jones 63, Elwiss 9) Boom! Jones gets one in her arc from Jonassen to finish and makes no mistake, lofting over mid-on for her 12th boundary. I don’t want to mozz her, but... Test ton on debut has a nice ring to it.35th over: England 105-2 (Jones 58, Elwiss 8) Gardner through another broadly accurate over, only slipping with one delivery, Jones pulling that to a sweeper. 34th over: England 103-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 7) Jonassen and co are up for leg before, Alex Wharf turning it down. The first replay suggests that it was perhaps hitting just outside the off-stump, but not far away at all. Tea is 20 minutes away, this session (and the next) extended by 15 minutes. Mel Jones is asked on TV whether Australia will be happy with a draw. “You are kidding, right?” her response. Agreed. Any suggestion that Australia were attempting to kill the game with their first innings batting sells England’s bowling, on this tough track, well short. It was bat then pad earlier in the over, further replays from earlier in the over confirm. 33rd over: England 102-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 6) Oooh dear me! Gardner has drifted across Jones from around the wicket, cutting back through the gate to miss off-stump by the narrowest margin. We saw how effective Gardner was in this country during the 2017 World Cup, always a big turner of the ball. She gets away with one here, Jones unable to put away a ball down the legside. “Stay patient,” says Healy, who is giving us a nice special comments stream through the stump mic.32nd over: England 100-2 (Jones 57, Elwiss 5) Jonassen has been spun around to replace Molineux. “Let’s go, workhorse!” says the ever-vocal Healy with the left-arm ortho now bowling from the pavilion or graveyard end. Jones adds another behind point, Elwiss driving two to cover to bring up the England 100. Nice going.31st over: England 97-2 (Jones 56, Elwiss 3) Meg Lanning must be reading the OBO - here comes Ash Gardner for her first trundle in Test cricket, in from the River End on this sunny Taunton afternoon. She is operating around the wicket from the get-go, generating a nice bit of dip at Elwiss who can’t get her around the corner, taking the fourth delivery behind point for one instead. Jones retains the strike with a clipped single off the front foot, her timing getting better and better.30th over: England 91-2 (Jones 55, Elwiss 2) Molineux gives a bit of air to Jones who advances to launch her straight back over her head for four, moving to 50 with the shot at the first time of asking in Test cricket. She has reached the milestone in 96 balls, striking ten fours along the way. Has to double up now and get England to that magic 271 figure. Oh, make that 11 fours, the final ball of the over a ropey full toss, picked up over midwicket for the easiest of boundaries. 29th over: England 87-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 2) Excellent maiden from Jonassen to Elwiss, who is being asked a question with every delivery aimed at the stumps. After copping plenty of tap early on, the Queenslander now has 7-3-20-0. 28th over: England 87-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 2) Elwiss plays another little sweep to get off strike early in the Molineux over, Jones digging in for the rest. Might be time to get Ash Gardner on, an off-spinner who gives it such a mighty rip. 27th over: England 86-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 1) Elwiss off the mark first ball of the new Jonassen over lapping one behind square. Jones is forward to the rest, leaving no gap between bat and pad. She’s looking very good. This has to be the day when she goes to three figures for England having so often fallen between 50 and 100.“I know it’s the centre-piece,” writes John Nield, “which by definition goes in the middle. But it does nothing for tests if one team starts the only test just needing a draw.” I agree. The points system also doesn’t help with all these even numbers. I would recast with T20s worth two, ODIs three and the Test five for the win, to the draw. There are plenty of other improvements along the lines you are talking about, too.26th over: England 85-2 (Jones 47, Elwiss 0) Molineux is now over the wicket, looking for the footmarks that have been on offer for tweakers throughout this match. She finds them a couple of times, beating Jones’ bat, but overpitches to finish with the opener clipping expertly past square leg for her ninth boundary. 25th over: England 81-2 (Jones 43, Elwiss 0) This is the Jonassen we have learned to expect, operating around the wicket with plenty of flight at Jones. Jones keeps the strike with one out to cover. She’s the England player most likely so far today.“It’s late here in Queensland,” says Phil Withall. “I suspect that Australia just have to turn up for the rest of the series to retain the Ashes but I’m not a realist, I’m an English cricket fan and a Norwich City supporter. Nobody expected Norwich to beat Bayern Munich back in 1993, nobody expected the Ashes win in 2005 and nobody sees England getting anything from this series. Yet I still have hope, I still believe! I probably should go to bed.”Well, if they want to win the have to declare 149 behind. A famous number in English Ashes history as well, innit? On the other hand, getting to 271 would be a pretty decent effort with the turn this pitch is now taking. 24th over: England 80-2 (Jones 42, Elwiss 0) Ooh! Elwiss is nearly run out first ball by Mooney under the lid in close, the new batter dragging her back foot. The throw misses. A wicket maiden for Molineux, who has been outstanding. A first Test wicket for Sophie Molineux! Knight is sweeping and missing, the ball going on with the arm, hitting her bang in front. No doubt about that.23rd over: England 80-1 (Jones 42, Knight 28) Jonassen has bounced back well after copping some serious tap to begin, sending down two maidens either side of drinks. Jones plays her watchfully.22nd over: England 80-1 (Jones 42, Knight 28) “How has that missed?!” roars Healy from behind the stumps when Molineux beats Knight with another superb delivery, evading the edge and off-stump by the proverbial coat of varnish. Drinks! A fine shift for England. With 61 overs remaining today, they should be able to get up to that 271 mark that I was talking about a couple of overs ago. 21st over: England 79-1 (Jones 41, Knight 28) Much better from Jonassen, belatedly finding her range. Knight plays back a maiden with a minimum of fuss. 20th over: England 79-1 (Jones 41, Knight 28) Molineux now gives Jones something to hit, a full toss clobbered back over her head! She’s riden her luck to a certain extent but we know the sort of form she’s been in until the ODIs.Meanwhile, what do you think of my declaration suggestion for England?

Do join my esteemed colleague Niall McVeigh on Sunday for the final. But, for now, get stuck into this report of events in Liverpool. Tracey Neville talks. “New Zealand came out really strong in that first quarter, we didn’t learn our lessons quick enough and we always seemed to be chasing the game,” she says. “We gave it our all but we just didn’t have the legs that we needed. Fair dos, it was a class performance from New Zealand and that is probably the only game this tournament where we have made basic errors. They did a great job on us and we left it too late.” England will duel with South Africa on Sunday for the bronze medal. “We will go again.”The Silver Ferns will play Australia in Sunday’s final! Heartbreak for hosts England, despite a lung-busting, gut-busting performance. The goal shooter Maria Folau and goal attack Ameliaranne Ekenasio were ultimately the difference, an irresistible combination at times. But England more than did themselves proud. A brilliant advert for the sport, and yet more end-to-end drama in Liverpool.Q4 14 min: NZ lead 46-44! And they are eating down the clock.Q4 13 min: New Zealand lead 45-43! One hundred-odd seconds to play!Q4 12 min: And then Helen Housby goes one better! England trail by just two goals now. They can’t, can they? Tracey Neville’s side are giving it helluva go ...Q4 12 min: Jo Harten strikes for England! NZ lead 44-41!Q4 11 min: New Zealand take the sting out of the England fightback, with Folau doing what she does best, looping in another cool finish. NZ reinstate a three-goal lead. For evidence of how unrelenting NZ have been, Ameliaranne Ekenasio just had to put a trainer back on, after it slipped off in the heat of battle. Can the Silver Ferns see it out, or will England come up with the goods late on?Q4 8 min: New Zealand lead 42-38. A timely interception and Shannon Saunders does superbly to help the ball into the path of Folau. And, it goes without saying, but the Ferns’ goal shooter buried the chance that followed.Q4 7 min: New Zealand edge into a 41-37 lead after Guthrie is cautioned for persistent obstruction. Things are beginning to slip away from England.Q4 5 mins: Ten minutes of play left in this relentless final. “Amazing that NZ shooter Ameliaranne Ekenasio has NOT missed,” says Erin Delahunty. “She’s one of two mothers on the court for the Ferns. The other is Casey Kopua.”Q4 4 min: New Zealand lead 38-36! Guthrie is penalised for holding on to the ball for too long, exceeding the three-second limit. But Harten nicks the ball back from New Zealand, pumping her chest in celebration and Housby does the rest, looping home another priceless riposte. England trail by just the two, now.Q4 2 min: England trail 38-34! Harten has an off-moment and an unforgiving New Zealand side seize on a clumsy error. Folau with the merciless finish.Q4 1 min: England get off to a flyer, with Harten weighing in with another cool finish. Will New Zealand reach a sixth successive World Cup final, or can England navigate their way to a maiden appearance in the event’s showpiece?A quick reminder the winner will face Australia in Sunday’s final:New Zealand lead England 36-33. Helen Housby nets in the final seconds to tee up a riveting fourth and final decisive quarter.Q3 13 mins: New Zealand lead 35-31! Guthrie, the England captain, appears to be struggling. She has given absolutely everything here. “Another England-New Zealand World Cup knockout might be settled by a tie-breaker if the match continues being this close,” emails Abhijato Sensarma. New Zealand have, however, made a few big strides in the last couple of minutes. Super over, anyone?Q3 12 mins: England trail 32-31! There is simply no let-up, no margin for error. Just as Housby senses blood, Ekenasio nudges New Zealand back in front. “It’s so loud inside M\u0026ampS Arena the players are obviously struggling to hear the whistle,” says Erin Delahunty. Remember, a full report from Liverpool will follow.Q3 10 mins: Inseparable. Twenty-nine apiece. This is nerve-wracking netball in all its glory. Goal attack Ameliaranne Ekenasio finds a timely equaliser for New Zealand after England regained a one-goal lead. Who can sneak in front with five minutes left of this quarter? We are in for a barnstorming finish.Q3 7 mins: 27-27 it is! A sumptuous leveller by Folau. “Loving the updates Ben – no coverage in Cyprus!” tweets Kate Jones. “Let’s go, third quarter is ours!”Q3 6 mins: Harten dinks in another, moments after the substitute Shannon Saunders cancelled out her earlier effort. You could cut the tension with a knife. Q3 5 mins: New Zealand find an equaliser! It’s 25-25 in Liverpool. The Silver Ferns have come flying out of the blocks, leading this quarter 4-1. But here come England on the counter ...Q3 4 min: Well, then. Folau is human after all, missing a simple chance with the net gaping. England patiently try to rebuild. They look to Harten and Housby, who inadvertently collide in attack. But New Zealand turnover and Ameliaranne Ekenasio coolly sinks a goal to close the gap. England lead 25-24.Q3 2 min: England lead 25-23. Goal shooter Maria Folau has been a prolific force for the Silver Ferns. She, effortlessly, loops a couple of early shots into the net, but Tracey Neville’s side are quick to reply. A neck-and-neck start here.Q3 1 min: Laura Langman kickstarts the third quarter with the centre pass. Can they regain control of this one? England look thoroughly revved-up.Half-time emails. “Go the Kiwis ... make up for the cricket,” says Jo Davies. As for Tor Turner, he has helluva tale to tell. “Not a big netball fan, but I did play at school in my youth, and I’m enjoying watching the Roses come back into this game with some serious pace and aggression,” Tor begins. “Bit of a shock to see my old school netball teacher, Kathleen Edwards (but always known as Miss Edwards to us), sat in behind Tracy Neville in the bench area. By all accounts she’s a bit of a legend and did take our school netball team to nationals a number of times, so I shouldn’t really be surprised she’s still involved with the game. I do however have the honour of being the worst pupil she ever encountered in 30 years of teaching, in her own words, so fingers crossed she doesn’t remember me at all!”What will Tracey Neville’s half-time team-talk consist of? More of the same, essentially. They finished the second quarter with some real gusto. No need for the Sir Alex Ferguson hairdryer treatment that her brothers, Gary and Philip, will have been on the receiving end of at Manchester United during their career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44e1482ebdc5c4c24f31dd34483a8b2c954e9a3c/118_0_3382_2029/master/3382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35407ac08ff21b34e323e3c2bc0101b8","title":"the open golf 2019 third round live royal portrush","story":"Justin Harding’s hot chip at 5 costs him a double. He clatters down the standings to -6. A wonderful fast start was all for nought. “Lee Westwood leading! He couldn’t, could he? Let’s make sure. Someone throw Stewart Cink into the boot of a car and start driving, now!” Hubert O’Hearn there, with advice that comes ten years too late for poor old Tom Watson.Disaster for Justin Harding at 5, as his chip into the green takes a flyer. It bounds through the green, and settles in the dry moat running behind. That’s OB. Bogey for Jordan Spieth at 6, and he slips back to -6. But it’s three birdies in a row for Lee Westwood, who splits the fairway at 4, wedges to 15 feet, then rolls in the putt! A fairytale in the making here. Imagine if the eternal bridesmaid finally catches the bouquet!-10: Westwood (4), Holmes (3)-9: Lowry (3)-8: Harding (4), Fleetwood (4)-7: Schauffele (11), Rose (5)-6: There are a lot of people at -6JB Holmes had gone close as well, though. Straight at the flag, leaving a straight six-footer. In goes the birdie effort. Lowry follows him in. This is really special.Rickie Fowler’s stealthy creep up the leaderboard continues apace! It’s back-to-back birdies, the latest at 11, and he’s -6. There’s no bigger student of links golf, and there’d be no more popular winner than the likeable Californian. Well, OK, maybe Shane Lowry has dibs on that. And speaking of the big man ... he lands his tee shot at the par-three 3rd just to the right of the cup. One bounce past, and he nearly spins it back for an ace! He’ll surely make birdie from a couple of feet.Lee Westwood takes sole ownership of the lead after clacking his tee shot at the par-three 3rd to six feet! What a start for the major-championship nearly man! He’s -9. Though he’s soon joined there by JB Holmes, who sends a delightfully judged putt up the swale and across the warped 2nd green, his ball stopping 18 inches to the left of the hole. Shane Lowry has to make do with par, after chipping up from further out and taking a couple of putts. Meanwhile birdie for Justin Harding, who bundles his second into 4 off the camber to the right of the green, and strokes home a left-to-right putt from eight feet.Justin Rose with a sensational par save on 4! He’s always out of position, down the left of the hole, but rakes in a 40-footer to remain at -7. That’ll feel nice and tingly, and he celebrates accordingly. Plenty of support from the gallery too. His partner Brooks Koepka misses a 12-footer for birdie. He’s not been confident with the flat stick all week. There was footage of him on the practice green the other day, yipping one from Rory-at-16 distance, suggesting something’s nagging away at him. Could it be his Achilles heel this week? He’s only two off the lead at -6, so probably not.There’s not been much backwards movement among the leading players. But here’s something: Cameron Smith misses a tiddler on 3 and slips back to -6. Meanwhile neither of the final pair can find the par-five 2nd in two. Both tug their approaches down the swale to the left. Lowry in particular is left with a puzzle, as his ball rolls into a ot amid the semi-rough.It’s three birdies in four holes for Xander Schauffele. He’s not dropped a shot since Thursday afternoon, and he’s -7. Meanwhile news of Rickie Fowler, who has evaded the radar for most of the week despite plodding along nicely. An early bogey today at 4, but he’s since responded with birdies at 5, 7 and 10, and at -5 is just three off the lead. Birdie at the par-three 3rd for Justin Harding, meanwhile, thanks to a lovely tee shot to ten feet. And nearly an eagle for Lee Westwood at 2! He tidies up for birdie, and joins the leaders! This is such a great leaderboard.The wind that had been forecast simply hasn’t arrived. Hence the birdie blitzes all across the course. Can either of the final pair make one at the opening hole? JB Holmes has apparently quickened up his game since copping for plenty of abuse regarding his glacial pace of play. Apparently. Having failed to get his approach close, he takes an absolute age to work out the long putt, and the speed of his ball matches the speed of his decision-making process. It’s well short. But he rams in a six-footer to scramble his par. Just. His ball thought about staying up for a second there. Lowry, working at ten times the pace, knocks a medium-length birdie putt to kick-in distance. A pair of pars.Away from the hubbub at the 1st ... hubbub elsewhere! Birdies for Henrik Stenson at 8, Park Sang-hyun at 14, and Tony Finau at 4. All rise to -6. Another one for Justin Thomas, too, and he’s up to -5. And Cameron Smith birdies 2 to join Spieth, Rose and Westwood at -7.An ovation that would rattle your fillings at the first tee, as Ireland’s Shane Lowry takes to the stage. He sends a slightly nervous iron towards the thick stuff down the right, but the ball takes a kind bounce left and sits up in the semi. JB Holmes splits the fairway with his tee shot. More bedlam. And if the final pairing didn’t already know that things have suddenly got very real, up on the green Tommy Fleetwood begins his charge with an opening birdie, ramming in a right-to-left 20-foot slider. Almost immediately, Southport’s finest grabs himself a share of the lead!Another birdie for Danny Willett! His fifth of the day, at the par-five 12th. At -6, he’s just a couple of shots off the lead. Meanwhile birdies for Jordan Spieth at 3, and Justin Rose at 2, whisk that pair up to -7, one shy of JB Holmes and Shane Lowry’s 36-hole mark. And right on cue, here come the leaders. They’ll tee off with the breath of the chasing pack on their necks. A chasing pack that now contains a certain Brooks Koepka, who nearly made eagle at 2.A very disappointing back nine carded by Shubhankar Sharma. The young Indian prospect turned in level-par 36, but made five bogeys in the next six holes, and ended up signing for a 77. He clatters down the standings to +6. Not a great day for last year’s final-day hero Eddie Pepperell, either. A hungover 67 gave him the clubhouse lead for a while, and eventually a share of sixth, and there’s a fair chance he’ll be hitting the pop on Saturday evening again. A decent start today, with birdie at 2, but six subsequent bogeys led to a 76. He’s +5.An’s first slip of the day. A bogey at 9, the result of a yipped tiddler. But he’s still turning round in 33. He’s -5. Heading the other way: Xander Schauffele, who rolls in a 15-footer on 8 for back-to-back birdies. How he’ll wish he configured his driver properly on Thursday morning, before running up that out-of-whack 75. He’s -6. And the Californian is joined there by Jordan Spieth of nearby Texas, who picks up a stroke at the generous par-five 2nd.Dylan Frittelli is bidding to become the first man to win the Open wearing spectacles since Ian Baker-Finch in 1991. (David Duval’s sunglasses in 2001 don’t count.) The 29-year-old South African wears thick brims imagine a less-flustered version of ITV political editor Robert Peston, and there you have it. Frittelli’s in hot form after winning last week’s John Deere to earn his place here, and he nearly drains a monster eagle putt at 2. He’s so unfortunate as his ball breaks just to the left during the last turn of a 70-foot journey. But he joins the lads at -6.An keeps on keepin’ on! He clips his second at the box-fresh 8th straight at the flag, six feet short. In goes the putt, and it’s his fourth birdie of the day. He’s only hit an average of one in three fairways so far! He’s the first player today to join the group at -6. Birdie for Schauffele at 7 he joins the popular -5 gang. And a little more detail on Willett’s birdie at 10: he benefited from a massive break, as he sent his approach towards the grassy banks on the left, only for his ball to twang back into the heart of the green and stop a few feet from the flag. Hey, take your luck when it comes.Look at this. There are 19 players within three shots of the lead! This Open is almost obnoxiously entertaining. And we’re only just past the halfway mark!The 2017 PGA champ Justin Thomas is making a serious move today. Another birdie at 8, then he hits the turn in 33. He’s -4. And Danny Willett is going along even better: having also turned in 33, he makes his fourth birdie of the day at 10. He’s -5. It really is all going on.Alex Noren has started well. Birdies at 2 and 4, and the 37-year-old Swede, who finished in a tie for sixth at Birkdale a couple of years ago, joins the ever-growing group at -5. The latter birdie is seriously fortuitous, as he batters a long putt from the fringe with far too much conviction. Had the hole - and the flagstick - not got in the way, that ball was sailing off the other side of the green. Reward for laser-guided accuracy, I guess, but Noren has the good grace to blow out hard in the theatrical style. He’s joined at -5 by Jon Rahm, who nearly makes an eagle putt from the side of 2, but settles for his par.Another birdie for Park Sang-hyun! His fourth of the day, thanks to a trundle across 10. He joins the group at -5. As does Matt Kuchar, who nearly chips in for eagle at 2, but birdie will suffice. You could throw a blanket over the top 16. This round is shaping up to be a riot.Dustin Johnson should have back-to-back birdies on his card ... but he doesn’t. After making one at the inviting par-five 2nd, he clips his tee shot at 3 pin high to six feet, as good an effort as we’ve seen today. But he gives the putt a rare old skelp, and the ball trundles through the break. A costly rush of blood. Par, and he remains at -4.The 2016 champ Henrik Stenson makes back-to-back birdies! He races in a 40-footer across 3, and makes it up to -5. His partner Webb Simpson, the 2012 US Open champion, matches him shot for shot. And they’re both joined at -5 by An Byeong-hun, who solves another putting puzzle at 5. This one is from 20 feet, but over a hump jutting in from the left, causing issues of both line and pace. He solves both as his ball kicks right and drops into the cup at perfect weight. Also: another birdie for Danny Willett, reward for his sending his second shot at 8 to 12 feet and guiding in the gentle right-to-left slider. With the wind down, it’s all happening again!An Byeong-hun had no record to speak of in the majors ... until a tie for 16th at Pebble Beach last month. Full of fresh confidence, the 27-year-old South Korean - a former British PGA champion at Wentworth (2015) - is going along nicely today. He’s followed up birdie at 2 with another at 4, the latter thanks to a 30-foot wonder putt from the fringe at the back of the green, the ball taking a 90-degree right-turn halfway along its route to the cup. He’s -4. Meanwhile birdies for Henrik Stenson and Webb Simpson at 2, and they move to -4 too.We spoke earlier of 2011 amateur sensation Tom Lewis. Eagle at 2 was soon erased by bogeys at 3 and 6, but the 28-year-old from Welwyn Garden City regained his momentum in style, picking up birdies at 9, 12 and 14 on his way to a fine 68. He’s -2 having made a decent advance up the standings today.A most pleasing start for the 2016 Masters champion Danny Willett. Birdies at 3 and 5 and he’s currently tied for 20th at -3. Willett was in the final pairing on Sunday in 2015, though weather delays meant that was only the third round. Still, he ended the week tied for sixth, his best performance at the Open. He’s coming off the back of a tie for 12th at last month’s US Open, his highest finish in a major since winning at Augusta, so confidence should be replenished after a couple of barren, injury-hit years. Onwards and upwards!The wind has dropped, so there should be a concomitant improvement in scoring. Schauffele makes his first birdie of the day at the par-five 2nd, to move to -4. Thorbjorn Olesen rises to -3 after a birdie-bogey-birdie run between 2 and 4. But Thomas Pieters ships a shot at 4 to slip back to -3.Russell Knox birdies 9 to turn in 34. He’s -3. Birdie for Justin Thomas at 5, his second of the day after 2, and he rises to -3 as well. There was an early birdie for etiquette specialist Robert MacIntyre at 2 the 22-year-old from Oban is -3 overall through 5. And Joost Luiten has just carded three birdies in a row, at 11, 12 and 13, to rise to -3. A fine response to back-to-back bogeys at 9 and 10.Early birdies for big-hitting Thomas Pieters, at 2 and 3. Belgium’s finest joins late-blooming South Korean Park Sang-hyun, who has birdied 2, 4 and 5, in making inroads at the business end of the leaderboard. Look see!A brisk start by the 2002 and 2012 champion Ernie Els. Birdies at 2 and 3. Should the veteran triumph tomorrow, he’d break the record held since the 1968 PGA by Julius Boros for oldest major winner. Somebody’s going to do that some day, so why not the Big Easy? Nobody thought he had much of a chance at Lytham seven years ago, either, and look what happened there. Ah bugger, I’ve spoken too soon, he’s just bogeyed 4. Still, he’s -3 and going along nicely. Sorry, Ernie.We have another early mover and it’s Korean Park Sang Hyun. The world number 141 honed his links skills over the last fortnight by playing the Irish and Scottish Opens and, despite a pair of missed cuts, three of his four rounds were in the 60s. Three birdies in his first six holes today and he finds himself just four off the lead. The 36-year-old punched his ticket to Portrush after making birdie at six of his final nine holes at the Japan Tour’s Mizuno Open last month.On that enjoyably obscure fact, I’ll hand you back to Scott Murray!McDowell brushes in the birdie putt at 18 and, for now, that’s the clubhouse lead of 2-under. A sprinkle of magic at the end to complete an impressive third lap of Royal Portrush. Add that to Shane Lowry’s flying start and Rory’s brave attempt to rise from the dead, and the Irish players have certainly given the home crowd reason to let rip with a few Cheltenhamesque roars.Lucas Glover, no relation to Brian, is soaring like a kestrel. He makes a third straight birdie, the latest at No.4, to continue his move up the leaderboard and, at -4, the American is just four off the pace. Talking of birdies, a mighty roar for Graeme McDowell as he plonks his approach from the middle of the 18th fairway to four feet. “I don’t think I got it all, go hard”, shouts G-Mac. The ball listens and he’ll have a short putt to sign for a 69 and post -2 in the clubhouse. That’s currently tied 30th.Still a little frustrating for the neutral that no-one from the pack has infiltrated page one of the leaderboard. American pair Lucas Glover and Patrick Cantlay could be the first to make inroads as both are -3 for the tournament and -2 for the day after back-to-back birdies at 2 and 3. Glover, the 2009 US Open champion, is enjoying his best season for some time while Cantlay recently moved into the world’s top ten after a thrilling win at the Memorial Tournament. He started the final round there four shots behind the leader but won by two thanks to an 8-under 64 so if you’re scribbling notes next to the runners and riders in the current top 20, pencil in “likes a final-day charge” next to Cantlay.Four players shot 6-under 65s in Friday’s second round although, as one of them was Rory McIlroy, only three will get the chance to pull off that most difficult of feats: going low one day and following it up with another good ‘un the next. The three remaining members of the 65 gang are Americans Xander Schauffele and Kevin Streelman, and South African Justin Harding. Streelman is already reeling a little after playing his first eight holes in +2 while Harding and Schauffele, T5 and T18 respectively, are yet to tee off.We’re often spun the line that starting the last 36 holes seven, eight or even nine shots back at an Open is no impossible hurdle, especially given the vagaries of the British weather. The concept of a weekend charge is compelling but, unfortunately, there’s not a great deal of truth in it. Starting from Tom Lehman’s victory at Lytham in 1996 and there are just two examples of winners starting the final two rounds outside the top 15. Francesco Molinari was tied 29th and six back before coming through to win at Carnoustie last year while David Duval sat tied 35th after two days of frustration at Lytham in 2001 before turning on the afterburners and hoisting the Claret Jug. Duval was seven behind at halfway, as was Ernie Els when Red Rum to Adam Scott’s Crisp, again at Lytham in 2012. Outliers offer hope at least and, as I say that, Justin Thomas (currently seven back) pings a tee shot off the first tee. Could he be this year’s weekend charger? Still a wee while before Shane Lowry walks on to the first tee (3:50pm) and ramps up the decibel levels. In the meantime, let’s head to stats corner for some clues on how the Irishman might perform today. There are no guarantees – especially in these unique circumstances – but the good news is that Lowry has a strong record as a front-runner. He’s held the 36-hole leadjoint-lead five times in his EuropeanPGA Tour career and never gone on to finish worse than third from such a position. Twice he converted those leads in to silverware, the first in his famous win as a 5001 amateur in the 2009 Irish Open and the second when going wire-to-wire in this year’s Abu Dhabi Championship. On the other three occasions, he finished just a single shot behind the winner in both the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth and Wales Open in 2014 while he ended two back at this year’s RBC Heritage at Hilton Head in South Carolina after entering the weekend on pole. Yep, he’s made of solid stuff the Irishman. After two days of excellence, there’s good reason to expect continuation not capitulation. Thanks Scott. Walking Netflix box-set series, Doc Redman, and Kiwi Ryan Fox still have the best rounds going today. Both are 3-under for the day, Redman sitting at 3-under for the championship after seven holes of his third lap and Fox -2 overall after 10 holes. Redman is tied 18th and Fox tied 26th but there’s still a sense that we’re watching the support acts before the headliners come on.More essential reading in lieu of serious leaderboard movement. Here’s our man Sean Ingle on how the Open is giving Northern Ireland a good punt up the pound. Clickity click, off you trot. I’m practising what I preach, by the way, because I’m off to read it as well. In the meantime, the loving arms of David Tindall await you. See you again soon!Other than Doc Redman, who is three under for his round through the first six holes, nobody’s making huge inroads today. The wind’s up, and Portrush is a much more testing proposition. But in any conditions, quality will out, and the defending champion Francesco Molinari creams his second at 14 to 12 inches, and makes birdie. That was a sensational approach at the hardest hole on the course. Much as you’d expect for a man who won his Claret Jug at Carnoustie, the toughest test of all. Though he’ll not be matching Tiger Woods and Padraig Harrington as a 21st-century back-to-back winner: he’s +2.Another birdie for Portrush hero Graeme McDowell. He follows up the one he made on 11 with another at the par-five 12th. He’s -1, and must be turning over the tatty denouement to his opening round again and again in his mind. That 5-3-5-7 finish cost him five precious strokes, the difference between simply performing at the weekend, and being right in the mix. Still, look at Darren and Rory, it could be a lot worse.Willebrordus Adrianus Maria Luiten - also known as Joost, to the blessed relief of live bloggers around the world - started out as a ski jumper. But he had a bad fall as a ten-year-old, breaking both elbow and nose, and so transferred his talents toThe Doc is made of the proper stuff. He sends his tee shot at the par-three 6th bounding down a deep swale at the back left of the green. He does pretty well to lob up to 15 feet, though the par putt’s far from certain. But he knocks it in nervelessly. He’s been taking breathing exercises to control the jitters. They seem to be working. He remains at -3, forward momentum brilliantly maintained.In lieu of Weekend Rory Action ... here’s the story of yesterday’s act of doomed heroism.Back-to-back birdies for Kevin Kisner. A textbook no-frills amble up the par-five 2nd and he’s -3. Doc Redman opts not to attack the pin at the big-risk-and-reward 5th he wisely wedges short of the flag, taking the OB behind out of play, and cradles up a putt. Par. He remains at -3 alongside Kisner. And Ryan Fox, who had bogeyed 6 since we last heard of him today, takes the shot back at 8 with a lovely 20-foot right-to-left curler. He’s -1 again.A birdie for G-Mac on 11. He curls a lovely right-to-left 25-footer into the cup. He’s level par now, in credit for his round today, having earlier birdied 2 and bogeyed 6. The home crowd, momentarily stunned by Rory’s doomed comeback and Darren Clarke’s last-gasp capitulation yesterday, find their voice again. Hear them roar.Another long putt sunk by the Doc! Redman rattles it in from 30 feet at 4, and that’s three birdies in a row! He’s -3. Last year’s joint runner-up Kevin Kisner opens with birdie to move immediately to -2. And on 5, with the pin tucked towards the back of the green and the wind whipping towards the sea, Kyle Stanley hits an overly aggressive second that rolls through and out of bounds. No spectators standing there, so at least that’s something. He tries again, wedging to 12 feet. Two putts later, that’s a double bogey, and all his early gains have been lost. He’s level par again.Now then, Doc Redman. Doc’s not a nickname, it’s on his birth certificate. (Dr Golf, a mere fictional confection of the HBH, is beyond jealous.) Redman’s parents were certainly creative his sister is called Karma. Anyway, the 21-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina looks the real deal. He’s been playing since the age of three, golf one of his two passions along with calculus. He’s been known to hit over a thousand putts a day to groove in his stroke how many equations he solves per week isn’t on record. Anyway, Redman shot 62 in a qualifier to reach the recent inaugural Rocket Mortgage Classic, then went on to grab second place and with it a spot in the Open. He’s admitted to suffering from nerves in the past, most notably when he teed it up at the Masters last year, missing the cut, but he’s looking in control this week. Back-to-back birdies this morning at 2 and 3, the latter the reward for a 40-foot tramliner, and he’s -2.Now Stanley does extremely well to get up and down from the bottom of a bank at the par-three 3rd, after a weak tee shot. A decent chip up to 15 feet, then a brilliant putt to scramble. He remains at -2. Meanwhile birdies at 2 for a couple of English stars in Eddie Pepperell and Paul Casey, both men rising to -1. And it’s a fast start by this week’s record breaker, Ryan Fox. The Kiwi played the back nine in 29 strokes on Thursday, the best figures in Open history. Now he’s opened today with birdies at 2 and 5. He’s -1. Just to say, he could go on to birdie 6, 8 and 9, and eagle 5, and even then he’d be a shot shy of Denis Durnian’s front-nine Open record of 28, set at Birkdale in 1983. But one rewriting of the history books is enough, let’s not get greedy.Philosophy corner. Yesterday’s dialectical discourse between Robert MacIntyre and Kyle Stanley - in which the young Scot posited a thesis suggesting it’s advisable to shout “fore!” when you spray a shot towards the gallery, the American reacting with an antithesis of “bugger off”, synthesis as yet unpublished - seems to have lit a fire under the latter. Stanley very nearly makes eagle at 2, but settles for a kick-in birdie that whisks him up to -2. He’s now in a tie for 25th, just six shots off the lead jointly held by JB Holmes and Shane Lowry. It’s a bunched leaderboard all right.But here’s another: Benjamin Hebert birdies 2 to rise to -1 for the championship. The 32-year-old Frenchman - it’s the 20th anniversary of Jean van de Velde’s heroic failure, by the way - is in hot form. He qualified for the Open only last week, after shooing a final round of 62 at the Scottish Open to make a play-off with Bernd Wiesberger. He lost that face-off at the third extra hole, but it meant he was teeing it up at the Open for only the second time. He missed the cut at Birkdale in 2008, shooting 79-73 as an amateur. This time he’s going along very nicely. Throw in the biggest paycheck of his career last week, and it’s been a fine few days for M. Hebert.Birdie for Stanley on 1! Go Kyle! Go Kyle! A lovely 20-footer rolled across the green after a pin-high approach. He moves into red figures at -1. Stanley hasn’t done much in the majors the 31-year-old from Washington state’s best finish is a tie for 21st at this year’s Masters. He’s probably more famous for his maiden PGA Tour victory at the Phoenix Open in 2012, making up eight shots in the final round to win, a week after shipping a six-shot final-round lead of his own at the Farmers Insurance Open. Only in sport, huh. Sadly the aforementioned Tom Lewis follows up his eagle at 2 with bogey at 3, and slips back to level par. So now Stanley is the only one of the morning starters in red figures for this year’s tournament.A warm reception on the first tee for Kyle Stanley. Whether he deserves such blanket respect may be a moot point, given he fired two shots into the gallery yesterday, failing to shout fore on both occasions. His second wild one hit the mother of playing partner Robert MacIntyre’s caddie, leading to a full and frank exchange of views in the scorer’s hut later on. Maybe it was just a momentary lapse of judgement on Stanley’s part we all have off days. Hopefully he’ll learn from it. However, it’s a good sign for Scottish golf, so long in the doldrums, that the 22-year-old prospect from Oban has the nerve to stand his ground with an established pro during his rookie season on Tour.It’s been a long time since Tom Lewis made a name for himself by leading the Open as a 20-year-old amateur. That was 2011, when he shot an opening 65 at Sandwich, the lowest round by an amateur in Open history. It made him the first amateur to lead the Open since the renowned Michael Bonallack managed it back in 1968. One of Lewis’s playing partners that day was the five-time winner Tom Watson, after whom he was named. Lewis finished the week tied 30th as low amateur, the Silver Medal hanging around his neck. Such a shame one won’t be awarded this week, with no amateur making the cut. Anyway, Lewis has since turned pro, with a couple of victories on the European Tour to his name, both at the Portugal Masters, in 2011 and 2018. He’s belatedly delivering on his early promise, with a notable upturn in form during the last couple of years. And he’s eagled 2 this morning, sending a magnificent second shot to four feet, to become the first of the early starters to make it into red figures. He’s -1 for the tournament.While we wait for folk to get properly moving on Moving Day ... here’s a typically illuminating piece from our man Andy Bull on golf in Northern Ireland during more uncertain times.Good morning Ulster. News to follow, but let’s start with the weather. It’s a lovely sunny day on the Antrim coast. The beautiful Dunluce links of Portrush shining in all its glory and splendour. It looks as though the sun will be out for most of the day. Some cloud in the afternoon perhaps. And there’s not a huge likelihood of rain. If we get any, it’ll be later in the afternoon andor early evening, and not particularly heavy. But while Portrush’s defences were totally down yesterday, the conditions still, the breeze is expected to pick up today. Gusts of up to 25mph at some points. As a result, the chances of a repeat of round two’s across-the-board low scoring aren’t super-high. Then again, these are the world’s top golfers we’re talking about. Also, Shane Lowry was out in the worst of yesterday’s weather, and he still went out in 31. So let’s assume nothing. Onward!If the first two days of the 148th Open Championship are anything to go by, the weekend is going to be a heady Portrush rush. Look at the drama we’ve already been served up: a hole-in-one for Emiliano Grillo a nonuple-bogey 14 for David Duval a record-breaking back-nine 29 for Ryan Fox an opening quadruple-bogey for pre-tournament favourite Rory McIlroy, who’d go on to miss a putt from 12 inches on his way to a 79 a 78 for Tiger a triple-bogey capitulation at the 18th that cost local hero Darren Clarke his weekend participation an Irish charge by Shane Lowry the late-career renaissance of Lee Westwood and 65s for Xander Schauffele, Justin Harding and ... Rory McIlroy, who fell one stroke short of a comeback for the ages.And there are still two whole days to go! With so many big names on the shoulder of leaders Shane Lowry and JB Holmes, today won’t just be about moving. The way things have been going, it’ll also feature some grooving, shaking, rattling, rolling, bumping, grinding, twerking, the twist, the hitchhike, the watusi and the mashed potato. The only downside is the lack of a Silver Medal battle, no amateurs having survived the cut. Ah well, we can’t have it all. It’s still on. Moving Day is on. It’s on!Missing the cut (a selection): Jason Day, Brandt Snedeker, Beef, Padraig Harrington, Gary Woodland, Hideki Matsuyama, Kim Si-woo, Zach Johnson, Paul Lawrie, Bryson DeChambeau, Tiger Woods, Ian Poulter, Phil Mickelson, Adam Scott, David Duval (well, y’know) and ... Rory McIlroy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09decefb0e1f4e40fcc4c4590ccdf6cd8c8661d9/0_33_3489_2093/master/3489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b89339021c8669ec3b5a26c578cb7bb","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 14 takes race up to finish on tourmalet live","story":"Here’s a report on today’s stage, which ended with France celebrating both a stage winner and a yellow jersey wearer.Thibaut Pinot is on the podium, collecting a bouquet, waving it abo and looking a bit chuffed.Julian Alaphilippe had never finished in the top 40 of a mountain stage before. Today, powered somehow by the yellow jersey, he came second. Nobody is taking him lightly now.All change in the GC:Nairo Quintana completes the stage, 3min 23sec behind Pinot.Geraint Thomas crosses the line, about 35sec behind the yellow jersey!A brilliant win for Thibaut Pinot, and Alaphilippe comes second! 130m to go: Pinot goes, and can anyone catch him?400m to go: The stage winner will surely come from this group: Alaphilippe, Kruijswik, Bernal, Buchmann, Pinot and Landa.1km to go: Geraint Thomas is left behind! Six riders are at the head of the race, with Alaphilippe among them.1.2km to go: Jakob Fuglsang has also been dropped. Alaphilippe is still looking comfortable.1.5km to go: Thomas has dropped back since last I mentioned him, with Alaphilippe right behind him once again. 2km to go: The camera cuts to Quintana, entirely on his own, nobody anywhere near him, slogging up the hill.3km to go: Gaudu is dragged back innto the pack, and three Jumbo-Visma riders are at the front now. Steven Kruijswijk is perfectly placed. 4km to go: David Gaudu attacks! Where has that come from? He doesn’t get very far, mind.4.5km to go: Geraint Thomas movess up to fifth, and Alaphilippe, who had been marking him, doesn’t immediately respond. He’s still clinging on to the leading group, with one rider behind him.5km to go: Barguil has been caught, and this is anyone’s day.5.5km to go: Richie Porte, 15th in the GC this morning, has also been dropped, we’re told.6km to go: So it looks like the ambitions of Nairo Quintana, Adam Yates and Dan Martin, ninth, 10th and 11th in the GC rankings this morning, to win this race will end today.6.3km to go: Julian Alaphilippe still seems entirely comfortable. He moves up the peloton to sit on the wheel of Geraint Thomas. 7km to go: David Gaudu tries to lead Thibaut Pinot away from the peloton, but they’re not allowed to break free.9.3km to go: Gesbert is hauled in, and Warren Barguil attacks! 9.5km to go: A couple of Movistar riders have been sent back to rescue Quintana.10km to go: Movistar presumably haven’t been pulling the peloton all day for Nairo Quintana: he has now been dropped. On Colombian Independence Day, he’s on his own. 10.5km to go: Andrey Amador, who seems to have been at the head of the peloton for about half the stage, finally drops off the pace. An immense effort from the Costa Rican today.12km to go: Dan Martin, 11th in the GC this morning, is falling away as well. Adam Yates, coincidentally, was 10th.12.5km to go: Patrick Konrad had to change bikes and thus finds himself behind the yellow jersey group, stuck with Adam Yates and his mates. 13km to go: Gesbert is now on his own, 30 seconds ahead of the yellow jersey group, which is still being led by Movistar, with a gaggle of Ineos riders tucked in behind.14km to go: Adam Yates is having a very bad day, and is struggling again with a lot of climbing still to come.15km to go: Elie Gesbert has joined Romain Sicard at the front, 45 seconds ahead of anyone else. 17km to go: The first couple of dozen mentions of Tourmalet in the  all concerned a horse of that name, which apparently did quite a lot of winning in the 1860s. The first mention in a cycling context was in a report on the 1924 race: “...Then come, in the Basque country,, the Justices of the Peace, those calm, inhuman shoulders of the great Pyrenean range Aubisque, Tourmalet, Aspin, which no car can climb without resting to cool, which separate and inexorably classify the racers ... the hardest test humanity has invented for the ultimate strength of legs.”19km to go: Sicard goes through Esquièze-Sère, and from here there is nowhere to go but up.20km to go: Whooosh! Sicard is now 1.30sec ahead of the peloton. Gesbert and Calmejane are about 30sec closer.25km to go: We have a new leader: Romain Sicard has gone on his own! 27km to go: All but two of the Movistar team are in the peloton, helping Nairo Quintana as best they can. 30km to go: The route almost immediately heads uphill, gently at first, towards the Tourmalet. “Just saw a gendarme herding cows to keep them off the road,” writes Gareth Thomas (a while ago, back when there were cows milling about). “Why don’t farmers herd their own cows to keep them safe if they know the TDF is coming through? Happens every year.” They presumably think that if the Tour didn’t want to run the risk of rider-bovine interactions they would make sure the route didn’t go anywhere near their cows.31km to go: Wellens is first to finish the sprint, with the front three about to be caught by a chasing five.33km to go: Sagan might have dropped out of the breakaway but he’s still got some fuel in the tank, and he’s been leading the yellow jersey group as they haul in the remainers. They’re now just 45sec behind the leading trio.34km to go: There is an intermediate sprint to Pierrefitte-Nestalas, with the finish line just a couple of kilometres away now.35km to go: Adam Yates, thanks in no small part to his brother Simon, has been dragged back into the yellow jersey group.38km to go: The leaders pass Argelès-Gazost, home of the Pyrénées Animal Park, apparently very much the place to go if you want to feed a marmot.42km to go: Of that 17-strong breakaway group, only eight remain. The front three (Nibali, Wellens and Gesbert) have a 30-second lead over the other five, with the peloton 1min 15sec back.47km to go: The leaders pass through Aucun. Which, if I’m not mistaken, is a town called None. 49km to go: The riders descend at wild pace. Here is the confirmed points distribution from that category four climb:52km to go: The next 25km or so are mainly descent, before the big stage-concluding climb. 55km to go: I haven’t really mentioned Julian Alaphilippe, but he’s looking fairly comfortable in the peloton. 56km to go: Nibali tries to stick with Wellens, and fails. Another 10 points for the polka-dot jersey wearer.56.5km to go: It’s Wellens and Nibali, side by side with 400m to go.57km to go: The leaders are just 1km from the top of the climb, but behind them the peloton, still being dragged uphill by Movistar, is on the hunt. They are just 1min 23sec behind now.58km to go: There are a lot of cows grazing on the edge of the road. One of them has to be shepherded away by spectators to prevent a potentially horrific if milky pile-up.58km to go: Three go alone at the front, looking for the points at the top of the climb. Nibali, Wellens and Gesbert are the leading trio.59km to go: 2.5km of climbing still ahead of the leaders.

Important to note that in the canon of blockbuster standup comedians accused of sexual impropriety, Aziz Ansari (Aziz Ansari: Right Now on Netflix, right … right now) does better than Louis CK – whose comeback shows were, as best I can tell, just half an hour of going: “What’s the deal with chicks who don’t like being masturbated at down the telephone?” There is a sombre, show-opening statement about the accusations made against him on babe.net last year, how they affected him and the conversations they started. It’s not perfect – and it’s not a whole apology – but it does at least acknowledge the elephant in the room, without shooting it to death with a high-calibre rifle. The conversation around Ansari is complex, but a public statement of remorse is a pretty good start on rehabilitating his image and career.Right, now that’s out of the way: I simply hate every production decision made around this standup special. Spike Jonze directs, for some reason, which means the camera lurches and half-zooms around like a 90s skate vid (you keep expecting someone to grind along a pavement before a supercut of a lad with a leather thong necklace exploding his testicles on a concrete staircase railing). The whole thing is faux-graded like an old VHS (Annoying. Annoying!) and the majority of the show is tight on Ansari, Jonze often standing next to him, visible in frame, before shots of one of the most “Brooklyn” crowds ever committed to tape smiling along in the background.We’re here to have a laugh, though, aren’t we? And, after a juddering start, a glimmer of the old Ansari swings back into view: he is, after all, an agile, wide-eyed comedian, adept at noticing the worst facets of the human condition and pulling them into the light without resorting to meanness. He plays with pace, shying back into a low, whispering, apologetic tone (too quiet, often: keep the remote near you while you’re watching this because the sound levels are all over the place. Annoying!) before booming back with a punchline. Ansari takes on woke culture without resorting to a tedious old-man-yells-at-cloud shtick he muses on race, modern love, the death of everyone’s parents he takes on R Kelly and Michael Jackson in a your-scandal-was-bigger-than-mine sort of way there’s a pleasingly spicy joke about Osama bin Laden recording a feted jazz album.The whole aesthetic is lo-fi – Ansari has lost the sculpted stubble and slick dressing of Master of None, instead opting for a T-shirt and clean-shaven-with-long-sideburns look last seen in the wild on me, first day of university, circa 2005 – and it all feels deliberate: a humbled aesthetic for a humbled man. “I saw the world where I don’t ever get to do this again,” he tells the audience at the end, thanking them for coming out and giving him a second chance. “And it almost felt like I died. And in a way, I did. That old Aziz who said – ‘Oh, treat yo’self, whatever!’ – he’s dead.”It’s not the Aziz of old – I mean how much mileage was really left in renaming foodstuffs and publicly bullying his cousin? – but the quieter, more contrite Ansari 2.0 still has plenty left to say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9f3f6210d41a185b450a771b0fce185d07647e/0_14_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=858fd4133d5649a9e39b40e8da3be723","title":"hawaii mauna kea thirty meter telescope","story":"Officials in Hawaii said on Friday they will not call up additional national guard troops or use force on peaceful protesters blocking access to the state’s highest peak.Friday was the fifth day of protests at Mauna Kea in response to closing the road to the summit so construction equipment for the Thirty Meter Telescope, a major new international astronomy project, can be taken up. No trucks have made the trip.The Thirty Meter Telescope obtained permits to build after a decade-long review. Last year the Hawaii supreme court ruled the permits were obtained legally.There have been protests in other parts of Hawaii, including on Maui and at the state capitol in Honolulu.Hawaii governor David Ige said his priority was to keep everyone in the community safe, including the activists. The 80 guard members who have been on the Big Island since the start of the protests will remain, state officials said.The governor said last week that national guard units would be used to transport personnel and equipment as well as to enforce road closures. Ige said on Friday no more troops would be called in to the Big Island, but stopped short of removing an emergency proclamation he enacted on Wednesday. The emergency order broadened state authority to remove protesters, including the use of national guard troops.Big Island mayor Harry Kim, who met Ige on Friday morning as about 800 to 1,200 activists gathered on the mountain, said he hoped the protesters and state officials would take some time to discuss a better way forward.“We all need to step back a little bit,” Kim said. “This is still our home, this is still our family. On both sides.”Some notable politicians weighed in. Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard followed fellow Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders in supporting protesters. Gabbard said in a statement Ige should withdraw the emergency declaration and sit down with protesters.“Trust must be earned – it is wrong that state leaders have approved the development of a new telescope on a new site on Mauna Kea, without first ensuring the timely removal of decommissioned facilities along with full restoration of those sites,” Gabbard said.“This failure and a history of broken promises has resulted in the standoff that we are seeing today.”Earlier in the day, Sanders said in a tweet since deleted: “We must guarantee native people’s right to self-determination and their right to protest. I stand with Native Hawaiians who are peacefully demonstrating to protect their sacred mountain of Mauna Kea.”Sanders’ campaign did not immediately respond to an email asking why the tweet was deleted.Protest leader Kaho’okahi Kanuha said protesters have been bracing for law enforcement to show up in force ever since Ige signed the emergency proclamation. That was the day officers arrested 34 protesters.Lieutenant governor Josh Green said he planned to meet with people about the issue.“I believe that this struggle is more about the heart of Hawaii and our sense of self and dignity, especially for the Hawaiian people, than it is about a telescope. It is about cultural recognition and people’s self worth,” he said in a Facebook post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d769d25288ceaa23c275bb87d96b73c5a0e98fe/0_160_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c466fbadd311e7643c390c7872762c01","title":"uk first climate assembly camden draws up wishlist for council action","story":"Camden council officials say they intend to implement at least some of the panel’s ideasBritain’s first climate “citizens assembly” opened its final session on Saturday morning at which more than 50 Londoners will decide on carbon-cutting measures they want their district to enact in order to confront climate change.Camden’s Citizens Assembly, convened to interrogate what locals, neighbourhoods and the council can do for the environment, is deliberating action that would reduce fossil fuel usage in homes and public buildings and on roads.The wishlist will be considered by the council as it draws up an environment action plan for 2020. The outcome of the assembly will be closely watched by other councils planning to follow suit this year, and by Westminster which will hold its own national climate assembly in the autumn.Council officials say there is a clear intention to implement at least some of the recommendations. “I hope there will be some concrete action that we can take forward as a council,” said Georgia Gould, the council leader. “That’s the idea of it being an open process – you are letting go of that control. Our climate is in a crisis and we need to act in radical new ways and this assembly is part of developing those new ideas.”Ideas being considered include community energy projects such as solar panels on schools, GP surgeries and public buildings, a revolution in heating buildings that favours air source heat pumps over old-style gas boilers, better insulation and urban greening.“I’m keen that they should ban all cars. They should ban all gas boilers in newbuilds now. They should retrofit old buildings,” said Rupert Cruise, one of the participants.By the end of Saturday’s deliberations, participants will have spent 12 hours in three separate sessions listening to briefings, asking questions, debating with each other and coming up with solutions.They were recruited randomly via a street and door-knocking campaign. A shortlist was winnowed down to assure the final composition was demographically (but not necessarily politically) representative. The participants are being paid £150 in vouchers for their time.Some participants said that although they were keen to do something, they felt the real scope for action lay with the national government. After all, aircraft do not take off in Camden, there are no large power plants, and container ships do not pass through.“Most people are informed and there is consensus, but people feel that iniduals can’t do much,” said Khalil Miah. “It’s up to national government to set the goalposts and the deadlines.”Others said the process itself was a breath of fresh air, helping to address not just the crisis in the environment but the crisis in democracy too.“It is absolutely great,” said Merve Öner, a student on the assembly. “It’s a erse community and it’s delightful to involve them all. I think it should be implemented in lots of other countries.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00b95ba248a4364bf2f3b447ad5d44aebadf7d5f/911_800_2537_1522/master/2537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb174cc1a91bc1e831ec8ede10edcad","title":"benjamin netanyahu becomes longest serving israeli pm","story":"‘King Bibi’ beats David Ben-Gurion’s record, but with threatening clouds on the horizonBenjamin Netanyahu has become Israel‘s longest-serving prime minister, snatching the title from the country’s founding father and first leader, David Ben-Gurion.As of Saturday, the man referred to as King Bibi by both those who adore and detest him, has spent 4,867 days – more than 13 years – in office.During the past two decades, the now-69-year-old former commando has repeatedly won elections on promises of making Israel secure and prosperous, while sidelining the Palestinians.“He has convinced many voters that he is irreplaceable,” said Gideon Rahat, a political science professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute.Despite passing the historic milestone, Netanyahu still needs to win a September election and survive three impending corruption cases to continue his long tenure.His supporters claim Israel has never been richer, safer or more globally accepted, including by leaders of Arab states. Critics argue he has opened fissures in Israeli society, stigmatised minorities to win elections, crushed progressive and human rights activism and encouraged the rise of far-right politics into government.In the latest election in April, he was accused of appealing to racist voters when he stated Israel was “not a state of all its citizens”, referring to the country’s minority population of Palestinian citizens. Netanyahu later made an election pact with a group of far-right extremists called Jewish Power.In his party, the rightwing Likud, Netanyahu has remained at the top, even when it appeared scandals and crises might take him down.“He is very talented at not letting any challenger grow within his party. Any person that looked even close to being popular was somehow kicked out or neutralised,” Rahat said. “Nobody was seen as a replacement for him.”In 1996, Netanyahu became Israel’s youngest prime minister, running on a platform against flailing peace attempts, especially the Oslo accords that gave some limited autonomy to the Palestinians.Under his leadership, control over Palestinian life has become entrenched. The military occupation of the West Bank is tightly managed, while Jewish settlement construction has spread, giving Netanyahu support from hawkish and pro-settler sections of society.Orit Galili-Zucker, a political communications adviser who has worked with Netanyahu, said the prime minister had since made “no courageous decision on the Israeli-Arab conflict. Israel remained stuck and he personally profited from his zero progress.”Netanyahu had also managed to stay in power for so long, she said, by not embarking on grand military campaigns that resulted in large numbers of Israeli casualties, such as the 2006 Lebanon war headed by his predecessor, Ehud Olmert.And as a man who made his break in politics as an affable English-speaking Israeli diplomat, he had excelled, she said, in campaigning and using TV and social media to rally support.Yet Netanyahu could see his extraordinary run in power cut short before the end of the year.One month after appearing to win the election, he failed to form a coalition government. Rather than risk losing the premiership to another contender, he chose to push parliament to disband and force another national vote. Fresh polls are set for 17 September, the first time the country has held two elections in one year.Famed for 11th-hour brinkmanship and daring political gambits, many expect Netanyahu to win. But even then, he faces possibly the biggest challenge of his political career to date: the prospect of three corruption indictments.Just weeks after the election, he will be called to a pre-trial hearing. Israel’s attorney general has already recommended he be indicted.One case involves allegations of receiving gifts, including cigars and champagne from international billionaires, allegedly in exchange for favours. In another, Netanyahu was accused of colluding with the country’s top-selling newspaper to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage.A third case involves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on a news website it owns.Netanyahu has denied all accusations, dismissing them as a witch-hunt orchestrated by the media. He is not legally required to step down unless he is convicted and all his appeals are rejected."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee4043dbb1d90215db01d4d32232a3936b714861/0_126_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be49a99f2d8d7aaed99e2c54233594db","title":"erdogan lonely path to ruin turkey simon tisdall","story":"For a reputed “strongman”, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seems unusually nervous these days. A bombastic speech last week marking the third anniversary of a failed military putsch could not conceal his insecurity. He says he is using his sweeping powers as executive president to build a “new Turkey”. But it appears the old one is tiring of him fast.“The 15th of July was an attempt to subject our nation to slavery,” Erdoğan declared. “But as much as we will never stop protecting our freedom and our future, those who lay traps for us will never cease their efforts.” It was a typical pitch, blending nationalism with scare stories of secret foes, foreign and domestic.Erdoğan remains convinced his enemies are out to get him – and in the manner of all dictators, conflates his personal prospects with those of the state. The latest villains in this self-centred drama are the country’s American and European allies who, as he tells it, seek to subjugate both him and the proudly rising Turkish nation. But freedom is a fungible concept in Erdoğan’s Turkey. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters have been jailed pending trial since 2016. More than 100,000 public sector workers have been suspended or sacked. Another purge preceded the coup anniversary, with more than 200 military personnel and civilians accused of treason.Particular concern is focused on Turkey’s justice system. Britain’s Law Society, citing the “widespread and systematic persecution of members of the legal profession”, has reported Turkey to the UN human rights council. Journalists have suffered similar intimidation. Most Turkish media now tamely toe the government line.Erdoğan has good cause to worry – but the real reason may be simpler: he has made a dreadful hash of things. During 16 consecutive years in power, Turkey’s modern caliph has driven the economy into chronic debt, played regional power-broker with chaotic results, and scapegoated the Kurds for his failures. Now the bill is coming due.Turkey remains in recession following last year’s calamitous currency crisis, amid fears a new financial crunch is imminent. Unemployment and inflation are high and business is slack. Erdoğan’s sacking last week of the central bank governor was seen as a sign he will persist with his discredited strategy of spurring growth with borrowed money.For the first time in years, his political grip is threatened. Erdoğan’s ruling AKP suffered local election losses in five of the six largest cities in March. He was humiliated again last month in Istanbul’s re-run mayoral election. And his monopoly on power makes it harder to shift responsibility to others.External affairs is another disaster area. Scoring a spectacular double last week, Erdoğan fell out with both the US and the EU in the space of a few days. In Washington’s case, the row was over Nato member Turkey’s decision to buy a Russian ground-to-air missile system. Some analysts suggest Erdoğan wanted to demonstrate Turkey’s independence. Others put it down to paranoia. He reportedly still suspects Washington of tacitly supporting the coup and protecting its US-based alleged leader, Fethullah Gülen. Whatever his motives, the missile purchase led the US to cancel a sale of F-35 jets and threaten more sanctions. The cost to the Turkish defence industry, which would have made some aircraft components, is put at $9bn. Bigger still, potentially, is the cost to Nato. The foreign ministry in Ankara warned on Wednesday of “irreparable damage”.Erdoğan’s always tense relations with the EU, strained by the Syrian refugee crisis, underwent a simultaneous rupture. After Ankara ignored Cypriot warnings not to drill for oil and gas in eastern Mediterranean waters that Nicosia claims as its own, EU foreign ministers imposed yet more sanctions. On this analysis, Erdoğan’s cosying up to Russia’s Vladimir Putin puts the US on notice that Turkey has strategic alternatives. It could help the economy, which needs Russian trade and tourism. And it suits Ankara’s policy in Syria where, despite being on opposite sides, Turkey has collaborated with Russia and Iran.Russia and Syria aim to finally bring the civil war to an end by storming the last rebel areas. Erdoğan’s aim is to extend Turkish-controlled “safe areas” eastwards along the Turkey-Syria border in order to hold Kurdish “terrorists” at bay – and prevent another refugee exodus. These aims look increasingly incompatible.At odds with the US, Europe, his Arab neighbours and potentially Russia, too, and increasingly unpopular at home, no-mates Erdoğan is treading a lonely, destructive path towards a strategic and political dead end. The looming question is whether he will take Turkey down with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed3bf38612863b29c9be79787086f2e7d980dd69/0_90_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=121b6a34917e1dd9f08aa7ff8d9bc1c8","title":"japan love mass radio exercise rajio taiso","story":"“One, two, three, four … five, six, seven, eight …” That is the cue for half a dozen people braving a humid morning at Kamezuka park in Tokyo to bend, stretch, jump, and run on the spot. The group’s personal trainer is a portable radio perched on the top of a children’s slide. A male voice’s simple instructions, issued to a jaunty piano accompaniment, has become a staple of daily life in Japan since the broadcasts, known as rajio taisō (radio calisthenics), first hit the airwaves almost a century ago.The three-minute routine is the perfect way to start the day, says Yukihide Maruyama, a 79-year-old retired businessman who has performed the routine nearly every day for a decade. “The exercises aren’t that difficult and afterwards you feel like your body has properly woken up.”Japan’s communal exercise regime has barely changed since the health insurance bureau of the post office, inspired by morning exercises broadcast by the US insurance firm politan Life, launched rajio taisō in November 1928 to celebrate Emperor Hirohito’s formal ascension to the chrysanthemum throne.Today, as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, Japan’s calisthenics community is hoping to raise interest in rajio taisō, with a mass workout at the end of this month involving 10 million people in every one of the country’s 47 prefectures, including 12,000 inside the Games’ main stadium.After Japan’s defeat in the second world war, allied forces banned rajio taisō because of its close association with militarism. But in 1951, the education and health ministries enlisted experts and the life insurance industry to devise a new programme, to be broadcast on NHK public radio.In 2003, the most recent year for which data is available, 27 million people said they took part in morning calisthenics more than twice a week, whether at work, at home in front of the TV or with neighbours in the local park. Children perform rajio taisō before school sports days or during special summer holiday sessions, earning credits that can be exchanged for snacks, stationery and other gifts.Regular participants cover a broad cross-section of Japanese society: construction, factory and office workers, including the 10,000 employees of the Tokyo metropolitan government, who are encouraged to leave their desks and start moving at 3pm every weekday.NHK radio broadcasts the routine four times a day – starting at 6:30am, except Sunday, while the TV version airs three times a day, except at weekends.There are two standard routines – the second slightly more challenging than the first – each involving arm rotations, forward bends, straddle jumps and other aerobic exercises designed to move every muscle and leave participants slightly out of breath. In 1999, a routine was added for people who use wheelchairs or have other mobility issues.“Studies show that people who exercise this way for just a few minutes a day have improved bone density, reduced risk of suffering a stroke or heart attack, and are generally in better physical shape than other people their age who don’t exercise,” says Yasuo Fukushi, secretary general of the Japan Radio Taiso Federation.“There has never been any pressure to modernise the programme, because people have grown up with it and know it off by heart,” adds Fukushi, who believes the routine helps explain the impressive life expectancy of Japanese people.“We even do this when it rains,” says Tomomi Okamoto, a company director who joins the Kamezuka park sessions in all weathers. “It gets the blood pumping and I always feel much better afterwards. It’s a great way to start the day,” she says. “But it’s not just about the exercise – it’s a way of communicating with your neighbours and getting to know people.”Rajio taisō has gained a following in Brazil, Peru and other countries with large Japanese communities, and is behind a recent push in Britain to encourage older people to take more exercise amid warnings that, if left unaddressed, years of physical inactivity could cost the NHS at least £1.3bn in real terms between now and 2030.In April, Sport England, in collaboration with the thinktank Demos, and Anchor Hanover, a care and housing provider for older people, launched 10 Today – a Lottery-funded six-month pilot programme that features 10-minute exercise programmes broadcast online and on two community radio stations three times a week.“There is evidence that physically active older adults have lower rates of all-cause mortality, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and colon and breast cancer compared with more inactive adults,” the report said.The Kamezuka park regulars have finished their workout and, invigorated by their burst of activity, vow to return tomorrow. “Most of us are getting on, and it can be hard going on a cold, dark morning, but for some reason we all keep turning up,” says Maruyama, who has barely broken a sweat. “And I’d say we’re all in pretty good shape.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78c36d006fef59185b36f65c94e33774af20c6f/304_360_842_505/master/842.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d06b8e576adcdae0693c361fa616af73","title":"yang hengjun china tells australia to stop interfering in writers detention","story":"Beijing attacks ‘irresponsible remarks’ of Marise Payne and says it is conducting a lawful inquiry into case of Australian academicChina has told Australia to stop interfering in the investigation of Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun and to stop issuing “irresponsible remarks”.The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, said on Friday the federal government was “deeply disappointed” that Yang had been transferred to criminal detention in China, saying he should be released if he was being held “for his political views”. Payne was seeking clarification over the reasons for his detention.A spokesman for China’s foreign ministry said Beijing was carrying out a lawful investigation.“China’s deplores the statement made by the Australian foreign minister and urges the Australian side not to interfere in China’s lawful handling of the case in any way and stop issuing irresponsible remarks,” he said.A Chinese public intellectual who has long advocated for democratic reforms in China, Yang has been detained since January in an unknown location in China on suspicion of endangering national security.The 53-year-old, who has held Australian citizenship since 2002 and has a doctorate from the University of Technology Sydney, had been living in New York as a visiting scholar at Columbia University.Australian officials have visited Yang in detention six times, most recently on 27 June.Payne said that despite writing twice to her Chinese counterpart asking for a fair and transparent resolution and for Yang to be allowed to see his lawyers, that had not happened.“We expect basic standards of justice and procedural fairness to be met.”Friends and family of Yang expect him to be charged with endangering state security.His Australian lawyer, Rob Stary, said a political intervention was the only likely means by which to resolve the issue.He said Australia should use its special relationship with China to secure Yang’s release.Yang’s wife, Yuan Xiaoliang, a permanent resident of Australia, has been banned from leaving China.The Law Council of Australia said it strongly supported Payne’s remarks and that intervention in this “very troubling matter”.“The Law Council remains concerned that Dr Yang does not appear to have the benefit of any of the traditional safeguards expected of an independent criminal justice system and the rule of law,” it said on Saturday.This included access to a lawyer of his choice, the right for the public to know what he is being detained for and when it is expected that he will be released."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3962865.1563625682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cloudy weekend to give way to temperatures of up to 28 degrees next week","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Oliver and Harry Barnes pictured at Seapoint, Dublin, enjoying the sunshine last weekend.

We go back to to the original owner, if we can take a prosecution for failure to notify, we do so.“But from a moral point of view, absolutely, greyhounds should not be exported to countries that do not have good welfare standards.”Mr Dollard disputed figures in a report — commissioned by the IGB itself — that suggested thousands of greyhounds are culled in Ireland every year because of over-breeding.The analysis carried out by consultants Preferred Results Ltd was revealed in an RTÉ Investigates programme which has created the recent controversy.Despite praising the consultants in a letter written in June last year for being “rigorous, thorough and professional” in carrying out their report, Mr Dollard said on Saturday that its figures were “based on guesstimates, estimates and assumptions”.“There are a lot of figures thrown around in relation to unaccounted for dogs,” he said.“That is not correct.”Mr Dollard said he was not dismissing the report and not in any way suggesting that Preferred Results was not professional, thorough and rigorous but that “because there isn’t a traceability system for greyhounds nobody can at this point in time account for all greyhounds.”The IGB chief executive also defended early-morning greyhound races — run for online betting — saying some dogs “actually prefer to run earlier in the morning, rather than late in the evening.”“So, I think it is natural evolution and I don’t think it in any way diminishes how the greyhound is being treated to have an early morning race meeting,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3961849.1563576290!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"london irish loneliness in a pub no one would talk to you","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe London Irish Centre in Camden, established in 1954, helps to tackle isolation. Photograph:  Daniel KeaneIn 1957, aged 23, Thomas Mulligan left his home in Lucan, Co Dublin, for England, to find work and a better life. By the end of the decade, he had become one of nearly 60,000 Irish who had made the journey.Mulligan’s story is a familiar one. He found work as a plasterer, before setting up his own business and settling down in north London with a family of five. Though it is home, London often feels like a lonely place for him, he says.“In London, you could stand in a pub all night and no one would talk to you. In Ireland, everyone would talk to you,” says Mulligan, who visits the London Irish Centre in Camden three times a week.He says it’s “a good place even just to meet people for the craic”. Mulligan lives alone but has regular visits from his family, and charities and support groups are a vital presence in his life.He had spent his last months in a care home in Greenford in west London. Unlike Mulligan, Lynch had no one in his circle. For many, it is a stark reminder that some slip through the cracks. Sometimes, the reasons are complicated.“The pubs and churches served as social support systems. There’s nothing to go to now,” especially as the Irish population has been getting older, Danny Maher says. Maher runs a homeless charity called Ashford Place. “It has created the sense of a loss of identity and the loss of our role in society, because all of these iconic places that were part of our identity have gone.”The older generation of Irish emigrants have fewer connections with their younger counterparts than in the past, he says, because pubs and clubs “have faded in popularity and importance”.New IrishYounger Irish emigrants are more likely to meet through social media than at the local Irish pub. Inter-generational socialising, so common in Ireland, is rarely found in London’s Irish community.“I saw a headline in the Irish Post a couple of years ago saying ‘Clapham is the new Cricklewood’. What that said very clearly is that the new Irish generation goes to Clapham now, not Cricklewood,” Maher says.Based in Cricklewood, Ashford Place offers accommodation to the homeless, helps some people to resettle back to Ireland, often after decades abroad, and runs a variety of community programmes.The links between loneliness and isolation are self-evident, Maher says: “We must not allow the reality of these changes in the community to cause a rise in levels of street homelessness or feelings of isolation in the community.”The number of Irish rough sleepers in London has fallen by 40 per cent over the last five years, but this has only been possible on the back of tireless work by institutions such as Ashford Place and other Irish charities.Despite the influx of new Irish after Ireland’s economic crash in 2008, the Irish population in the UK is rapidly ageing, and more likely to live alone. In 2011, the UK census showed that a fifth of Irish 65-year-olds live alone, the highest of any other ethnic group in the UK.In 2001, the Irish were the largest foreign-born group in the UK, still bolstered by the hundreds of thousands who had moved there in the 1950s and 1980s.Since then, as the 1950s generation has aged and died, the Irish-born population has shrunk by almost a quarter, overtaken by Poles, Indians, Pakistanis and Romanians.Lack of fundingIn the most recent census in 2011, 430,309 people living in Britain identified themselves as Irish-born, down 37 per cent from a peak of 683,000 in 1961. The Annual Population Survey carried out by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) in 2018 put the Irish-born population for the UK at just 380,000.The London Irish Centre in Camden, established in 1954, offers a range of services such as befriending groups, hardship grants and welfare advice. These service help to tackle isolation, says Brian Hanley who is the centre’s director of community services.“As people get older, they want a sense of familiarity and background. They want to meet people who understand their culture. But these services don’t have the resources to look at the more culturally-sensitive aspects of care and support,” he says.Cuts in public spending made by the Conservatives since 2010 have gradually eroded care services to “the bare minimum”, says Hanley.“It’s difficult to get the basic support for people. The lack of funding does make it a struggle for groups like us to make ends meet, but it’s essential that these culturally-sensitive services are funded.”News, features, interviews and personal stories by and about the Irish around the world"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3962864.1563628276!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk summons iranian diplomat following seizure of oil tanker","story":"The British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero, which was seized by the Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on Friday, is photographed in the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday.

Photograph: Tasnim News Agencyvia AP The UK’s foreign office has summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires following the seizure of a British-flagged oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz.It comes as Iran directly linked the seizure of the tanker with Britain’s role in detaining a tanker carrying Iranian oil earlier this month.A spokesman for Iran’s  Council was quoted as saying “the rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law” and that Tehran made the right decision in the face of an “illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers”.The explanation, which contrasts with a suggestion on Friday night that the Stena Impero was “violating international maritime rules” and had collided with a fishing boat, came as the UK government warned British ships to stay away from the Strait of Hormuz and described the seizure of the UK registered vessel as “unacceptable”.HMS Montrose, which is patrolling the Persian Gulf to protect shipping and earlier this month intercepted Iranian patrol boats surrounding another UK-flagged tanker, reportedly arrived minutes too late to prevent the latest incident.Stena Bulk, which owns the Stena Impero, said the ship was in “full compliance with all navigation and international regulations” when it was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.A second oil tanker, the Liberian-flagged Mesdar, which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK, veered off course towards the Iranian coast after it was boarded by armed guards at around 5.30pm on Friday.The Mesdar’s Glasgow-based operator said communication had since been re-established with the ship and the crew were unharmed. The tanker was reportedly allowed to resume navigation.The UK government’s emergency committee Cobra met on Friday night and ministers were expected to discuss the crisis further on Saturday.Downing Street said prime minister Theresa May was in her constituency but was being kept informed of developments.After the Cobra meeting, a UK government spokesman said the seizure was “a clear challenge to international freedom of navigation”, adding: “As the foreign secretary has said, our response will be considered and robust and there will be serious consequences if the situation is not resolved.”Former chief of defence staff Lord Richards said Britain was “pretty limited” in what military action it could take without the support of allies such as America, should economic sanctions fail to resolve the situation.But foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had spoken to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo about the situation and president Donald Trump said America would be “working with the UK”.He told reporters: “We will talk to the UK and we have no written agreement but we have an agreement. They’ve been a very great ally of ours.”France and Germany joined condemnation of Iran’s actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK.Fears had been growing that the Iranian authorities were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the seizure of the Grace 1 tanker off the coast of Gibraltar on July 4 in an operation involving Royal Marines.The Grace 1 was suspected of violating EU sanctions by carrying a cargo of Iranian oil destined for Syria in breach of sanctions and Mr Hunt later offered to help release the vessel if Iran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assad’s regime.But Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the tanker’s seizure an act of “piracy” on Tuesday and warned the UK to expect a response.A statement from Stena Bulk said ship manager Northern Marine Management had lost contact with the crew of 23 after “unidentified small crafts and a helicopter” approached the vessel at about 4pm on Friday.The company said the tanker was in international waters at the time but appeared to be heading north towards Iran.Erik Hanell, president and chief executive of Stena Bulk, said: “There are 23 seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.“There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.

In its most recent annual report, it disclosed that talent pay rose by £11 million last year.“There should be a register of interests so the public can see what they are doing,” Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told the Daily Mail.The firm in question, Henley \u0026amp Partners is accused of inadvertently helping criminals to escape justice through offering a golden ticket into other countries.It runs a number of “citizenship by investment” programmes through which the firm helps its wealthy clients to purchase citizenship in countries such as Malta and Austria.The European Council warned in January this year that so-called “golden passport” schemes create risks to security. money laundering, corruption and tax-evasion for its member states.Henley \u0026amp Partners denies all allegations of lawbreaking and claims that all its applicants “undergo the strictest due diligence procedures”.A spokesman: \u0027Over the past 20 years, Henley \u0026amp Partners has invested significant time and capital in creating a corporate structure that is wedded to best practice governance and the highest levels of due diligence, even before passing a client over to the consideration of a sovereign state.\u0027  BBC takes a gamble on Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials, the \u0026#34most expensive British drama ever made\u0026#34 French detectives investigate disappearance of 700 artworks and furnishings from presidential residences British warship was an hour from tanker seized by Iran in \u0026#39hostile act\u0026#39Europe and US brace for extreme temperatures as heatwave returnsGordon Ramsay: roasted guinea pig is \u0026#34delicious\u0026#34 but I won\u0026#39t put it on the menuComment: The \u0026#39go home\u0026#39 scandal shows just how far Trump has strayed from the Republican Party of ReaganComment: Brexit myopia and a fatal lack of foresight has enabled Iran to put Britain on the spotRomanian man appears in court charged with the murder of a grandmother Valerie Graves Winged hares, stuffed pigs and decorative penises: how to party like a PompeianComment: The right to disagree passionately over Brexit is what makes Britain a free countryPolice hunt two men in London after Tube tear gas attackGame of Thrones star calls criticism of show\u0026#39s final season a \u0026#39media-led hate campaign\u0026#39A Night in with Bros, review: sweet, rambling, and best watched with a bottle of wineComment: The failure to stand up for conservative thinking is leading us into a new cultural dark ageComment: The only surprise about Iran\u0026#39s seizure of the British oil tanker is that it didn\u0026#39t happen soonerWhat Boris Johnson will do in his first 24 hours as Prime MinisterComment: Why Brexit could save us from technotyranny and our own extinctionDispatch: South African army struggle to contain gang war driven by deprivation and bitter legacy of apartheidIran crisis: British oil tanker seized in Strait of Hormuz as UK shipping warned to avoid area in GulfWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2019/07/15/TELEMMGLPICT000146990783_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"brexit could save us technotyranny extinction","story":"The philosophy of Brexit is about so much more than BrexitHumans are screwed if they can\u0027t come up with a less despotic vision of \u0027progress\u0027 The coming tyranny creeps as well as flaunts.

France and the Baltic region saw a spike in drownings as crowds flocked to rivers and lakes to cool down. In the United States, this week’s extreme heat could potentially break records and claim lives as temperatures rise rapidly along the East Coast through to the Midwest. In New York City on Friday, mayor Bill de Blasio declared a “local emergency due to extreme heat”, opening 500 cooling centres for residents to escape the weather. Saturday is going to be really, really bad, on through Sunday, Mr de Blasio said in a warning to the city. Take care of yourself, don\u0027t go out in the heat if you don\u0027t need to...

touched the Moon 50 years ago – completing a mission that is perhaps the most ambitious and great achievement of mankind.The mission united the world as it watched, but also resulted from discord that split it in two. And it remains so unbelievable in part because it was also the end of the most significant part of the space race, with space travel soon after never ascending to such heights or levels of interest again.Here is the facts about that Apollo 11 Moon landing, including when and how humanity managed such an accomplishment – as well as why.The three astronauts in Apollo 11 set off on 16 July, 1969. After flying for three days, they entered lunar orbit, and on 20 July, Neil Armstrong stepped out of the lander and became the first person to ever walk on the Moon.After more than eight days in space, they dropped down on Earth and were hailed as heroes.Created with Sketch.

No human has ventured there – or even outside of low-Earth orbit – since.With great difficulty. Which in turn was overcome by hard work and ingenuity, as part of\u0026nbspthe culmination of thousands of years of human curiosity.Why some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThe Moon is, obviously, a long way away: about 250,000 miles. And getting there also means leaving Earth’s powerful gravity, which is just as difficult, pulling anything down and requiring vast power.That power came in the form of the Saturn V rocket, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever made, and arguably the most mighty piece of machinery that humanity has ever put together.On top sat the three astronauts, in a much smaller capsule. The rocket carried the astronauts up into space, but it was this capsule that would carry them to the Moon and back, once they had managed to escape Earth.That capsule, known as the command service module, was actually made up of three parts: the command module, that served as the astronauts’\u0026nbsphome through the mission, the service module that contained the bits that powered them through space and kept them alive, and the lunar module.It was only that latter part that ever made its way to the Moon’s surface, after detaching from the rest and touching down on the ground. After Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had explored the Moon, they climbed back into the ascent stage part of that lunar module and used it to fly back up and attach to the main craft, which was being piloted by their colleague Michael Collins.They would then gradually float back to Earth, crashing down to land and completing their mission successfully.There was never any one justification for heading to the Moon. And many people thought we should head there for no reason at all – just because we can, and therefore should.But there was another pressing reason: because other people could. The Moon landing was the crescendo of the Space Race, which had seen the US battle with the Soviet space programme to get to a range of different milestones.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionWhy some people still believe that we never went to the MoonThat didn’t start with the Moon. Both countries – embroiled at the same time in the Cold War – flung rockets, satellites, animals and people into space to demonstrate their power, and putting a man on the Moon became the inevitable conclusion of that work.All of those various aims and desires came wrapped together in a speech given by John F Kennedy in 1961, which helped launch the race for the Moon and set down the reasons for doing so.“I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth,” he said.\u0026nbsp”No single space project in this period will be more exciting, or more impressive, or more important for the long-range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.”Getting there helped improve science in myriad ways. A variety of breakthroughs came as a result of the work done to get humanity to the Moon, and when the astronauts touched down they also helped with scientific work in unprecedented ways – they gathered up Moon rocks, left behind sensors, and even the ways that their bodies responded to the stress and strangeness of space was studied to give information that is still being studied to this day.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was a miracle, and one made so powerful because it was so very unlikely.It was hailed as an incredible success.\u0026nbspBut the chance of failure was such that authorities had to prepare for the possibility of losing the astronauts.Those preparations offer a humbling insight into how risky that mission was, and how high the stakes were.Probably the most potent document from those preparations is the speech that would have been used to hail the bravery of the astronauts as they were left to their death on the Moon.It was written to announce to the world that the astronauts had been lost, and that the Moon mission was a failure. After it was read, the two astronauts would be given a ceremony something like the burial at sea, but one entirely without precedent.Created with Sketch.

But over time it became public, after being revealed by the man who wrote it, and is now available for the public to read.It was prepared in the case that the astronauts and their moon lander failed to get back to the main craft that was floating around in the Moon\u0027s orbit ready to bring them home, and contained Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin\u0027s\u0026nbspcolleague Michael Collins.Everything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingIn that case, it was most likely that those pioneering explorers would not lose their lives in a single spectacular moment. Instead, they would most likely be stranded, stuck 250,000 miles from Earth with no way of getting back home.In the end, and despite some very anxious moments, the crew would explore the lunar surface and come back down safely. That meant that, instead of announcing their loss, Nixon could instead share in the astronaut\u0027s success.In one of the most famous moments of the mission, he spoke to them in a phone call that was beamed around the world. He recognised the triumph of their achievement, and wished them safety for their return.Hello, Neil and Buzz, he said during that phone call.\u0026nbspI\u0027m talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House.And this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can\u0027t tell you how proud we all are of what you\u0027ve done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognising what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man\u0027s world.And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were a central part of a mission watched around the world, one which would define the century that followed, and which required intensive intelligence and ingenuity beyond our imagining\u0026nbsp– but at the moment they were engaged in housekeeping and sleeping.Now is the anniversary of perhaps the most unusual part of the Moon mission: that intermediate period after astronauts had completed the all-important liftoff, and as they waited, quietly drifting through space, on their way to the Moon.The launch happened on 16 July, 1969. The landing happened four days later, on 20 July.Between those days were a strange and eerie silence, filled with activities that would be humdrum were they not happening inside of the most ambitious activity ever launched by humankind.As the three astronauts – Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins –\u0026nbspfloated serenely through space, they began to think about what would happen at Earth. They were travelling at immense speed which meant that they had left the Earth quicker than many of those who had come along to watch would be able to get out of the parking lots they\u0027d viewed it from.Created with Sketch.

Collins was assisted by his two colleagues to separate the command module from the third stage of the Saturn rocket, and then spin it around and connect with the lunar module known as Eagle that would be used to descend to the service.Apollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketThis of course was a critical maneuver in the flight plan, Aldrin later said.\u0026nbspIf the separation and docking did not work, we would return to Earth.There was also the possibility of an in-space collision and the subsequent decompression of our cabin, so we were still in our spacesuits as Mike separated us from the Saturn third stage. Critical as the maneuver is, I felt no apprehension about it, and if there was the slightest inkling of concern it disappeared quickly as the entire separation and docking proceeded perfectly to completion.The nose of Columbia was now connected to the top of the Eagle and heading for the Moon as we watched the Saturn third stage venting, a propulsive maneuver causing it to move slowly away from us.After that was completed, the really stressful work was over. The astronauts could get to sitting out the journey, waiting until they reached their distant target.By the next day, the astronauts were able to darken the windows with covers that served as curtains, and try and get some sleep as the command module slowly rotated them through space. They\u0027d spend the following days doing chores and talking with Earth.During those intermediate days, there was considerably less activity on board the craft. Nasa\u0027s official timeline – which gives detailed information on absolutely everything the crew did – lists only a few activities over the course of the 17th and 18th, as the three astronauts floated through space.On 17 July, for instance, the crew simply conducted three TV transmissions and did one small burn of their engines to correct their course. The day after, there was another TV transmission and a quick journey into the lunar module and back so that it could be inspected ahead of the landing.But the day later, as they approached the Moon and, the atmosphere would change.Day four\u0026nbsphas a decidedly different feel to it, Collins later said.\u0026nbspInstead of nine hours\u0027 sleep, I get seven –\u0026nbspand fitful ones at that.Despite our concentrated effort to conserve our energy on the way to the Moon, the pressure is overtaking us (or me at least), and I feel that all of us are aware that the honeymoon is over and we are about to lay our little pink bodies on the line.At this point, everything became much more real: for one, the astronauts could once again see the Moon properly for the first time in nearly a day. They were now in orbit around the Moon, and it was vividly clear.The Moon I have known all my life, that two-dimensional small yellow disk in the sky, has gone away somewhere, to be replaced by the most awesome sphere I have ever seen, said Collins later.To begin with it is huge, completely filling our window. Second, it is three-dimensional. The belly of it bulges out\u0026nbsptoward\u0026nbspus in such a pronounced fashion that I almost feel I can reach out and touch it. To add to the dramatic effect, we can see the stars again. We are in the shadow of the Moon now, and the elusive stars have reappeared.At this point, the work to get ready to touch the lunar surface begins. The astronauts each carry out the checks that would try and ensure that the descent was as safe as possible, and that the lander that would carry them down was as secure as it could possibly be.Collins would spent yet more time on his own, waiting, as Aldrin and Armstrong jumped around the lunar surface. As they did, he waited, floating above the Moon – occasionally disappearing behind it and being plunged into the all-consuming quiet of the far side of the Moon –\u0026nbspand waiting for his two colleagues to make their return, before heading back to Earth.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

It held numerous government construction and maintenance contracts, for many of which the future is still uncertain“Unlike other mayors around the world, I have no powers over the private rented sector. That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And you’d have this incredible shot of green plants against a red background,” he said.SpaceX could land on the moon by 2021, Elon Musk claims (SpaceX)“My goal was simply to get the public excited, which would then get Congress excited so that they would appropriate more money and increase Nasa’s budget.”With the increasing success of SpaceX, Mr Musk has since extended his ambitions for the firm.

Now, the\u0026nbspspace agency is looking to put the first woman\u0026nbspand the next man on the lunar surface in 2024.“Being able to write that next chapter, knowing what has come before through Apollo and the shuttle programme, and knowing we are writing that next story is amazing.\u0026nbspIt is humbling to think about what they were able to do... especially considering they didn’t have the computing power we do,” she says. “That we are even in the same conversation... is incredible.”Spellman should know what the Apollo missions took, she works with veterans of that programme and while Nasa has had to build on that expertise over the past five decades the principles of that era-defining trip underpin\u0026nbspeverything she does.\u0026nbspThe current mission, called Artemis,\u0026nbspthe sister of Apollo, is daunting in itself. Having been set the task of returning to the moon in 2028, Donald Trump’s administration has\u0026nbspaccelerated that timeline. Vice-president Mike Pence said back in March that the later deadline was “just not good enough” and that “urgency must be our watch word”.While that may have something to do with that date being\u0026nbspthe end of a notional second term for Trump, the non-partisan Nasa is taking it in its stride.\u0026nbsp“It gets me really excited. I’m\u0026nbspexcited that we now have this really clear goal of boots on the moon by 2024...

A veteran of the 1960s effort, Poimboeuf said earlier this month: “This place is history in the making and it’s not over yet.”“It is not going to happen overnight... but it is comforting to know we are going through some of the same growing pains,” she adds.NasaEPA)Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy space centre in Florida has seen its fair share of history beyond Apollo, having also been used in the space shuttle programme from 1981 to 2011 – but its latest guise is unprecedented. It will now accommodate Nasa’s heavy-duty Space Launch System (SLS), which will power the crew-carrying Orion capsule into the heavens.\u0026nbspAs an example of the sheer magnitude of the changes, more than 1.3 million feet of copper\u0026nbspwiring used in the Apollo era has\u0026nbsphad to be switched to fibre optics.\u0026nbsp“It is a pivotal time for us – we are now testing the mobile launchpad and the launcher together so we are building up the system... we are getting really close to that first mission.” An unmanned test flight of Orion is due next year, with a crewed test to follow in 2022.What happened as astronauts headed towards the MoonApollo 11 launch video shows immense power of Saturn V rocketEverything you need to know about the Apollo 11 Moon landingLast remaining moon landing video tapes up for auctionBeyond Florida and the Nasa centres across the US, the elements around the mission are fraught. Some members of congress, who have to sign off the budget for Artemis, are wary of the costs and the few details provided so far.\u0026nbsp“We have a White House directive to land humans on the Moon in five years, but no plan, and no budget details on how to do so,” Kendra Horn,\u0026nbspchair of the House subcommittee on space and aeronautics, said back in May just before a 2020 budget was announced. That budget called for an extra $1.6bn\u0026nbspto fund Artemis for that fiscal year, on top of the $21bn\u0026nbspthe president already requested for Nasa.Costs for the following years are yet to be established but will rise, with estimates that Artemis could cost $20bn\u0026nbspto $30bn or more in total.\u0026nbsp“You are sort of asking congress to put a down payment on a car, but you don’t know what you are buying and you don’t know how much it will cost,” says Dr Mary Lynne Dittmar, who has decades of experience in the space field and is part of the Users’ Advisory Group of the National Space Council – the body reestablished by Trump under the direction of\u0026nbspPence to help guide policy.Nasa\u0026nbspadministrator Jim Bridenstine\u0026nbsptold a Senate panel\u0026nbspon Wednesday that a budget impasse and subsequent spending freeze later this year would be devastating for the chances of the Artemis mission.However,\u0026nbspwith the mission looking to set down roots for “national capability for decades” rather than just two or three trips to the moon,\u0026nbspDittmar believes it is a “different ball game” to the “war footing” of the 1960s space race. Later space missions in the 1970s and 1980s were “trying to apply a model that was specific to that one point in time... now it is a much different landscape”. More infrastructure and more countries are involved – which means the conversations over how missions will take place and what is needed will take longer.Dittmar does not doubt the political will to put humans back on the moon, but the pressure of the deadline means that things have to happen relatively quickly. Recent staff changes at the top of Nasa, initiated by those within the agency, may indicate that the urgency created by the White House is having an effect.In his speech in March, Pence raised the prospect of the use of commercial rockets to keep the mission on schedule. “If commercial rockets are the only way to get American astronauts to the moon in the next five years, then commercial rockets it will be,” he said. There are certainly advocates who believe this is the right strategy and it could reduce costs.\u0026nbspCharles Miller, who was part of the Trump administration’s transition team for Nasa in 2017 and was senior adviser for commercial space at Nasa from 2009 to 2012, believes that such partnerships between Nasa and outside companies are “fundamental”.\u0026nbsp“Artemis is an opportunity to have a complete break with the failed space policies of the last couple of decades... to open up the solar system in a way that is completely affordable and could be transformational,” he says.Why some people still believe that we never went to the Moon“If we go back to the moon in the way Trump wants and the way Obama did before him, by leveraging commercial partnerships, it can also be much faster and be of much more benefit to the world,” he adds. Miller, who is a serial space entrepreneur, says that if billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are putting up capital and so “have skin in the game” it is a win-win, even if there have been some failures in the past.I think the overall strategy the Nasa administration wants to execute will succeed, the only question is when... The old model of the ‘big costs and aerospace needs’ is on the verge of collapse,” he says.Dittmar, who is also chief executive\u0026nbspfor the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a trade group of more than 65 companies, sees things differently. She believes the space market needs to be at a tipping point where investors and company shareholders see the potential for returns and we might not be there yet.\u0026nbsp“I think public-private partnerships have a place, yes. Do I think it is a panacea? No,” she says,\u0026nbspalthough it is more likely the market may be in shape by the time Nasa is looking at heading to Mars once the Artemis mission is complete.\u0026nbspFor Dittmar, who was involved with work on the International Space Station (ISS), the implications of the Artemis mission are beyond business or even the limited scope that the Trump White House is projecting.\u0026nbspShe is looking for American leadership in space and being able to “keep the door open for others”. More than 100 countries have been involved in the various facets of the ISS mission both on the ground and in space and such cooperation will be crucial to make the most of the moon mission and beyond.Nasa\u0027s next great mission to the moonDittmar remembers the 1969 landing and says that it represents “one of the shining moments in humanity on par with figuring out the Magna Carta”. But the full impact may not be felt for generations and it is the same with the new mission.\u0026nbsp“I do believe that other nations are going to be watching and thinking ‘what does this mean for us?’” she says. “Inspiration is not just public inspiration its inspiration in engineering, in technology development.”“We are also going to learn about ourselves as human beings – being challenged by new environments,” Dittmar adds.Inspiration for the next generation is a key motive for Spellman, who has a young son.\u0026nbsp“We want this reality of working in maths and science to hit kids all over the world,” she says. “Now there is so much access to what we are doing – can you imagine the live feed coming from the moon and kids watching that? It will put it at the fingertips of children across the world and make it real to them that they could do something like this.”In fact, Spellman hopes the Artemis mission will provide a cultural touchstone for everyone.\u0026nbsp“I hope the mission brings us all together, for at least\u0026nbspa moment,” she says. When you think about everyone sitting around watching their televisions or listening on the radio when Neil Armstrong was taking the steps on the moon, it would be great to have that moment again.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also wants new powers to allow him to introduce a temporary cap on rents while the commission is doing its work to establish a longer-term system.Polls suggest that around two-thirds of Londoners favour rent controls which are in place in cities such as Berlin and New York.“It is high time for private renting in London to be transformed.

That’s why this landmark report sets out a detailed blueprint of what the government must do to overhaul tenancy laws, and what powers City Hall needs from them to bring rents down.”The proportion of people renting from private landlords in the capital has risen from 11 per cent in 1990 to 26 per cent last year.Research published last week by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that private rents are now unaffordable for workers on the median wage in London, the southeast, southwest and east of England, effectively pricing out many key workers such as nurses and primary school teachers.The problem is particularly acute in London where rents take up 42 per cent of the average pre-tax wage. Separate research by housing charity Shelter found that rents in several London boroughs are among the least affordable anywhere in the UK.\u0026nbspKensington and Chelsea is the least affordable borough, with average rents equivalent to 127 per cent of a low-earning family’s\u0026nbsppay, followed by Westminster at 111 per cent and Camden at 92 per cent.\u0026nbspLower-income working families in two-thirds\u0026nbspof England need to spend more than 30 per cent of their income to rent a two-bed home.Housing crisis: Nurses and teachers priced out of UK regions by risingThe mayor’s plans require a new bill to be approved by parliament handing him extra powers. Any new legislation is likely to come up against stiff resistance from the government which has previously stated its opposition to rent controls.A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the government had already taken “unprecedented action to transform the private rental market and protect the millions of tenants who live in rented accommodation”.Rent controls are controversial with some studies showing that in certain\u0026nbspforms they can benefit particular\u0026nbspgroups over others.A 2017 paper by researchers at Stanford University found that rent controls introduced in San Francisco led to some landlords converting\u0026nbsptheir properties into expensive apartments because these were classed as new builds which were exempt from the rules.The study found that the amount saved by people in rent-controlled properties was roughly cancelled out by more expensive rents for tenants in non-rent-controlled homes.Mr Khan’s report proposes additional measures, some of which the government has already said it wants to introduce, including introducing open-ended tenancies, and ending no-fault evictions. The mayor also says he wants to scrap break clauses and\u0026nbspimprove dispute resolution services for landlords and tenants.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Hammond not only abstained on the vote but he actively\u0026nbspwanted people to know he had done so.Hammond-led plot to sink no deal could kill off Johnson’s Brexit plansHe\u0026nbsptweeted:\u0026nbsp“It should not be controversial to believe that parliament be allowed to sit, and have a say, during a key period in our country’s history.”Mr Hammond seems to be at the head of an unlikely bunch of Tory rebels, a gaggle of sensible ministers who cannot get behind Mr Johnson’s demand to keep no deal on the table.Pro-EU ministers Greg Clark, the business secretary, Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, and justice secretary David Gauke\u0026nbspalso abstained, which suggests they know they are on their way out as well.It has been suggested that Mr Hammond played a key role in organising the rebellion, sending encouraging text messages to Tory ministers and urging them to abstain.\u0026nbspThe defeat is a taste of what prime minister\u0026nbspJohnson faces over the coming months.Ms May had a tough\u0026nbsptime trying to contend with the Brexiteers snapping at her heels, but Mr Johnson will have to go up against a\u0026nbspbunch of radicalised former cabinet ministers, who command the respect of plenty of Tory MPs.Mr Hammond has even suggested he might be prepared to bring down the government should the new PM push for a no-deal Brexit. Dominic Grieve and former chancellor Ken Clarke have also said they would consider such a move.If the Tories lose a by-election on Wales next month, the government’s working majority would be reduced to three – leaving Mr Johnson with almost no room for manoeuvre.If Mr Hammond becomes a “nightmare on the backbenches”, as he joked at a Treasury party earlier this month, then\u0026nbspMr Johnson may find delivering Brexit as difficult as his predecessor.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspsuggests\u0026nbspremediation efforts have stalled.More than 50,000 people are estimated to still be living in buildings that have been deemed as unsafe.The latest revelation came after the government admitted that the scale of the cladding crisis is much bigger than first thought.It had long been known that ACM panels were unsafe for use on highrise buildings, but on Thursday ministers announced that a second type of cladding had also been found to be highly flammable.It is not known how many blocks are covered in the second type of panel, called high-pressure laminate (HPL), but hundreds more buildings are likely to be affected.Advice issued by the government\u0026nbspsaid that “action to remediate unsafe HPL systems should be carried out as soon as possible”.Created with Sketch.Grenfell fire remembered two years on: In pictures Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Campaign group Grenfell United project a message

green to mark the second anniversary of the fire Kensington Palace is illuminated green to mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell fire Downing Street is illuminated green to mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell fire Further suspect types of cladding have yet to be tested, suggesting the problem could be greater still.Ministers announced this week that they wanted to see ACM cladding removed from all social sector buildings by December 2019 and all private sector buildings by June 2020.Currently just 1.25 private sector residential blocks on average are having ACM cladding removed each month, compared to an average of 3.5 for social sector blocks.This suggests that, at the current rate, the social sector work will only be completed in December 2021, and the private sector work not until May 2030.Facing pressure to do more to speed up the removal of dangerous materials, the government announced a £200m fund earlier this year to help private building owners remove ACM cladding, but critics said the money would not go far enough.As well as setting the new targets, James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, has said the government is considering punishing private block owners who are still refusing to take the cladding down after the end of this year.Labour said private blocks should be “confiscated” if owners refuse to comply and called on the government to do more to support owners who are struggling to cover the costs of removing the materials.Grenfell victimsSarah Jones, the party’s shadow housing minister, said: “The government has at long last set a deadline to remove ACM cladding, but at the current pace of work they will miss that target by a whole decade.“Ministers need to step in and help councils who are struggling to get this work done promptly. And they must clarify what enforcement action they will take against private block owners who fail to make their buildings safe. Labour has been clear that sanctions should include confiscation of blocks where necessary.“We now know that ACM is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the cladding scandal. Now the government has admitted HPL cladding is deadly, we urgently need answers on how many more buildings are covered in flammable materials and how quickly it will be removed.”Health chiefs ‘showed troubling lack of urgency over Grenfell cough’ Huge crowd marches in silence on second anniversary of Grenfell blazeSafety fears at scorched Barking flats ‘first raised after Grenfell’Matt Wrack,\u0026nbspgeneral secretary of the FBU, said:\u0026nbsp“The glacial speed of progress removing the very same flammable cladding as was on Grenfell Tower is simply shameful. To see so little progress removing dangerous cladding over the last month sums up the government’s half-hearted approach to public safety.“Despite the government’s own tests proving that high-pressure laminate cladding is not safe, they have made no commitment to remediation work. It’s as though they are waiting to see another tragic loss of life before they will protect the thousands at risk from other forms of flammable cladding.”A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We expect all building owners, unless there are exceptional circumstances, to complete remediation within six months of agreeing a plan – by June 2020 – or they will face enforcement action.“Owners are responsible for the safety of their buildings and it’s unacceptable if they are not moving quickly to remedy this problem – which is why the government has made £600m\u0026nbspavailable to pay for remediation and remove cost as a barrier to progress.“Ensuring the safety of residents still living in buildings with unsafe ACM cladding is a priority.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has also broken restrictions on its production of enriched uranium, used to make reactor fuel but also potentially nuclear bombs.Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking European Union\u0026nbspsanctions.\u0026nbspThe UK suspected Grace 1, detained\u0026nbspnear Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria.Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would be released if Tehran guaranteed its oil would not be given to the\u0026nbspcountry\u0027s president Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Tensions high as Trump approves new Iran sanctions: In pictures Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iran claims that in this picture released by Iran state TV, their surface-to-air missile is seen as it shoots down a US surveillance droneThis photo shows US RQ-4A Global Hawk unmanned surveillance drone.

The pictures suggests that the ship is \u0027likely\u0027 to have been hit by a mine as the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo moves to blame Iran for the suspected attackHere is a timeline of recent incidents involving the three nations:13 June: Two US oil tankers near the Strait of Hormuz were attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift, with 44 sailors evacuated from both vessels. The US Navy went to assist, with Mr\u0026nbspTrump blaming Iran for the incidents.Iran denied involvement in the tanker attacks and accused the US of promoting an Iranophobic campaign.20.20 June: A US military drone worth $100m\u0026nbsp(£78m) was downed by Tehran, with Iran\u0027s president Hassan Rouhani claiming it had violated their airspace.The move marked a new high in the rising tensions between the two countries, as Iran\u0027s naval commander warned his forces would not hesitate to down more US drones if they entered its airspace.Mr Trump then pulled back from the brink of retaliatory military strikes on Iran after he was told 150 people could die.He has since signed an executive order targeting Iran\u0027s supreme leader Ali Khamenei and his associates with financial sanctions.4 July: Royal Marines from 42 Commando were involved in an operation to seize a supertanker off Gibraltar suspected of carrying oil destined for Bashar Assad\u0027s Syrian regime. They boarded the ship by descending on ropes from a Wildcat helicopter and by using rigid inflatable boats.They worked alongside authorities in Gibraltar to detain the Iranian tanker Grace 1, which was believed to be heading to the Banyas refinery in breach of EU sanctions. In response, Iran\u0027s revolutionary guard warned a British oil tanker could be seized in retaliation.10 July: Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose drove off three Iranian vessels which tried to stop the commercial ship British Heritage.It is understood the tanker was making passage out of the Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz when the ship was approached by the Iranian vessels. HMS Montrose was nearby and proceeded to come in between.Warnings were given but no shots were fired. The Iranian vessels then turned around and left.11 July: Police in Gibraltar said they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the Iranian supertanker Grace 1 in relation to suspected violations of EU sanctions on Syria.Two days later the force said the captain, chief officer and two second officers of the vessel had been conditionally bailed without charge.13 July: In a telephone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt offered to facilitate Grace 1\u0027s release in return for guarantees from Tehran that it would not breach EU sanctions on the Assad regime in Syria.15 July: Mr Hunt attended a Brussels meeting of EU foreign ministers on the issue of the Iran nuclear deal. He\u0026nbspsaid there was a small window of hope for preventing the international agreement, aimed at stopping Tehran gaining nuclear weapons, from unravelling.Both he and Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson later ruled out supporting Mr Trump should he pursue military action in the Gulf.16 July: Ali Khamenei called the seizure of the Grace 1 tanker piracy and vowed to retaliate.\u0026nbspHe said: God willing, the Islamic Republic and its committed forces will not\u0026nbspleave this evilness without a response.17 July: US officials said they suspected Iran had seized a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker from the United Arab Emirates as it travelled through the Strait of Hormuz.\u0026nbspThe tanker had turned off its tracker three days before as it entered Iranian waters.Iran later said its Revolutionary Guard had seized a foreign oil tanker and its crew of 12 for smuggling fuel out of the country.18 July: Mr Trump said the USS Boxer had shot down an Iranian drone that came within 1,000 yards of the warship and ignored calls to stand down.Iranian military officials denied one of its drones had been lost in the Strait of Hormuz.19 July: Two oil tankers are reported to have been seized by Iranian authorities in the Persian Gulf.The Stena Impero, registered in the UK, was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard in the Strait of Hormuz for violating international maritime rules, the semi-official Fars news agency said.A second oil tanker, the Liberia-flagged Mesdar, owned and operated by Glasgow-based firm Norbulk, appeared to veer off course towards the Iranian coast.The Mesdar\u0027s operator said the ship was boarded by armed guards but the crew were left safe and well and allowed to continue their voyage.Jeremy Hunt called the ships\u0027 seizure unacceptable ahead of attending a meeting of the Government\u0027s emergency committee Cobra.Press Association contributed to this reportStrait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Seeing him inciting the crowd back in 1995 against the media, which really we see in Trump in 2016.“When you look back at how he operates, there is almost no chance of anyone combating him. He is so good at it. He is so sharp.”Fast-forward two decades and\u0026nbspNetanyahu, or “Bibi” as he is nicknamed, is still in office and remains\u0026nbspvery much a\u0026nbspmaster of social media.Although he lost the 1999 elections, the former soldier and diplomat would storm to power again on the heels of the 2009 war with militants in Gaza. He kept winning, securing a fourth consecutive term in office in April this year.In fact on Saturday this winning streak will make history, as he becomes Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, limping past the country’s founding father David Ben Gurion who served 4,875 days in office.His recent win came\u0026nbspdespite the fact\u0026nbspNetanyahu was campaigning under the shadow of indictment across three corruption cases, and\u0026nbspin just a few months faces the prospect of becoming Israel’s first serving prime minister to stand trial.Netanyahu accused of ‘spin’ after backing bid to scrap snap electionsIn a long line of firsts, Israel is also due to go back to the ballot box in September less than six\u0026nbspmonths after\u0026nbspthe last polls. Fresh elections were called when\u0026nbspNetanyahu could not form a new coalition government.Despite this,\u0026nbspas a caretaker premier, Netanyahu celebrated 13 years in office defiantly.“We have turned Israel into a rising global power,” he said in a special interview with Israeli daily Israel Hayom.“We have proven that Israel could be transformed from a small country in the corner of the Middle East into a major force on the global stage,” he added.He has maintained solid approval ratings, and although the latest polls show he may fail again to put together a coalition government, is still the favourite to win the September elections.Former advisers, observers and critics all agree he is a master in unstatesmanlike statesmanship.Benjamin Netanyahu’s wife Sara admits to misuse of public fundsTrump sends map to Netanyahu showing Golan Heights as part of IsraelAnalysis: Will this be the end for Netanyahu?Israel calls snap election just one month after last voteNetanyahu’s wife gets plea bargain in meals fraud caseHe has delivered to a right-wing majority Israel what it wants: a transformed, powerful economy\u0026nbspand comparative security despite two wars with Gaza, and the threat of conflict with Iran\u0026nbspand the forces it backs in Syria and Lebanon.“Over the past 10-year period it’s been pretty stable. We have ties with China, Russia, the Gulf,” says Anshel Pfeffer, author of Bibi, the Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.Meanwhile support for him within his right-wing Likud party is “unprecedented”,\u0026nbspPfeffer adds. \u0026nbspThere are many reasons for that.For a start,\u0026nbspPfeffer says the leader has a “unique” talent at leveraging small majorities to build coalitions\u0026nbspagainst the so-called “threat of the left”.“He manages to make settlers, immigrants, the ultra-Orthodox and the secular nationalists fit together in this coalition of outsiders.”Netanyahu has successfully batted off all potential rivals within his party including Avigdor Lieberman, Moshe Kahlon, Naftali Bennet and Ayelet Shaked, all former Likud members who broke away to build rival parties but have failed to form winning teams.Netanyahu celebrates his 1996 win he\u0026nbspreceived\u0026nbsp50.4 per cent of the vote to Shimon-Peres’s 49.5 per cent (Reuters)He has also impressively point-scored over his last term.Since the 2016 election of President Donald Trump, whose campaign style appears inspired by\u0026nbspNetanyahu’s delivery, the US has moved its embassy to Jerusalem, recognising the contested city as Israel’s capital.Washington has also recognised Israel’s sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, slashed all aid to the UN’s Palestinian aid agency and trashed the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, all key Netanyahu demands.Jared Kushner,\u0026nbspTrump’s son-in-law, delivered the first tranche of a regional peace deal last month which successfully avoided all references to a Palestinian state as a solution to the conflict, another key demand of the Israeli right.In fact, Netanyahu has proudly resisted various peace initiatives and allowed controversial West Bank settlements, which are illegal under international law, to flourish.He managed to “empty” the long-term left-wing battle cry that not resolving the Israel-Palestinian crisis would lead to total isolation, Pfeffer continues.“In that moment it seemed he could do anything, showing how far he had come.”And that is why at rallies people have taken to chanting “magician” at him.“He thinks that ... he is the one who will save Israel and lead Israel to a safe haven,” Aviv Bushinsky, a former Netanyahu aide, recently told\u0026nbspthe Associated Press. Israelis think that “things are good, so why should we change a winning horse,” he added.That said, many feel that this may be a period of calm before the storm.Tom Segev, an Israeli historian, agrees\u0026nbspthat while Netanyahu’s political longevity might be seen as a success story, “it may also be that ... we will remember him more for leading Israel down the road to more oppression of the Palestinians”.Filmmaker Shadur says: “It is difficult to pin down what defines his time in office.” Unlike his predecessors, Netanyahu has not left his mark by winning a war or signing a peace agreement.“It may be he will be responsible for a certain stagnation which will lead to a disintegration.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The British boozer is in crisis.More than a quarter of all pubs have closed in the past two decades, from , in  to ,, according to the Office for National Statistics. We are losing three pubs a day. At this rate we will see the end of the British pub within our letime.So I got together with two friends who, like me, had never been in the licensed trade, to rescue this wonderful, warm, welcoming, Grade II listed building so everyone can continue to enjoy it. And I am not alone.I know of whole communities that have got together through crowd funding to save their local, with £.million being raised through internet donations for ious establishments last year.People are coming to realise that we can’t afford to lose these treasured spaces. There is no social network that can beat the pub, particularly in a world so insular where people have their noses in a mobile phone the whole time.It is so important people sit up and have a good chat, whether it is with a stranger at the bar or one of the staff. Workers come in after grafting and want to speak to the barmaid about what a hard day they’ve had, about the van breaking down or the tractor engine blowing up.Pubs often have football teams, darts, dominoes, quiz nights and are a venue where many great bands played their first gigs. In other places you will find a small shop at the local, because the village one has closed.At The Half Moon we sponsor the village cricket team, have Women’s Institute meetings with tea and cake in the morning, charity events and people come to celebrate weddings, birthdays and anniversaries.And no, nanny state meddlers, this isn’t about encouraging drinking, it’s about popping down to the local for a pint once or twice a week, which isn’t going to do any harm.The pub is now a place that families visit and I want everyone to treat it as their home.  My mum is in the garden, my dad helps out and my son Indio comes in to ask our head barman: “Can I have the usual please” — by which he means an apple juice and a packet of crisps.I had noticed pubs closing, but I hadn’t realised the reason until I became a landlady myself. Someone needs to give this industry a break. Landlords and land–ladies can only make tiny margins on the beer they sell, due to the high taxes they have to pay.That’s why I got involved with the Long Live The Local campaign last year to help pressure the Government into freezing beer duty. Everything is trying to kill this incredible part of British culture, whether it’s business rates, beer tax or sugar tax.Our rates are three times the European average and we pay almost  per cent of all beer duty across the EU, while drinking only  per cent of the beer. But the industry employs around , — many of them young people — and puts £BILLION into the economy.I can’t thank The Sun enough for its support in helping our campaign. I don’t think we would have received as many signatures without the help of you, the readers. Thankfully, the Chancellor listened to our case, agreeing in the last budget not to raise duty on beer.Sin taxes are high enough already and I hope the next Prime Minister will give us a break. It was an honour to be named  Beer Drinker Of The Year by the All-Party Parliamentary Beer Group, which promotes the unique role of the pub in our society.Certainly there is hope that this great institution can survive by changing with the times and adapting to new tastes.  It is amazing seeing all the microbreweries and gin distilleries starting up, with a new generation enthusiastic about real ingredients.The gastro pub movement also offers customers the quality food they desire. We were proud that our restaurant received two AA rosettes for culinary excellence in the first six months.But there is also a need for a pub to be a pub, where customers can come in with their wellies or work boots. At The Half Moon we have good dining on one side and an old-fashioned fireplace that drinkers can gather round on the other.For the first year I was there all the time, but now it’s wiping its own nose, so I go in two or three times a week — it’s my other jobs that pay the mortgage. It’s a great place to wind down, particularly on a Sunday, and it brings me a lot of joy.When I got the lease for the pub, a friend advised me to make sure I stood back once in a while to peer through the windows to see people having a good time. That’s why Britain’s pubs have to be saved.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Just over , people have been sent ballot papers.The Lib Dems have been led by Sir Vince after Tim Farron resigned in June , saying he felt remaining faithful to Christ was incompatible with leading his party.Around  per cent of Lib Dem members voted Remain in the referendum and most are relaxed about immigration.The poll will close on June .Thats also the day the new PM is expected to be revealed.This has meant the exact timing for the announcement of the next Lib Dem leader is yet to be set.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I also couldn’t eat or drink because my nerve was exposed and every time I opened my mouth it hit the nerve.”Charlie’s family claim they later called the water park again for help, explaining that they were desperate and that the dentist provided was closed.They said they were then sent on a wild goose chase, being provided the addresses of three more dental surgeries – only to find each one closed for the weekend.Charlie added: “I had to cope in this pain for the whole holiday.Eventually, three days before flying, we found a dentist that was able to cap my teeth and hide the nerve until I got home.“Now I am home they have repaired my teeth but I am told I will have problems in the future.“I will need more work on them as the teeth can just die.Charlie said she wanted to share her story from last August to warn of the dangers of water parks after a British man snapped his neck on a similar slide.She added: “I definitely won’t be ing to the park now, or any water park as a matter of fact, especially slides in this same style, as I am afraid and I think they are extremely dangerous.“I was extremely wary of it [the ride] because it was head first, and you come flying down at some speed, however I decided other people was using it therefore it must be safe.“I have shared my story to warn people and to try and save more people from getting hurt.”Earlier this week, Brit David Brfaut, , broke two vertebrae and faces being paralysed for le following a freak accident after sliding head-first down the Splash ride on a board in Benidorm.It later emerged that the park, Aqualandia, had received a string of complaints about visitors suffering injuries on the slides.One holidaymaker, Joe Pollard, , told the Sun Online that his face was ripped open during a visit to the park on a stag do.He said: “I was in a lot of pain, and also I was in shock.

It was so obvious that I was not okay.“Honestly, the whole park felt dangerous.A spokesman for Aqualandia said it was “simply ” to suggest that the ride is unsafe.The spokesman said: “Moreover, we have video footage which shows Mr Brfaut didnt follow the guidelines for Splash.“Aqualandia has a long, -year history and safety is our top priority.

We have been trying to find a way to resolve Grace issue but WILL ensure the safety of our shipping.President Donald Trump last night called Iran nothing but trouble, adding: It goes to show I was right about Iran.Yesterday the British-flagged Stena Impero, which was bounded for Saudi Arabia from the UAE, suddenly changed course and was erted towards the island of Qeshm, where Irans Revolutionary Guard has a large base.Iran claimed the ship had failed to respect international maritime rules by switching off its tracker and heading the wrong way in a shipping lane.Irans state-run IRNA news agency since claimed the countrys seizure of British-flagged oil tanker was due to a collision with an Iranian fishing boat.The report said the British tanker caused damage to the fishing boat, then did not respond to calls from the smaller craft.Swedens Stena Bulk, the owner of the Stena Impero, said the Revolutionary Guard - classed as a terror group by the US - used small craft and a helicopter.Erik Hanell, president and chief executive of Stena Bulk, said: There are  seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.We are in close contact with both the UK and Swedish government authorities to resolve this situation and we are liaising closely with our seafarers families.The Liberian-flagged by British-owned Mesdar was also erted towards the mainland about  minutes later.It was said to have been stormed by gunmen but later released.Neither of the two ships had any British crew on board.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said the seizure of the tanker was completely intolerable and said the Government was seeking to establish diplomatic connections with Tehran.He told Today: The actions of the Iranians is completely unacceptable. It is so important that we maintain this free navigation through the Gulf and to seize a vessel in this way is just completely intolerable.UK vessels have been advised to stay out of the area of the Strait of Hormuz for an interim period, a government spokesman said.July : Royal Marines off the coast of Gibraltar seize the supertanker Grace  suspected of carrying Iranian oil to Syria.July : HMS Montrose trains its guns on Iran gunboats trying to hijack a British tanker, the BP-owned Heritage.July : Irans Ayatollah Khamenei called the seizure of the Grace  tanker piracy and vowed to retaliate, but Gibraltar is still holding it.July : Iran seized a Panama-flagged oil tanker from the United Arab Emirates as it travelled through the Strait of Hormuz.July : President Donald Trump reveals the US Navy shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz after warnings were ignored.July : Two British oil tankers are boarded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard in the Strait. One, the Stena Impero, is confiscated with  crew on board.The incident follows on from recent heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK.Last week, the Royal Navy warship frigate HMS Montrose drove off three Iranian vessels which tried to stop the commercial ship British Heritage as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz.Fears were raised the Iranian authorities were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the detention of the Grace  tanker.The Iranian ship was detained off the coast of Gibraltar on July  after it was suspected of violating EU sanctions by carrying a cargo of crude oil to Syria.The ships captain, chief officer and two second officers were arrested and bailed and an investigation is ongoing.Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the tankers seizure an act of piracy on Tuesday and warned the UK to expect a response.Mr Hunt offered to help release Grace Iran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assads regime.European allies to the US have been urged to take a tougher stance on Iran after Mr Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal with Tehran.On Thursday, Mr Trump said a US warship shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz - something denied by Iranian military officials.Last month, Mr Trump said he had made a last-minute decision to call off air strikes in retaliation for the shooting down by Iran of an unmanned US drone.The crisis has followed Mr Trumps decision to withdraw the US from the  nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powers."},{"url":null,"title":"harry potter fans muffins glass metal pins studio tour cafe","story":"Cafes at the world famous Warner Bros Studios Tour London were emptied after the horrying discovery.Bosses said they were taking the incident “extremely seriously” as police began a probe.The macabre stunt emerged after a worker found a shard of glass in a half-eaten muffin left by a customer on Wednesday.Managers launched an immediate investigation which, it is understood, revealed silver metal pins used at the attraction inside  muffins for sale.Bemused staff unaware of the discovery were ordered to scoop up all food for inspection.The Chocolate Frog Cafe, the Hub Cafe, the Food Hall and the Backlot Cafe were all closed for the day at the attraction in Leavesden, Herts.Bosses managed to keep the scare from visitors amid concerns there could have been a mass exodus from the site.It comes a few weeks after glass was found in a burger and has led to fears that a member of staff  may be responsible for the incidents.A source said: “It’s chilling and dark to think anyone could be so cold and calculating.“We get thousands of kids here every day.

It can be taken out sooneryou decide you want to stop using it.The implant is inserted in fat inside the upper left arm, where it secretes man-made chemicals that prevent the oies from releasing an egg. It also thickens the mucus from your cervix , making it dficult for sperm to move through it and reach an egg, and makes the lining of your uterusthinner so it’s less likely to accept a fertilised egg.Some of the symptoms that women can experience with the birth control implant includes nausea, headaches, mood swings, loss of sex drive and acne.The implant is over  per cent effective. Less than one implant user in  will get pregnant in one year.Only a doctor or nurse trained to fit implants can insert the implant. You can go to a contraception or sexual health clinic or to the doctor or nurse at a general practice.A specially trained doctor or nurse must take it out. They’ll give you a local anaesthetic injection in the area where the implant is and then will make a tiny cut in your skin and gently pull it out.It usually only takes a few minutes to remove an implant, and it it’s been put in correctly, it shouldn’t be dficult to remove.Occasionally, an implant is dficult to feel under the skin and it may not be so easy to remove. If this happens, you may be referred to a specialist centre to have it removed with the help of an ultrasound scan."},{"url":null,"title":"mum left toddler sorching car social services","story":"Jenner Ost, , reportedly left her son alone for almost two hours as the temperature inside the motor reached C.The boy was found watching a film on Osts mobile phone, police say.Ost had been attending an interview in relation to her other, newborn son at Anderson Community Hospital, Indiana.She was summoned by authorities to explain why shed checked the four-day-old baby out of hospital against medical advice, its claimed.During the appointment Ost was evasive belligerent and cursing, according to court documents.Almost two hours into the interview, police received a call to say the boy had been spotted inside a vehicle.Officers checked the car’s license plate and discovered it belonged to Ost, Fox reported.When questioned by cops, Ost allegedly said she left her son inside the car because he didnt want to come to the appointment with her.The mum-of-two was later charged with neglect of a dependent.Department of Children’s services workers took both the toddler and his baby brother into foster care, according to reports."},{"url":null,"title":"cops hunt two men gas tube oxford circus station","story":"British Transport Police have released images of the pair after the incident on a northbound Victoria line train which left passengers coughing at Oxford Circus at .am today.Were you at Oxford Circus  Did you see what happened  Email us at annabel.murphy@thesun or call   .

Her legacy speech typied her time as Prime Minister: Empty, uninspiring, forgettable, plodding and meaningless. If she was leaving the Big Brother house and they had to show her ‘best bits’ there would be an embarrassed silence before going to the adverts. Her actual legacy is three years of stubborn dithering that left Britain in a worse state than when she took over. Or rather, left us with Boris Johnson. Which is a bit like leaving a floater in the toilet at No. When historians describe her premiership, they won’t need to list her failures, like the botched general ­election or the Brexit red-lines ­shambles.    They won’t need to mention the falling letters during a conference speech or the P from a prankster. All they’ll need to write is the name of the least competent minister in the history of politics, whom she refused to sack: Chris ­Grayling. That, alongside a photo of his gormless mug, will perfectly capture how Britain became the laughing stock of the world. Even his name, Failing Grayling, was an era-defining moniker. This was the man who delivered more limp ­disappointments than a crate of snide Viagra.And as the minister also known as Mr Bean II, The Phantom Ferry Man, or Frank Spencer With a Condom On His Head – as he has always appeared to me – leaves the front benches, we need topay tribute.Because as the Shadow Attorney General Karl Turner noted during Grayling’s final Transport Questions session on Thursday, he was “the gt that kept on giving”. The problem was most of what he gave away went to private firms. Labour produced figures that showed his errors cost British taxpayers £.billion. Say that slowly. Two billion, seven hundred million pounds. In cock-ups. Which could have built five state-of-the-art hospitals serving city-sized populations. His greatest mishits included wasting £bn on the collapsed Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, almost half a billion on a bungled probation service privatisation and £million on a contract to a ferry company that didn’t own any ferries.

Leaders of the private community say there is no debt, no crime and no homelessness, and everyone has a job but none of them earn a salary. Outsiders in modern day Britain may find it baffling that none of the children watch television or play video games, no-one logs on to Facebook or any other social media sites to see what their neighbours are up to, and residents donapost carry mobile phones. Members of the -strong Darvell Bruderhof community must ask permission to begin ‘courting’ a person of the opposite sex, orces are banned, their jobs are chosen for them and they have no possessions.    A new documentary has been given extraordinary access to the community, which has quietly existed in Britain for almost  years and allowed TV cameras for the first time. The programme follows a number of members, including a young woman who has left the settlement and is questioning her future in the sect which refuses to join mainstream society. Located ten miles north of Hastings since , the near self-sufficient communityis in a converted tuberculosis sanatorium near the village of Robertsbridge.  The Bruderhof Christian movement is based around common ownership and was founded in Germany in  by protestant theologian Eberhard Arnold. The community was forced to flee in  after refusing to join the Nazi Party, and many members moved to England. But they left for Paraguay and then North America when members were threatened with internment in , only to later . Living as disciples of Jesus, members give up all possessions, money and status when they take their vow of commitment.  Everything is provided for them - from groceries to clothing - and members run a farm, orchard, schools and a multi-million-pound business which makes children’s toys and furniture. Itaposs a simple way of le, based on early biblical text, which is similar to the lestyles of the Amish. There is a personal cost and sacrice for residents, with strict rules and restrictions around same-sex relationships, orce and what members wear. Women avoid fashions of any sort, wearing modest clothing including headscarves, long plaid dresses and loose shirts. The unorm looks like traditional peasant dress.  Many decisions about the residentsapos lives are made for them, including where they live and the jobs they do. Family live in shared houses with several other families, and most meals are taken with other residents in a large communal dining room. Members are frequently moved between the other  Bruderhof settlements in the world. There are just , members wordlwide, and the other communities in the UK are in Nonington, Kent, and Peckham, south London.  Bernard Hibbs, , the community’s outreach director, is featured in the programme with his we Rachel. He said: We have a dferent vision for our society. We don’t proselytise, it’s unwholesome to try to make people become members. But we thought, aposWhy not show people how we live apos When I go outside the community, people are interested in it.  They worry about their kids and technology, and like the idea of sharing.  So we’re showing what we’ve learnt. It’s not perfect, butwe can encourage people to think about how they live, that’s great. Bernard, whose parents joined the community when he was nine, added: This is about people living according to the New Testament. People loving each other, sharing possessions and supporting each other. He rejected any notion that the Bruderhof is a cult, adding: People who have never visited us sometimes imagine that we might be a cult. But when they come, they find we are far too normal to qualy - there are no UFOs, no weird rituals, no secret handshakes.

Despite overcoming necrosis - a flesh eating bug - and corrective surgery earlier this year, Mr Parke claimed his bum implants continued to rupture and leak. With no other options available, this week he flew back to Istanbul, in Turkey, to attend a dferent clinic in a bid to correct his botched surgery. He said he was horried when his surgeon allegedly informed him that he believed breast implants - which could have ruptured at any point - had been used instead.   Unlike bum implants, which can withstand weights of up to lbs before rupturing, fake breasts are softer and cannot support as much weight.Mr Parke, from Dudley, in the West Midlands, slammed the clinic which conducted his first surgery, saying he could have died from sepsis had the implants ruptured.He said panic set in when a huge hole appeared in his right cheek, which quickly filled with puss and flesh.    Mr Parke said: I canapost believe they discovered I had breast implants in my bum. I had no idea. No one in the UK was able to help as Iaposd had my surgery abroad and it needed to be corrected as soon as possible. It has been a total disaster from start to finish. I could have died... but thankfully I sought help before it got to that point. He said he spent £, on surgeries on his bottom - £, on the initial operation, and a further £, to correct it.Mr Parke described himself as a huge fan of Kim Kardashian , vowing to stop at nothing to replicate her signature posterior.He added: It didnapost put me off having more surgery, I just ensured I booked with another clinic for my second bum lt this time. Mr Parke has spent approximately £, on more than  cosmetic procedures in eight years - including three nose jobs, a chin implants, eyebrow tattoos and Botox.    He said: Iaposm obsessed Kim K and the feminine look. I had my first surgery at just  when I had my nose done. Nearly almost every part of my face has been tweaked but I like to look dferent. Iaposd always hated my bum but I knew no clinics in the UK would give me the c implants I wanted, and thataposs why I went to Turkey. But Iaposm just hoping this is the last of my bad luck and others use my story as a warning. Mr Parke added will undergo another BBL surgery - the Brazilian Bum Lt - in December.

It seems such a simple thing, but for Ruby and Rosie, just being in their own separate incubators was nothing short of extraordinary. For just  hours earlier the girls had been born conjoined at the abdomen. Sharing part of the intestine and bowel, doctors decided to do the risky separation surgery immediately. Angela and husband Daniel could only wait as surgeons separated the girls in a five-hour operation. Their chance of survival was just %.    But, against the odds, the surgery was a success. Recalling how they first saw the twins after the surgery in July, , Angela says: “We were just sat in the middle of both cots, looking from one to the other.” Angela, , is one of the few people who can begin to understand how mum Zainab Bibi must have felt this week when her twin girls finally left hospital. Her two-year-old daughters Safa and Marwa Ullah, who were born conjoined at the head, were successfully separated by surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.  Angela says: “Seeing another family go through this makes me feel happy for them that both their girls made it. “There are so many conjoined twins where one or neither of the babies make it, so I feel such joy for them.” Now, sitting in her garden in Bexleyheath, South East London, watching Ruby and Rosie playing on swings on the climbing frame, Angela is in no doubt about how far they have come. Or how dferently things could have gone. Conjoined twins are rare, accounting for one in every . million births worldwide. Half are stillborn and of those who do survive, % live for only one day.    Great Ormond Street Hospital has successfully treated more conjoined twins than any other hospital in the world and expect to see three sets a year. The moment Angela was told she was expecting conjoined twins at her -week scan is seared in her memory. She says: “I was numb. I just thought, ‘Why me  Why’s this happening to me  What have I done to deserve this ’. “It’s supposed to be the happiest time of your le and I was being told they’re probably not going to survive the birth.”  Angela searched the internet for answers and was devastated by what she found. She says: “I was told not to Google anything, but it’s the first thing you do. “It was scary, you see some terrible things, extreme cases. “It’s just so rare, you never think it’s going to happen to you. I hadn’t even bought any baby things because we didn’t want to tempt fate.”  Angela gave birth by caesarean at University College Hospital in London on July , , and remembers the moment she first saw her daughters. She says: “I just saw two perfect little girls wrapped in a blanket. Yes they were joined at the tummy, but they also had their arms, their legs, all their little fingers and toes.” Soon after, they were rushed to Great Ormond Street. She says: “They were in intensive care. The nurses put them in my arms. I got to hold them. “It was really special. I went with them to theatre and off they went, through those doors.” When Angela read about Safa and Marwa it brought back painful memories. She says: “It reminded me of those times when my newborn babies were taken down to surgery at  hours old.  “As I was signing a consent form for their surgery, in my mind I was thinking, ‘Are they going to come back ’. “Like that mother, I know what it feels like to think there’s a chance your babies won’t be coming back once the doctors open them up and started operating.” Then came the longest wait of Angela and Daniel’s lives.  They sat in a family room, the opening ceremony of the Olympics on TV. Angela says: “I was just thinking anything could’ve happened. “Something could’ve happened to one of them, or both.” Five hours later they got the call confirming their girls had come out of surgery.  Showing me a photo where she is holding her girls for the first time after their separation, she says: “It felt amazing to hold them both together, but separated. “It was what I was waiting for. I was scared to hold them, scared I would drop them or hurt one, they were so tiny.” Angela, like Safa and Marwa’s mum Zainab, has nothing but total gratitude to the team of  doctors who saved her twins.  She says: “Without Great Ormond Street, I don’t knowthey’d still be here. If we lived in a country where they don’t have advanced medicine they probably wouldn’t be here.” Like Ruby and Rosie, Safa and Marwa will be in and out of hospital, possibly for the rest of their lives. Angela says: “My advice to Zainab is to take each day as it comes and enjoy those precious moments. Every milestone is amazing.  “There were so many times I thought the day would never come – their first steps, their first day at school, our first holiday. “I spend most of my time looking at them in amazement at how far they’ve come – how dferent it could have beenthey could not have been separated.” When the twins were finally able to leave hospital almost three weeks after surgery, Angela knew they were happier together.  She says: “They were together in one Moses basket. “I wanted to keep them together – they were more content. They’re still like that. “This morning I went to wake them and they were in Ruby’s bed together.”  On Friday, Ruby and Rosie turn seven. At the mention of their birthday, the girls bound over. “We’ve already had our party,” says Ruby. “On my birthday I want to go to see Toy Story .”  Angela is open with the twins about their start in le, asking: “You know you were born joined together, don’t you ” “Yeees!” Rosie says. “I said to my teacher, when we were learning about inspirational people, I said me and Ruby.” “Because we’re special!” Ruby interrupts.  Out playing with their protective -year-old sister Lily, the twins always stay close, holding hands. Angela says: “When they were due to start school I told the head I didn’t want them separated because there was a point in their lives where you couldn’t physically separate them. “They have been through so much. They have a special bond.” "},{"url":null,"title":"seized british tanker centre storm","story":"NewsSeized British tanker at centre of storm in Persian Gulf is pictured by IranA news agency claims the pictures and footage show the seized British-flagged oil tanker the Stena Impero in the Iranian port of HormozganShareCommentsByChris kitchingSenior ReporterTalia Shadwell:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video iran-releases-video-claiming-show-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British tanker that is at the centre of a storm in the Persian Gulf after being seized by Iran has been pictured apparently anchored in a port in the Middle East. The Iran Students News Agency , which is partially funded by the countryaposs Government, released images today as tensions in the region escalate. Defence secretary Penny Mordaunt told Sky News the tanker was intercepted in Omani waters, describing the incident as a hostile act - and denied reports a British warship was  minutes from the tankeraposs position - saying it was an hour away from being able to help. This afternoon, Britain summoned the Iranian Charge daposAffaires in London for talks over the seizure.    The pictures and footage purportedly show the Stena Impero in the port of  the city of Bander Abbas, the capital of the southern coastal region of Hormozgan, even as the UK Government vows retaliation over the seizure. The Iranian reports say the vessel was not carrying any cargo and its detained crew may be subjected to technical interviews.  IranapossCouncil, a powerful constitutional watchdog, says the seizure of the tanker was in response to Britainaposs role in seizing an Iranian tanker earlier this month. The Stena Impero had been sailing through the Strait of Hormuz to Saudi Arabia when it was seized by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard on Friday.  The British warship the HMS Montrose sped to help the UK-flagged oil tanker as it was being seized by Iran, but the frigate was ten minutes too late, it was reported. A defence source told The Times frigate was dispatched while the Stena Impero was in Omani waters, however it arrived after the tanker had entered Iranian territorial waters. The source told The Times Iran appeared to be taking a very aggressive stance and was viewed as having been ready to engage HMS Montrose  she had arrived in time. However Mordaunt told Sky HMS Montrose was an hour away from the tankeraposs position, not  minutes. The incident has led Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to vow a robust but diplomatic response. He offered to help release  Grace , which was seized in Gibraltar on July  on suspicion of smuggling oil to Syria in breach of EU regulations.    If Iran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assadaposs regime. He tweeted this morning: Yesterdayaposs action in Gulf shows worrying signs Iran may be choosing a dangerous path of illegal and destabilising behaviour after Gibraltar’s LEGAL detention of oil bound for Syria. As I said yesterday our reaction will be considered but robust. We have been trying to find a way to resolve Grace issue but WILL ensure the safety of our shipping. The US Secetary of Defence Richard Spencer also announced he would send hundreds of troops, aircraft and missiles to Sauda Arabia in order to counter any potential aggression from Iran.    The affair has led the former head of the Royal Navy Lord West to blast for the British forces for having too few ships as he labelled it extraordinary that the Stena was travelling through the tense region without an escort. Iranaposs semi-official Fars news agency claimed on Saturday that the detained tanker was in an accident with an Iranian fishing boat and ignored its distress call.    Today Fars quotedCouncil spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei as saying that the rule of reciprocal action is well-known in international law. The council is viewed as representing the views of Iranaposs supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Kadkhodaei said Iran made the right decision in the face of an illegitimate economic war and seizure of oil tankers. Two British oil tankers were seized by Iran - the Stena Impero and the Mesdar, a Liberian-flagged vessel which is managed by Norbulk Shipping UK.

It also has its own in-hand farm, native woodland a small private harbour and bespoke ferry.    It has a fascinating history, having been a target of Viking raids and used as a D-Day training ground - with bomb craters still visible in its landscape. A farmer even discovered the remains of a local Bronze Age woman, the Queen of the Inch, on the island in the s. She lay in a stone cist wearing a black lignite necklace and carrying a flint dagger.  The owners have put it on the market with estate agents Strutt  Parker. Diane Fleming, sales agent for Strutt  Parker in Edinburgh, said: Inchmarnock is a stunning island rich in possibility. There is already a successful farming enterprise and a lovely family home on the nearby shore of Bute but there is signicant potential to build up the sportings, develop the existing residential offering and to capitalise on the ious amenities offered by the island such as the native woodland, watersports and fishing.  A Scottish island embodies the romance many people associate with the countryaposs prime estates and farms. Inchmarnock is stunning with great heritage and is a peaceful and secluded haven, yet it is relatively accessible from Scotlandaposs central belt. We expect signicant interest from national and international buyers.

She studied hard, earned a degree in international relations at London South Bank University and dreamed of a career with a humanitarian organisation or the United Nations. A devoted daughter of two Post Office workers who had come to Britain from Pakistan, the family observed Muslim customs without being strict and Diana wore a headscarf when she was around them. But then her world was abruptly turned upside down. In a drastic bid to avoid an arranged marriage, she gave up everything and travelled to Iraq to become one of a small band of British jihadi brides.Here, in an exclusive extract from his new book, Operation Jihadi Bride: My Covert Mission to Rescue Young Women from ISIS ,former soldier John Carney reveals her story, how he rescued her and her new le back home in Britain... Diana had been led to believe the holiday with her two brothers had been arranged as a gt for her doing well in her degree. What she had not imagined was their trip to Pakistan was to introduce her to her future husband, a distant cousin from the rural village. Malik was twice her age. He had yellow teeth and didn’t speak a word of English. As Diana gazed at Malik across the room, her world fell apart. When they ed to London, Diana couldn’t eat. She couldn’t sleep. She cried bitter tears. She tried to reason with her parents but a wall had grown up between them. They had allowed her the freedom to go to university. That was enough. After  years in England her parents were outwardly liberal, assimilated, but their mentality remained in the Hunza Valley. Diana wanted to run away, but to where, with whom  Her education had all been for nothing.  She went on ­line and wat­ched docu­­­­mentaries made in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan. She wept over photographs of children with missing limbs in shattered hospitals. Diana had lived obliviously in London while people like her were fleeing their homes from firebombs, shelling, drone attacks and barrel bombs. She found her way to a chat room where she made friends with a woman her own age named Eva, a British-born Muslim who had fled to the ISIS caliphate. As she and Eva talked through the night on Skype, Diana felt uplted, inspired, needed. Eva offered an alternative, the chance to really find herself. When she woke the following morning, the knots in her stomach had untied. Diana took her savings from the bank. She found her passport in a drawer and crept out of the house before daybreak, dressed the way she always had. She had a one-way ticket on the Eurostar from St Pancras to the Gare du Nord. In Paris, she caught the Deutsche Bahn for Stuttgart and Budapest, where she changed trains for Istanbul. No one asked any questions. Why would they     People had tracked her journey. Two lads were waiting for her at the station in Istanbul. They drove her to the city’s smuggling hub in Aksaray. There she joined several other girls in a Volkswagen  van that took them across country to an unguarded spot in the razor-wire fence iding Turkey from Syria. She changed from blue jeans into a long black abaya with a full-face niqab. She knew before she reached Mosul that it had all been a terrible mistake. Every girl who travelled to the caliphate and married a jihadi had their own story, but at the heart of each one was the culture clash between their daily le and experiences in Europe and the demands of Islam. It was nine months later when I spoke to Roy Underwood a contact in Mosul, Iraq. “There’s a girl here, Sophian. Australian. She’s got a baby and wants out, like yesterday…” “Can we get to her ” “I told her to wait till we were liberated by you guys. But the baby needs treatment for something or other.“Hey, man,” he said, like it was anafterthought. “Hope you’ve got room for another one ”“Another what ” “Another girl. She’s already tried to get out once. She’s dead keen to have another go.” “More the merrier, mate,” I told him. I spotted Roy, hands behind his back. His faint nod said he had recognized me.  He strode through the throng. Two women in black, one with a baby, bobbed along submissively in his wake. He opened the sliding rear door and waved his hand dismissively as they climbed in. He snapped the door shut. Some men risk their lives to save unknown babies. Some men throw live babies into burning pits with their dead mothers. British intelligence would tell me that anyone who had joined Islamic State was considered an enemy of the state and should be executed. Members of humanitarian organisations wanted to bring these people home to de-radicalisation programmes and fair trials. A fresh fusillade of shells thumped into the walls along the route. Visibility through the dust storm was down to a few inches, shielding us from the jihadi machine guns. They were keeping their heads down and the few bursts they let off pinged from the vehicles without doing any serious damage. In  minutes we were back to the relative safety of the Kurdish lines then through the contemporary ruins of Mosul to the prehistoric ruins of Nineveh. The girls had not spoken a word. I glanced over my shoulder. They were motionless like two black statues holding hands. The baby was silent. Traumatised babies don’t cry.    “You can take your headgear off nowyou want to,” I said. It was a couple of seconds before they did so. It was obvious which of the two girls was Sophian, she was holding the baby. It was even more obvious who the other girl was. Her photograph was on my laptop. I must have looked at it a hundred times. “Diana Abbasi,” I said. “Mr Carney.” Back in Erbil, Diana and Sophian washed in the clanking apparatus we called a shower. When they finally appeared, Sophian and Diana had transformed from unidentiable black sacks into normal young women in the embroidered dresses of the Kurds. The pair were painfully thin, with pronounced cheekbones, stick wrists and haunted expressions. They ate without speaking or looking up, one plate after another. I made mint tea and we sat at the table nursing the glasses. “Thank you,” Sophian said. She glanced at her baby, Yusuf. “I had to get out for him. You can’t imagine…” She broke off. Tears flowed down her gaunt cheeks. She sobbed. It was contagious. Diana sobbed too. Two young women overcome with relief, the tension pouring from them like an electric current. “What can’t I imagine ” I asked softly. Sophian brushed at her tears with the back of her hand. “It’s like a story on another planet. You know, like Star Wars,” she said. “Women are just baby factories. We’re pieces of meat. They have no respect, no kindness, no… humanity.” “They raped me,” Diana added, lowering her eyes, saying the words that must have been festering inside her, a great poisonous ball of shame and rage. “They raped me every day. Not one man. Two or three or four. I was a virgin… no one will want me now.” They cried again. They were going to need a lot of tears to wash away all the anger, the suffering. Sophian and Diana were victims. They didn’t need to be de-radicalised. They reviled Islamic State. They wanted Islamic State with its clerics and commanders and boy soldiers wiped from the face of the earth. If counter-terrorist officers understood that, they could learn from these girls. They could teach them how to turn others. They weren’t terrorists. They were potential assets. “We were promised heaven,” Diana said. “It turned into hell.” “Worse than hell,” Sophian added. Diana said: “We thought we could create a new identity, a new reality.” She paused for a second. “We face race hatred every day. In London, every time I wear a headscarf on the bus or the Tube, someone will screw up their face at me. Women as much as men.” “But you didn’t want to marry someone chosen by your parents ” I reminded her. Diana lowered her eyes. “That’s the problem for people like me, like us,” she replied. “I don’t belong anywhere, not here, not in Pakistan, not at home.” “Still you want to go back ” Of course. I’m English. I was born in London.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tourists told leave venice after","story":"NewsTourists told to leave Venice after they were caught making coffee on bridge stepsThe German tourists behaviour was viewed as so inconsiderate they were ordered to leave the cityShareCommentsByTalia Shadwell:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsThe German tourists were snapped making themselves coffee on the bridges steps \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo German backpackers have fallen foul of authorities in Venice after making themselves a brew on the steps of the cityaposs famous Rialto Bridge.

In what has been described by medics as a very rare incident, the Portuguese woman was rushed to hospital with abnormal bleeding from her vagina. Her mystied doctors could not initially find her implant - a small, hard rod usually located in the upper arm. Scans found that the contraceptive was in the bottom of the -year-oldaposs left lung. The incident was reported by doctors from the gynaecology department of a hospital in Viana do Castelo,  miles north of Porto. They speculated that the implant, which is supposed to remain in place for three years, had found its way into her blood vessels, which carried it to the lungs.  The technique used to insert the implant was blamed, with the experts saying it was embedded too deeply. They said: Risk factors formigration are placement technique –introduced deeply migration can occur into the venous system and then to the pulmonary arterial system. And the practice of vigorous physical exercise after correct placement, which seems to increase the risk of vascular migration. The unnamed woman made a quick recovery after surgery, and was sent home after four days. She had used contraceptive implants for eight years before the bizarre situation developed, but then suffered the bleeding for three months. Few cases have ever been described in medical reports, the Portugese doctors wrote in BMJ Case Reports, a reputed medical journal.   Speaking about another womanaposs case last year, experts told the Daily Mail that women should check their implants regularly to make sure they have not moved.Dr Tania Adib, a consultant gynaecologist at the Kensington Medical Chambers, said: The risk of the contraceptive implant travelling is extremely low. Risk is higherit isapost placed beneath the skin properly e.g. it is placed too deeply. The risk is higher in women who are very thin and those who are placing the implants should have specic training in how to insert them properly to reduce the risk. Contraceptive implants are tubes, roughly the size of a matchstick, which are inserted under the skin in the arm. They typically last for three years, releasing a steady dose of the hormone progesterone, preventing oies from releasing an egg every month. It also thickens the lining of the cervix – preventing sperm from entering - and thins the lining of the womb, making it less likely that a fertilised egg can implant.    The implants – known by the brand name Nexplanon – can be fitted by a specially trained GP or nurse. Girls undergo a brief consultation to ensure they do not have any underlying health conditions which would put them at risk. These include heart disease, liver disease or being pregnant. In rare cases the implants have been inserted incorrectly and travelled to the lungs or major veins. Experts say they are effective  per cent of the time, and are more reliable than remembering to take the Pill or using a condom. They take only a few minutes to be fitted and girls are given a local anaesthetic.

The future is bright for the place.”After drawing at Hearts in their opener, United are now sitting on four points in Group A, a point behind the Jambos.With home ties against Cowdenbeath on Friday and East Fe next Tuesday to come, they are looking good to progress as one of the second-placed teams with the best record.“All in all it’s been good. Three points from this one and we’re sitting with four points after the draw at Tynecastle and a hard game here.

And Aberdonian Campbell was thrilled to mark his first start in Europe with a win.He said: “It is a dream come true to play in a European competition and to play my part in a win in my first start which takes us through to the next round is fantastic.“I really appreciate the gaffer’s trust in me by putting me into a game like that.“It’s down to me after that to prove why he shows the faith in me and as long as he keeps doing that I have to keep working hard and do as best as I can when I get the opportunity.”Campbell was given the chance to play due to Craig Bryson missing the first round with an ankle injury.With Bryson due to resume training on Sunday and new signing Funso Ojo also joining the squad for next week’s second qualying round tie at Chikhura Sachkhere of Georgia, Campbell faces a fight to keep his place in the side. But he will use team-mate Ferguson’s success in holding down a regular place in the team as inspiration.]He said: “I’m comfortable in this team and feel I can cope with first-team games and European games. I just have to keep working as hard as I can and the manager will keep his faith in me.“Fergie had a terric season last year and will only kick on. He’s a fantastic young player and I enjoy playing alongside him so hopefully this is a partnership which we can develop.”Campbell, a product of the club’s youth system, has grown up watching the first team try to reach the group stages of the competition. This campaign, the sixth in a row under manager Derek McInnes, represents as good an opportunity as any.The importance for the club and the team in making it to the group stages has not been lost on the teenager.Huge clubs such as Premier League Arsenal and Manchester United as well as Italian side Roma lie in wait.The Aberdonian, a lelong Dons fan, is living his dream in being involved in European competition with his home city side.He said: “It’s always been an ambition, even as a little kid, to play in a European competition.“To get my first start is brilliant.I’ve watched the Real Sociedad games, the Groningen games as a fan so to be part of it is great.“All Aberdeen fans know of the glory days against Real Madrid and Bayern Munich but times have changed due to the money in the game now.“We’ve just got to do all we can to get to the group stages and that starts with the next round in Georgia.“It would be absolutely brilliant to get there.“That’s our aim every time we go into this competition and to get through would be fantastic for the players and financially for the club. It’s huge. I want to test myself against the best competition that is out there.“European competition is the cream at the top of the game.”The last time Aberdeen played in the group stages was during Jimmy Calderwood’s reign. The Dons reached the last  of the Uefa Cup in  before being eliminated - on aggregate by German giants Bayern Munich.Campbell was still at primary school during that run but the memories remain vivid today.He said: “I was a season ticket in the South Stand. I used to sit next to the away fans and I loved it. I was at the Bayern game in  and I remember that one and the Copenhagen game.“I would have been seven years old watching games like that so it’s great to be here  years later.“Hopefully I can kick on.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.42826305-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.42826305-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.42826305-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.42826305-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes started homework early","story":"Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes began preparation for the Europa League clash with FC Chikhura Sachkere on the flight back to Scotland after defeating RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland.McInnes studied scouting reports of the Georgians’ two games against CS Fola Esch of Luxembourg in the previous round on the flight which touched down early yesterday morning.He will also study extensive footage of Sachkere who the Dons face at the Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena, Tbilisi, on Thursday .McInnes said: “We had match reports to read on the Georgians on the plane on the way home and will start to get a grip on them over the next few days.“We had our scouts out for both their games against Fola Esch.

This is going to let us trace the stories of the people linked to the first reference of the still.“The royal references are really limited but these will allow us to build up the story with the surrounding context. It’s going to let us put names and inidual people to the story of this still.”The record also includes suggestions about where the still may have been located – with the spot believed to be on a street already associated with whisky.Dr Armstrong added: “Andrew Gray had property in a street known as Guestrow.“Today just a small section of Guestrow remains and it is home to the appropriately named ‘Illicit Still’ pub.“The name recalls a later age when whisky was crafted for sale undetected by the taxman, but it is possible that its location has a connection to the history of Scotch going back much further.“This is a very signicant find in the history of our national drink. It reframes the story of Scotch whisky and suggests new layers of complexity in Scotland’s urban history.” vw, px\"  Dr Hawes said: “All references to aquavite or whisky from this period are signicant because its early development is largely unrecorded.“This could signicantly change our understanding of the origins of our national drink.”City archivist Phil Astley added: “This incredible find illustrates what an amazing resource the UNESCO-recognised Aberdeen Burgh Registers are for the study of Scottish urban history.“The detailed picture of late-medieval society that emerges from these records is one of a developing social structure increasingly influenced by the cultural, scientic and educational forces of the Renaissance period.”Researchers have now been awarded £, by Chivas Brothers to fund research into the still.Head of heritage and education Alex Robertson said: “This is a truly signicant and exciting discovery for Scotch whisky.“Given Chivas Brothers’ historical ties with Aberdeen, we did not hesitate to lend our support to the furtherance of this important research.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 7 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is disappointing that Michael Matheson was unable to attend his second A task force meeting in a row.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

already addressed any issues that were raised in the consultation and therefore problems raised by the CAR were no longer applicable.There was also a question over whether the premises planned for the

was possible.Letters of support for the pharmacy were submitted by Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council and ward councillor Kenny McLeod among others however, the committee felt that none of these letters ldquospecied needs which were currently not being met.Pharmacy applicant Niamh Morrison visited the community council to thank members for their support over the process and to assure

The place was maybe a little bit quieter during the day when it was centred on the golf course.ldquoIn general, we were quite lucky with the weather.Gullanersquos Co-op store was also affected by the tournament, with traffic encouraged to avoid the village.Greg Millar, store manager, said: ldquoWe actually did better than what I thought we would but didnrsquot do as well as the business thought we would,that makes sense.ldquoIt could have been a lot betterthe traffic was erted through Gullane.Meanwhile, Tricia Johnstone, of Fenton Barns Farm Shop and Cafe, felt the event had a detrimental impact on their business.She said: ldquoIt damages business more than increases it.ldquoA lot of people just stay away.But Carol Millar, from The Golfers Rest on North Berwick High Street, said the pub was ldquobusy, adding: ldquoOn Friday and Saturday it was absolutely crazy. I donrsquot knowit is because we are called The Golfers Rest but it was quite busy.Tom Drysdale, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, which also covers Dirleton, said the impact in terms of flow of people and traffic through the village was ldquonot very signicant.He said: ldquoI went on Saturday and Sunday and there was a wonderful atmosphere. I think it was a very good thing for the area.ldquoI think it would be fair to say it did not have a major impact on the village of Dirleton itself but, speaking as a community council for the other areas, it was a big event for us and brought a tremendous number of visitors to the area and I think that has a long-term

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abour how Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9981084.jpg?htype=200\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Over the past decade many more have followed suit on bare walls, barren spaces and neglected nooks to create a vibrant tapestry of artworks.Glasgow City Council launched its mural trail in  and the accompanying web-app has since been downloaded almost , times to date. Several companies, such as Walking Tours in Glasgow and Photo Walk Scotland, have begun offering dedicated guided street art tours.Its an ever-changing landscape with new murals appearing all the time: artist James Klinge is currently working on what is envisaged to be a -strong series next to The Arches at Midland Street. The first ndash a self-portrait of Klinge ndash is already proving hugely popular.It joins an impressive body of work that Klinge already has on show around the city, including a clutch of animal-themed murals: Tiger Style on Clyde Street, Glasgow Panda in Gordon Lane and the Charing Croc which lurks beneath an underpass at, you guessed it, Charing Cross.Klinge has also painted a series of murals ndash three to date ndash as part of his Study of a Woman in Black project which adorn walls at the Saltmarket, St Andrews Street and Royal Exchange Square.The -year-old artist reveals there is much meticulous planning and preparation before he heads to the sites with his spray paint cans in hand. \"The majority of the work happens in my studio preparing the hand-cut stencils for each piece,\" says Klinge. \"It is intricate work to capture the detail.:Street artist Smug talks about creating some of Glasgows best-loved murals\"With Study of a Woman in Black at Royal Exchange Square that was about three weeks preparation cutting stencils in my studio and then three days to paint on site. The stencils do take a long time.\"The new mural at The Arches has gone up pretty quickly and people are amazed how quickly it has gone up, but it has taken me a month to cut the stencils. Figurative work is primarily what I do, and this job has allowed me to continue bringing my figurative work onto the streets of Glasgow.\"There are around  locations on the mural trail. At Strathclyde University on the corner of North Portland Street and George Street, a clutch of giant artworks pay tribute to alumni and their achievements.Featured are research pioneers and technological innovators such as John Logie Baird, inventor of the worlds first working television, and Andrew Ure, whose experiments on corpses are thought to have inspired Mary Shelleys novel Frankenstein.There is a towering mural of a telescope with a satellite hovering among the stars above. Another striking piece tells the story of the \"Land-Ship\", a mock navigation bridge that was used to teach students about the principles of compass adjustment.Just around the corner on High Street is one of the citys most popular murals. Painted by the Glasgow-based Australian artist Smug ndash real name Sam Bates ndash it shows a bearded man gazing tenderly at a robin perched on his finger.It depicts a modern-day version of Glasgows patron saint, St Mungo, and references the story of The Bird that Never Flew on the citys coat of arms.

Someone will tag it with graffiti ndash as happened to Klinges panda mural ndash or it can disappear altogether as in the case of Rogue-ones Hip Hop Marionettes when the building it adorned on John Street was demolished.While some may decry the transient nature of these installations, it is arguably something which could be viewed as a positive, reflecting the changing landscape as the city continually evolves and reinvents itself.\"One of the best parts is exploring bits of the city that you havent been to for ages,\" says Klinge. \"If there is a mural beside empty shop units, people doing the tour builds up passing trade and brings footfall to areas that there may not be regularly.\"Klinge, who has been liaising with Glasgow City Council, The Arches and Network Rail on his latest project, has grant funding for three portraits at the Midland Street site.

It is expected that all three murals will be completed by this weekend.\"My work has a dark aesthetic but the only stipulation for this job was to bring a bit of colour,\" he says. \"Each figure is sitting within a circle of colour and within that each colour for each figure will be dferent.\"\"I knew from a very early age that art was a career path I was going to pursue. Going into Glasgow on the train I would see graffiti along the side of the tracks and found that interesting to look at. Growing up I was inspired by hip hop culture, graffiti, rap, breakdancing and DJing.\"I have never done graffiti. I am not a graffiti artist. Im not even a street artist ndash I am just an artist. Street art, for me, is simply working to a much larger scale than I do in the studio.\"Because I use spray paint that does see me being pigeonholed as a graffiti or street artist, but even my canvas work uses spray paint. I work with stencils then I attack the canvas with a palette kne and move the paint around.\"Its not all glamour as Klinge can testy. Among his biggest foes: battling the elements. \"Working with stencils when it gets windy or rainy is a nightmare,\" he says. \"Theres been a couple of times Ive been rained off. You wake up in the morning, look out the window and hope for the best.\"Yet, these are merely minor grumbles. \"It is exciting,\" says Klinge. \"Even from when I was emulsioning the wall beforehand, I had people coming up and asking: Are you going to be doing a mural  When I said yes, they would get excited.

While enthusiasts say the stones are artistic, nature groups have warned against the practice.Others have been criticised for laying out food in an attempt to lure deer, red squirrels and birds of prey for pictures, while some Instagrammers ndash such as American so-called lsquoprofessional huntressrsquo visitor Larysa Switlyk created outrage after sharing images of a ram, goat and stag killed on a trip to Islay.Freelance landscape and travel photographer Ali Horne warns that a balance is required between encouraging visitors and retaining the uniqueness of beauty spots.ldquoTherersquos a tricky balance between promoting places which donrsquot have enough visitors and having too many, he says.ldquoI now avoid Skye in the summertime because the number of people means itrsquos too populated, and Irsquom becoming more conscious of what I am posting on social media, he adds.Andrew Macnair, of CalMac Ferries, says the maps are in response to rising demand. ldquoWhen we developed the idea of the maps, it was with the intention of using them online to help visitors to the island discover all the hidden gems Uist has to offer.ldquoHowever, the enthusiasm that has flooded into the tourism office for the products showed there was a demand to create a physical product.The maps cost pound and proceeds go to help the Royal National Leboat Institution .Robert McKinnon, Chief Executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, adds: ldquoSocial media has put the islands on the map, with so many Insta-friendly locations on our doorstep.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming visitors to Uist and seeing Instagram feeds fill with snapshots of their adventures on the islands."},{"url":null,"title":"cleaner-campervan-helps-highland-tourists-go-extra-mile","story":"Summer has brought an invasion of campervans and motorhomes to Scotlandrsquos usually open roads, occupying lay-bys, chugging along the NC, taking the Skye Bridge to the Fairy Pools and sprawling across at least two parking berths outside the local Co-op to stock up on supplies of Chardonnay and hand-cooked crisps.Find yourself staring at the back end of one ndash typically loaded with mountain bikes ndash while negotiating one of the countryrsquos narrow roads and you could be in for a long, frustrating journey.Campervan and motorhome sales and hires in Scotland are said to have rocketed in recent years as adventurous tourists seek to explore hard-to-reach areas and take control of where they visit, when and for how long they stay.Such is the demand for them that some campervan dealers are reporting seven-month waiting lists for certain bespoke vehicles.According to the most recent figures from the National Caravan Council,  saw a  per cent rise in the number of motorhomes registered in the UK, with an estimated , on the road at the time.Itrsquos a figure thatrsquos thought to have leapt even higher since then, fuelled by slick marketing for north coast road trip holidays and a new breed of tourist anxious to lower their carbon footprint by avoiding flying in favour of embracing nature on their own doorstep.However, concern is mounting that the trend for hitting the road means some may be inadvertently adding to the environmental crisis and even creating their own green calamity.Earlier this month, alarm over a ldquocampervan epidemic prompted one local councillor on the NC route to announce plans to log registration numbers of campers who flout prohibition notices by setting up camp at Dornoch beach.East Sutherland and Edderton councillor Jim McGillivray claimed the vans were taking up limited parking spaces in the area and causing hygiene problems, with ldquowild toileting a particular concern.Others have raised worries that self-sufficient campervans and motorhomes bring little financial benefits to the communities they visit.Meanwhile, soaring numbers heading to the Western Isles have previously prompted MSP Alasdair Allan to raise the suggestion of a ldquomotorhome levy on the vehicles, citing concerns over the space needed for locals on ferries as well as the impact on areas of natural beauty by drivers parking overnight on the machair, leaving litter, toilet waste and tyre tracks.Add to the mix the diesel emissions pumped out by motorhomes and campervans and the ldquohappy camper image of someone in touch with nature seems just a little at odds with reality.ldquoCampervans are a growing market, agrees Gary Hayes of Grangemouth-based Eco-Campers, which creates a new breed of hybrid campervans designed to be less environmentally toxic than their diesel-fuelled cousins.ldquoThere are lots of people lsquostaycationingrsquo, and lots of people want to explore their backyard.ldquoThere has been a phenomenal rise in campervan sales since  and the industry has also seen big changes. But we havenrsquot built a diesel campervan in two years.While an all-electric campervan would certainly tick a few ldquogreen boxes, issues such as finding a recharging spot in the middle of nowhere make their practicality tough for even the toughest of camper.Instead, Mr Hayes claims to have pioneered the next best thing ndash the worldrsquos first fully hybrid and ldquotribrid four-wheel-drive fully independent campervans, powered by low-emission petrol engines and a hybrid battery that also powers white appliances.The design removes the need for gas fuel and a V hook-up for power.

Environmental group Keep Scotland Beautul revealed this week that, while  Edinburgh parks had received green flag awards, Glasgow ndash the ldquodear, green place ndash got just three.The poor showing came on the back of complaints that places such as Kelvingrove Park, Maxwell Park and Victoria Park had become neglected, overgrown and unwelcoming to folk who believe strongly in lawn order.One such, Conservative councillor Kyle Thornton, accused Glasgow City Cooncil of giving complaints the rubber ear. He shrieked: ldquoWe use our parks to get fit, for parks runs, for children to play in during the school holidays ndash they are no usethe grass is overgrown.That is a good point well made, eventhis writer disagrees with all of these uses of parks: joggers, children and other hooligans should be kept out of them.Somewhat ingeniously, the cooncil said it was letting thegrass get overgrown to keep winos oot, as such ladies and gentlemen prefer manicured lawns on which to park their posteriors prior to getting blotto. Winos complainthat accompanying nibbles suchas dry roasted peanuts andTwiglets are easily lost in thelong grass, leading to malnutrition and a souring of the party atmosphere.The cooncil also averred that it was right into bioersity ndash ken  ndash and that it was encouraging ldquoessential pollinator species, which my translators tell me might mean bees.Itrsquos a measure of the enervating cynicism of our times that, having heard these explanations, the number of people believing the cooncil amounted to [counts fingers on each hand] hellip nil. Folk said it was just the usual cost-cutting, which saw Victoria Park have  of its  flower beds grassed over. Friends of Victoria Park described this as ldquoan act of civic vandalism.Upon which, Cooncillor Thornton piped up again, saying part of the problem was caused by the local authority redeploying parks staff to empty bins, something the cooncil did not deny.This is the nub of the problem: parks need staff dedicated to them orderlies based in situ who come to know and love each place and who are always on hand to deal with problems ndash such as joggers, children and winos ndash as they arise.Scottish local authorities love to centralise everything, so you get mobile teams of staff fetching up periodically to tend the parks in a more or less industrial manner, timed for efficiency, with whips cracking off their backs as theyrsquore exhorted to finish up and get to the next place. Even then, in Glasgow, they donrsquot seem to have been turning up at all.In happier times, when le was slower and public funding rarely a problem , each park would have a cleverly named ldquoparkie, who would pick up litter and scold peoplethey were acting in a slovenly or otherwise anti-social manner.One parkie could keep a whole park ticking over, perhaps abetted from time to time by the boys with the big mowers.Irsquove just had a gander at the cooncilrsquos ldquoParks  Green Spaces Vision, but only got so far before I started to gag on guff aboot ldquostakeholders and ldquovested interests. Parks are for everybody, apart from the aforementioned joggers, children and winos. They are good for the soul and the heid generally, particularly as the hurly burly is now hurlier and burlier than it has ever been.Winos could be kept out better by a parkie armed with a Taser and a big net, than by overgrown grass and jaggy nettles. As for children, they might be allowed in, provided they were kept on a leash. Same with joggers.Itrsquos time we entered a new era, loosely based on the old era, when parks were valued and had proud staff dedicated particularly to them.

Presumably, respondents all had a job and a roof over their heads.Even in the most jocund fun factories there always lurks a wandering Jeremiah. Earlier this month, Gary Smith, secretary of the GMB Union in Scotland, expressed a rather less ecstatic tone. In an interview in The Herald on Sunday he said: ldquoIt feels like a city that is in decline. Wersquove got public buildings in a state of decay ndash the Mitchell Library, the problems with the Peoplersquos Palace ndash the streets are absolutely filthy and wersquove got an epidemic of rats in large parts of the city. Too often the politicians are happy to hide behind this bluff and bluster about lsquopeople make Glasgowrsquo. The people of Glasgow deserve better than they are getting.Mr Smith cited public spending cuts and stealth privatisation as factors in many of Glasgowrsquos challenges. ldquoAll of this leaves the city in a state that feels unkempt, unloved and, in a lot of areas, actually really filthy. It is a city that is in economic and political decline.Those of us who have spent most of our lives living and working in Glasgow know which version of Glasgow is the authentic one. Lestyle surveys never extend to the sprawling neighbourhoods that lie to the north and east of the city. In these places multi-deprivation and health inequality remain among the worst in Europe, as they have been for more than a century. Many of Mr Smithrsquos union members live in these places. Until now the social challenges faced by these communities could be camouflaged in the breathless optimism of economic brochures selling an inward investment Xanadu to their fabled blue-chip companies.If they are proclaiming more than , businessesare located in the Glasgow city region and that they support more than , jobsthen they inadvertently paint a bleak picture. Why do so many Glaswegian families remain locked out of this economic Klondyke  No matter how spectacular a cityrsquos economic growth might be no matter how optimistic its long-term projections, these are shallow and meaninglesstens of thousands of people in the same old communities are unable to share in the bounty. Real growth and not this sham facsimile of it would trickle down into these places instead of accumulating in the bank accounts of the same few.Affluence and success can make you blind to the fact that Glaswegian men can lose  years of their le expectancy on a seven-mile stretch of the M from east to west. But when backdoor privatisation results in truncated essential services and a non-union workforce, the signs of decline begin to encroach on the city centre and the leafier neighbourhoods. Ultimately, tenants will pay more for additional services like bin collections. Rather than investing in these services they outsource to private firms, the least of whose concerns is the welfare of their workers and the cost to tenants. This is always how privatisation works.Meanwhile, the meter on Glasgowrsquos equal pay scandal is still running. The entire fabric of the city has been mortgaged to meet the bill, but this extends only to . The city will have to find more cash to pay those women who have been working since then at an unequal rate.Meanwhile, the sht and concentration of economic and political power to boutique Edinburgh continues.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sports centre serves up an ace with new tennis plans","story":"With the nation currently hooked on Wimbledon, it#s a fitting time for Garioch Sports Centre to unveil its new tennis-focused proposals.Inverurie Community Council has submitted fresh expansion plans to Aberdeenshire Council on behalf of Garioch Sports Holdings.Full planning permission was secured last year for a major extension of the Inverurie facility, but changes in the community’s requirements and pressures on funding have prompted a reduced development.Initially the plans would have seen the Burghmuir Drive centre expanding into one of the largest amenities of its kind in Scotland, incorporating tennis courts, a multi-sports arena, fitness suites and an all-weather G pitch for Inverurie Loco Works FC which has now been dropped.But while the scale of the expansion might not be as ambitious, the new plans do reveal tennis courts and improvements for fitness along with an Early Learning Centre for younger children.Thanks to signicant input from Judy Murray – mother of tennis stars Andy and Jamie – the plans feature three dedicated tennis courts and the centre has committed to a three-year partnership with the JM Foundation, highlighting the commitment of the centre to develop the sport across Garioch.The centre and JM Foundation will work in partnership in upskilling their workforce and identying potential coaches while funding coach education.In a supporting statement the centre writes: “The matter of securing the appropriate funding for the ious options which have been considered over the last couple of years has impacted upon how the plans have altered with the focus very much now being on the new tennis provision.“The most recent plans reflect the discussions with the Lawn Tennis Association and also Tennis Scotland.“The advice and guidance of Judy Murray has also been pivotal in how the plans particularly for the tennis courts have progressed.”The applicants also believe that despite the downturn in oil and gas and other industries, there is still a demand for its facilities.It reports: “As many of the activities and programmes now carry waiting lists, there is proof that despite a downturn in many industries the timing is now right to expand in tandem with the growth in participation and the increase in the town and rural residency.“An expansion of the present facility and delivery of its sporting, health and wellbeing activities has many positive additions as the market town itself strives to increase its provision to its residents.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..!

The schemes are designed to protect electricity consumers in the North of Scotland from high costs of distribution in their area. In   this was done by providing an annual assistance amount of £ million to consumers in the area, which Ofgem estimates is worth around £ per household.Mr McArthur said: “It is simply unfair for islanders to be surcharged when so many households in our island communities already experience the highest levels of fuel poverty anywhere in the country.“If these plans are implemented, it will be good news for consumers across the highlands and islands.

It also supports those living on the islands when travelling to and from the mainland for leisure and essential healthcare.”The move is the latest in a series of measures aimed at improving journeys for all travelers. Earlier this month the company became the first Scottish transport operator to introduce the pioneering Neatebox support service. This followed improvements to the NorthLink website, disability awareness training for staff, and a new partnership with a sign language interpreting agency.Mum and carer Jenny Whinnet, who helped to start the PAMIS campaign  years ago, said: #This is an exciting development for families and carers.#It permits people who need these facilities to travel further afield confidently and with dignity. This is very dferent to the early years of this campaign, when it was so dficult for me to travel with my son Craig because there were no Changing Places toilets available.”Jenny Miller, Chief Executive Officer of PAMIS added: “We’ve been very impressed with the commitment and consideration shown by Serco NorthLink Ferries in developing changing places toilets on their ferries.#They have really listened to the stories from the families and people we work with and who feel excluded from so many activities that we all take for granted. We’re delighted that the Orkney and Shetland ferries will be the first in the country, and possibly the world, to have a Changing Places toilet.”Paul Wheelhouse, minister for energy, connectivity and the islands is pleased to see the new facilities up and running.He said: #This type of improvement is exactly why we set up the Ferries Accessibility Fund.#We know accessible travel not only enables people to enjoy equal access to our beautul country, but it also enables people to fully participate in society and improve the quality of their lives, so we want to continue to identy and remove any disabling barriers which prevent people from making journeys or lead to them having an unpleasant time on board.#It’s very important that Scotland’s ferry services are fully accessible, offering the best passenger experience possible to everyone and this targeted investment marks very welcome progress on that journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It replaces outdated software applications or even paper-based systems and is the only product of its type available on the market.The simple and easy to use interface connects directly with employees in real time and offers the company a simple overview and analytics of the crew pool.NorthLink, has around  marine staff who, alongside the crewing department, will benefit directly from the innovation.Ankaa Ltd is a new company set up by marine specialist employment firm Clyde Marine Recruitment, which has been managing seafarers for almost four decades. NorthLink Ferries’ two freight vessels, Helliar and Hildasay, were instrumental in the product development and field testing.Ian Livingstone, managing director of Ankaa, said: “The maritime community has always been challenged with effectively managing, sharing and ensuring validity of seafarer’s data. This has become more dficult with tightening data privacy legislation globally. The maritime world has been slow to adopt digital solutions and reluctant to embrace collaboration. We were very frustrated with the products available on the market being unable to offer a user-friendly but complete approach to industry-wide problems. Ankaa Marine was specically designed by seafarers for seafarers to offer the sector a simple solution.”Stuart Garrett, Serco’s managing director for NorthLink Ferries, added: “We never stand still and are always looking for ways to improve our operations. Usually this is for the benefit of our customers. But on this occasion, we’re pleased to be doing something directly for our staff, ensuring that we keep up with technology and bring the benefits of digital services to our unique workplace. This is a proven solution to something that affects every maritime operator and we’re proud to be in at the start of a transformation in crew management.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In fact we’ve moved onto golf already with The Open set for ‘Moving Day’ at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland where players jockey for position ahead of the final day tomorrow.Last Sunday was the acid test for skilled televison remote control, ‘il telecomando’ operators like myself this was button-pushing at the highest level our very own World Cup Finalyou like. Judgement Day.Not exactly a duel in the sun to rival Jack Nicklaus versus Tom Watson in the scorching heat of Turnberry in , given that the curtains were closed and copious amounts of Maltesers had been taken – but you get the picture. A veritable feast of summer sport.It was a case of judging the breaks for Robinsons Barley Water in the Wimbledon Men’s final contested by Novak Djokovic and hunky slab of Swiss Toblerone Roger Federer, while switching between the cricket with Sky Sports providing a handy idiot’s guide as to how many runs England needed to win the World Cup.The tennis finished just in time for us soon-to-be-heartbroken Scots to skip channels to witness the spawniest of spawny occurrences at the cricket.The ball, thrown by a New Zealand fielder skudded off Ben Stokes bat as he was ing to get back to the crease, hurtled towards the boundary and England were awarded six instead of five runs by mistake. Aye right.This eventually ‘tipped the balance in their favour’ as the commentators on the telly are fond of saying and Lord’s exploded in a sea of ruddy-faced emotion.: Ben Stokes’ calm under pressure no surprise to former teacher: Novak Djokovic: I had to beat crowd and Federer to win finalAt this point, I must confess to knowing absolutely hee-haw about cricket so type “Ben Stokes and lucky bar steward” into Goggle and accept my sincere apologiesthe above explanation makes no sense.I’d compare this controversial incident to the Russian linesman deciding that Geoff Hurst’s shot had crossed the line in the  World Cup Final against Germany, which as you might have heard led to England winning the football World Cup. But like the Murphys, I’m not Bitter ... .Cue references to not needing Europe to win from serial twit Jacob Rees-Mogg and Piers Morgan goading the Americans who are as passionate as the English about cricket but call it baseball.The Formula One racing was also on for those of you who like watching guys with giant necks drive round in circles and our very own Lewis Hamilton sped to glory in the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. I’m aware that there’s also something called the Tour de France going on at the moment but that’s more of a transport issue than a sporting one.It beats me why anyone would want to cycle round France when they’ve got a perfectly decent state-owned railway system the SNCF, which takes all the hassle, what with chains coming off and having to swap your blood for dferent blood, out of the equation. Yes, I’ve enjoyed this momentous summer of sport – and a nod to the Women’s World Cup as well which caught the imagination and created new global stars like Megan Rapinoe, who stuck two fingers up to Donald Trumpet while sparking furious debate around the issue of equal pay. OK, that covers the ‘white, middle-aged man pays token appreciation to women’s sport’, part of the column.However, enough of this phoney war nonsense – the Iceman Cometh for such folly and frippery. For the Devil sends the beast with wrath. I am, of course, referring to the Scottish football season. Now when I say football season, I don’t mean the snobby fitba’ that they play in the Scottish Premiership awash with bevvy and betting sponsorship offering all you can drink corporate hospitality to Billy the Builder who’s done “awfy well for himself”. No, I’m talking about real football, the stuff in the lower leagues where the teams will be playing for the magnicently named Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup. How wonderfully Scottish is that I’m praying this provokes a reaction from garden furniture and traybake giant Dobbies who finally decide to flex their considerable financial muscle to sponsor the whole of Scottish football. One can only dream. The Dobbies UEFA Champions League. I love the relationship between Scottish football and food. It’s a central tenet of the game. Stuff like how we like to add salt to our already rather salty Bovril. Pass the salt again, will you.Then there’s the pies. I remember going to Sauchie a few years back to watch a junior game, nipping down for a half-time pie around the -minute mark only to be askedI’d ordered one.Turns out they operated a booking system similar to the theatre where you might tell the bar staff to put your gin and tonic on ice for the interval. I think this was to ensure the local supporters got their ‘meat’ and pastry content with monthly salt allowance in a oner.I’m all for forward-thinking but I don’t think it caught on – nearly caused a riot. Bless. I’ve already got the date pencilled in the calendar – Tuesday,  July. I will dutully head to Dundonald Bluebell to watch them play Bo’ness Utd in a Central Taxis league match. The Saturday after that I will take in my local team Crossgates Primrose. They’re big on flower power names in Fe.Alas, the bright lights of Methil or Cowdenbeath, where a higher standard of footballing fayre is on offer, are not for me folks.

They will ask the Shetland Islands Council to declare a climate emergency, as Orkney Islands Council did earlier this year. raquoWhat an amazing turnout, thanks to everyone who participated. 👏🏻🙌🏻As long as people in power put the value of money ahead of anything then we will never cease to destroying the planet until mother nature herself decides for us. For the le of the planet no amount of money can compare to what mother nature gives us.Earth#s nemesis is our banking systems and what they represent.As the Bibles says Timothy ,  # For the Love of Money is the root of all kinds of evil #.I#d very much like to read the rest of Johan Adamson#s comment but can#t find it here.Involving children in the spread of propaganda mirrors the ways of Chairman Mao and his #cultural revolution#. It is an increasing trend in UK and one we should surely reject.So, instead we should indoctrinate them in the ways of continued, pointless consumerism that is managing to waste resources and destroy the environment  Why is this behaviour any more #normal#  These are intelligent young people who know their own minds, ones who can be bothered to get up and make their voices heard.I didn#t advocate consumerism though. Children should not be pushed into anything, including consumption.The reason the older generation are skeptical, they#ve seen it all before.You#ve been reading the Mail again, Ali!For goodness sake, Brian, learn some basic simple science and stop the socialist dogma. Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point.

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We need to take it more seriously and that can’t come fast enough.”The EPA report found that the levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air in Dublin represents a possible public health risk and may be exceeding the annual limits deemed safe by the European Union.Ms Hourigan said the group will continue to hold protests until measures to combat air pollution are introduced.Urgent action is required...

They’ve been a very great ally of ours.”France and Germany joined condemnation of Iran’s actions, which have triggered concerns that it will lead to further oil price hikes amid heightened tensions in the Gulf involving Iran, the US and UK.Fears had been growing that the Iranian authorities were trying to seize a UK ship in retaliation for the seizure of the Grace  tanker off the coast of Gibraltar on July  in an operation involving Royal Marines.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A Royal Marine patrol vessel is seen beside the Grace  super tanker in Gibraltar The Grace  was suspected of violating EU sanctions by carrying a cargo of Iranian oil destined for Syria in breach of sanctions and Mr Hunt later offered to help release the vesselIran guaranteed it would not breach sanctions imposed on Bashar Assad’s regime.But Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the tanker’s seizure an act of “piracy” on Tuesday and warned the UK to expect a response.A statement from Stena Bulk said ship manager Northern Marine Management had lost contact with the crew of  after “unidentied small crafts and a helicopter” approached the vessel at about pm on Friday.The company said the tanker was in international waters at the time but appeared to be heading north towards Iran.Erik Hanell, president and chief executive of Stena Bulk, said: “There are  seafarers onboard of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality.Iran’s behaviour is unacceptable and they’ve got to release the shipJohn McDonnell“There have been no reported injuries and the safety and welfare of our crew remains our primary focus.

The Committee then asked architect William Barker to estimate the cost of the renovations to the old building as well as the cost of a plain new place of worship.Mr Barker’s financial quote for the construction project said that the revamp of the old church would cost £ and a new church would be £,. To put the overall estimate into perspective, today the combined  figure of just over £, would be worth over £,.The records of Burt Presbyterian Church show that a Committee meeting on February ,  it was decided upon the casting vote of Rev Ross to abandon the renovation scheme and the idea of building a new church was then put before the congregation at a meeting on February , .The go-ahead for the new building was dependent upon the congregation subscribing an additional £ more than they had already promised. When that was agreed by the congregation, plans to construct the new church were given the green light for the year .Financial pressure on the project was immediately eased when Lord Templemore subscribed the entire £, but further collections were made in Derry, Newtoncunningham, Crossroads, Raphoe, Strabane, St Johnston and Carrigans, Knowhead, Fahan and Inch.Rev Ross himself reported back that he had gathered another £ in Belfast and Lisburn.With the money in place, William Barker was tasked to prepare plans for a meeting house that could accommodate  people, to have a plain roof, double windows, buttressed walls finished with cement dashing and windows with cement plaster. The church pews were to be pitch pine with walnut top rails.The location of the new church, it was decided, was to be in the upper corner of the ground filled by the old building with the entrance door facing the present gateway in line with the entrance of the old meeting house. Two Porrett stoves sunk in each aisle were to provide the heating.The lineage of Presbyterianism in Burt is one that stretches back over three-and-half centuries. But, as the city of Derry began to grow after the Plantation of Ulster, the Presbyterians of Burt travelled there. In the city at this time, Episcopacy, or the governance of the church by a clerical hierarchy was established by law. But, services were conducted at St Columb’s Cathedral and St Augustine’s Church on the walls to suit the views of Presbyterians.Back in , a Presbyterian minister in Derry was deposed for failing to conform to the views of the Episcopacy and another  fled from the city to avoid being imprisoned.By , the Presbyterian Congregation in Derry was still languishing when attempts were begun to bring preachers over from Scotland.As evidence of the persecution of those of the Presbyterian tradition, a William Hampton, who had been brought into the city by Presbyterians such as Campsie, Burnside and Early was implicated for preaching at a large meeting house which they had built within the city’s walls and just a few yards away from the mansion of the established church’s Bishop.This ‘affront’ to the Anglican tradition could no longer apparently be tolerated by the church authorities.On Sunday, September , , the Bishop decided to take action and with the Mayor, a judge, the city’s Sherrf and other officers they visited the meeting house where they found the Presbyterian congregation praying with William Hampton.It was recorded that they were: “Praying and preaching openly, and not according to the established Liturgy and order of the Church of Ireland.”A “riotous” confrontation took place, the leaders arrested and the church was promptly shut down. This situation continued until August ,  when devoid of anyone to lead them in prayer, the Derry Presbyterians asked for Hampton’s services until another preacher could be appointed.In , Rev Robert Rule of Kirkcaldy in Scotland accepted a call to minister in Derry and was installed that year.Some  years before Rev Ross set foot in Burt and application was made to the Presbytery of Laggan by an Alderman of Derry, John Craigie and a merchant, Mr John Fisher together with William Cunningham of Burt to ide the Parish of Templemore into two congregations. This came about in  and the previously pilloried Rev William Hampton ed from Scotland and was ordained at Carnamaddy on October  that year.Another  odd years later, there was a dispute over parish boundaries within the Presbytery of Derry when in  the people of Elagh, Coshquin and Ballynagalliagh refused to belong to Derry. But, it took until January , for the Synod to order “that the liberties of the City on that side of the water wherein the City standeth should be the bounds of the Congregation.”It seems the Burt people weren’t happy with that decision and appealed it, but without success.Another point of interest about Presbyterianism in Burt is that in  the worshippers from Inch who had attended Burt since  formed their own congregation under the Derry Presbytery. The mode of transport to Burt from Inch Island had always been boats. It’s said that on Sunday’s someone sat at a window in the Gallery of Burt church watching the tide and when it was just right, the person stood up and announced that ‘the Inch folk may go now.’During the -year ministry of Rev Robert Graythe old church had fallen into a state of disrepair. There were no pews and the aisles were covered by cold flagstones. But, previous to that there was only an earthen floor and no heating at all.In , the church had a new roof and ceiling installed. Prior to that it was recorded that it was a common thing for the rain to pour down on the heads of the congregation.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshNevertheless, the Presbyterian denomination in the district was flourishing. In , the Parish of Burt had , Presbyterians,  people belonging to the Church of Ireland and , Catholics.When it came time to finalise the plans for the new church under the watch of Rev Ross in , the final estimate of William Barker was £, and tenders for the construction project were advertised on April .Three bids were received. One came from R Colhoun in Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for its boundary wall. Another came from Joseph Colhoun, also from Derry who bid £, for the church and £ for the boundary wall. The final tender came from Matthew McClelland from the city who tendered £, for the church and £ for the wall, who having made the lowest bid won the contract.It was agreed that contractor was bound to have the house roofed, the outside of the walls finished and the windows installed by September ,  and ready for opening by March , .In the presence of shirt industry magnate, William Tillie, the High Sherrf of County Derry and many members of the congregation and people from the surrounding area, the foundation stone was laid on July , .The builder, Joseph Colhoun presented Mr Tillie with an inscribed silver trowel to lay the stone and a sealed bottle acted as a time capsule which inside were placed copies of the Derry Standard, the Derry Journal, Londonderry Sentinel, Northern Whig, Missionary Herald, Christian Banner, a photo of the old church and some coins. Lunch was provided for the dignitaries in the lecture room which was highly decorated with flowers and plants.The contract deadline was narrowly missed and the church opened in early May, .The opening services on Sunday, May ,  were conducted by the then Moderator of the General Assembly, Rev Dr G Buick from Cullybackey and the following week by Rev William Colquhoun of Fitzroy Avenue, Belfast. The minister’s room and toilet in the church as well as the pulpit and choir  were provided as gts by Mrs JB Mullin of Buncrana who was the sister of Rev Ross and the we of John Brice Mullin the Deputy Lieutenant of County Donegal.Fundraising events for the upkeep of the church were however still of course necessary. In , it was reported that Rev Ross organised a very successful Sale of Work and Summer Fete which were held on July ,  and  that year.The events took place in the Lecture Hall and a marquee in the church grounds and began at .pm each day. The proceedings were opened on July  by Mrs McMaster of College Avenue in Derry and the Mayor of Derry, Alderman JP Thompson oversaw the events.There was an Empire Work Stall, a Shamrock Work Stall, a Provision stall, a Sweet Stall, a Children’s Stall and Refreshment Stall. The Amusement Committee organised a large number of competitions that included shooting events. On the nights of the  and  July, a iety concert took place in the Lecture Hall. Over the three days, a firm called Neely’s operated a sidecar service ferrying people from Bridgend Railyway Station to the church and back again. The combined rail and admission ticket cost d and a specially laid on train took people back to Derry from Bridgend each night at .pm.The funds raised in July,  helped to renovate the Lecture Hall and other church buildings and to properly lay out the church grounds.As with many other congregations of all denominations across Ireland, the First World War impacted upon Burt Presbyterian Church. To reflect this, in August of  the Church Committee proposed to obtain an organ and a Memorial Tablet at the entrance of the church.Three of the congregation, John Buchanan, Stewart Buchanan and Joseph Downey were killed between -. And, in October  it was reported that £ had been collected for the organ and the memorial. The tablet was unveiled on Sunday, January ,  by Mrs Bowen, we of Colonel William Bowen DSO and the preacher on this occasion was Captain Rev WP Hall and a Guard of Honour travelled to Burt from Ebrington Barracks in Derry for the event. The tablet also remembered  more men and women from Burt congregation who had served in WWI.After the Great War and the partition of Ireland in , many of the working-class families connected to Burt Church moved into Derry city and other part of the North and many more who had served in the war had not ed to the area as work was scarce in this era. The drop in numbers within the congregation was reflected by the names recorded in the Communion Roll Book between -.Rev R W Ross resigned from active duty as Minister of Burt Presbyterian Church on July ,  and he died aged  at the City and County Infirmary in Derry on Sunday, July  after a long illness. The Church Session and Committee met later that day and paid tribute to the long and diligent service that had he had given.A deputation from the church was due to travel to Belfast the next day to meet with the Presbyterian Union Commission and they went ahead with the plans despite Mr Ross’ death as there would not an opportunity for another meeting for at least another two months.The Union Commission was proposing that Burt and Netwoncunningham congregations should be amalgamated under one minister, but the Session and Committee of Burt flatly rejected the suggestion.In June of  the Committee looked at the issue of enquiring at the price of a memorial for the late Rev Ross and a stained glass window and in February of  a Mr Haslett submitted sketches for a memorial tablet and his proposals were accepted. The memorial tablet was unveiled by Rev Ross’ widow Bessie on Sunday, June , .Rev Robert William Ross had married Bessie in  and in his will left a total of £ s d. He was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Upon her husband’s passing Bessie lived firstly at Castlehill Road, Belfast and later at Bognor Regis and then Pallant, Chichester. Following her death on July ,  she was buried there. Bessie bequeathed a total of £, s d to her two sons, Leslie Norman Ross and Arthur Gordon Ross, who were both doctors.A third son, George Harold Ross was born on May ,  in Derry. George was educated at Campbell College in Belfast and began a career in banking after emigrating. He enlisted in the th Canadian Battalion at the rank of Liuetenant on November ,  and later transferred to the th Canadian Battalion.  He saw action at the Somme in July,  and in April,  at Vimy Ridge where he was wounded and suffered injuries to his left femur and left foot. He was demobilised in July,  and ed to Canada where he became a farmer.CAPTION: The Reverend Robert William Ross."},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group says opportunity lifetime north west must seized","story":"The Derry University Group say that civic society has a responsibility to future generations to seize this opportunity to build a new, dedicated university in the North West.A spokesperson for the group told the Derry News: “This is the opportunity of a letime.

We have an opportunity here to create a legacy that will endure for centuries.”The spokesperson added that the North West must immediately begin revising its current ‘tenuous’ development plans so as to accommodate a new university.“It is a matter of great concern that so much of this region’s future planning centres on promises made by Ulster University, an institution controlled in Belfast and Coleraine, which has consistently failed Derry and northwest Ireland – and has broken promise after promise to this city - over the past six decades.“As regards the long-term planning of the region, it is not acceptable that we do build and deliver our own alternative. Derry and the North West have the capability, the determination and the vision to deliver a better future for ourselves.“It is reckless and perilous to remain entirely dependent on outside institutions that will always, by necessity, serve their own interests and those of their friends first. Why should we continue to acquiesce to those who have failed us, misled us and ultimately alienated us over six dferent decades ”The spokesperson added that a new Derry-centred institution, with a cross-border element under the auspices of the National University of Ireland, could help militate against the impact of Brexit.“Derry Strabane Council needs, as its first priority, to re-draft its City Deal to ensure that it can include a new independent university as its new anchor partner.“Council also needs to engage pro-actively with the Dublin and London governments to enact supporting legislation, and to secure resources, funding other support and accreditation for this new dedicated institution for the North West.“The positive momentum is there.

The committee was headed by Lockwood, who was an English academic. He produced a report on a second university for Northern Ireland he recommended not Londonderry but Coleraine.“Runner-up to Coleraine was the city of Armagh. It was not a sectarian decision it was made by an impartial English academic. It is slanderous to suggest that he was sectarian.”However, alluding to successive decades of underinvestment Mr Adonis yesterday told the Derry News: “No matter what the motives behind these decisions were, the result is that Derry has unfairly lost out and its young people deserve better.“The past should not govern the future. Yet the situation is getting worse not better.”Figures gathered by the Derry News under Freedom of Information legislation, and published last month, show that student numbers in the city actually fell from , in   to , in  .This comes at the same time UU created a new and much larger campus in Belfast city centre at a cost of £-m. The university has attributed a reduction in student numbers and “expansion challenges” in Derry to higher education budget cuts.At Monday’s debate, Baroness OLoan defended Ulster University’s position insisting that the building infrastructure at Jordanstown was not capable of being sustained leaving it with no option but to relocate.UU’s decisionWhile, Lord Empey, a former leader of the UUP, and Minister responsible for further and higher education who dealt with Ulster University at somesaid he supported the proposition of a medical school in Derry.However, he added that the decision of where to invest was down to the university alone and UU “made very clear to us what it wanted to do. It said: we want to rebuild our Jordanstown campus and put it in the centre of Belfast. Will you support us or not “It was not a question of Londonderry versus Belfast—that option was not open. It had made its decision.”Meaningful change can be brought about as a result of this report which, Mr Adonis says, is a signicant first step towards increasing student numbers in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a new university with its principal campus in Derry - \"I hope action will follow,” he added.“It is realistic to believe that Derry can have a standalone university since it is the norm for cities the size of Derry across the UK to have universities of their own. Derry is unusual only in being so acutely disadvantaged. It is scandalous that this issue was not addressed years ago.”Askedhe will continue to advocate on Derry’s behalf, he added: “Absolutely! I will follow the government’s report in September closely and continue to push for Derry to have a university with its principal campus in the city. This has to happen.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"john dunne appreciation life one natures gentlemen","story":"When John Dunne passed away almost three months ago on May , with him went one of the last remaining links to the original staff of St Joseph’s Boys School in Creggan.In recent years John was an utterly familiar sight on the edge of the city’s Bogside as he made his way into town. But, that short daily journey must have taken as least twice as long as it would have taken anyone  simply because almost everyone he passed knew him, stopped him and engaged in conversation with him.On the th anniversary of the school’s opening in  I was asked to help compile a book to mark the occasion. When I sat down to write a list of those who would have to be interviewed, John Dunne was the first name on the top of the pile.When I started to transcribe John’s interview it began like this: “In this era of media created ‘stars’, famous for nothing more than seeking fame-or infamy, in many cases-the tag of legend is one that is all too easily doled out.“Most people in their formative years can point to a mentor who influenced them greatly and provided knowledge and encouragement when these vital commodities were often all too scarce. More often than not, these people are unassuming and go about their lives in the same manner.“These people are society’s real legends and in the history of St Joseph’s, fewany, earned that accolade more than John Dunne.”That chapter of the book on St Joseph’s was entitled ‘One of nature’s gentlemen’, and there’s absolutely no reason to change that title for the purposes of this appreciation of John Dunne’s le because in my opinion its accuracy cannot be upgraded in any way.‘Big John’ as he was affectionately known to all former pupils of the school, made a positive mark on thousands of young lives in his four decades at St Joseph’s. It would be hard to find anyone that would disagree that the word big when applied to John Dunne not only represented his physical stature but also his intelligence and patience.By , the Dunne family had lived at Brandywell Road, Burnfoot and then back to Derry and more specically the newly developing Creggan estate.John Dunne began his career at St Columb’s College in  in the company of contemporaries such as Nobel laureates John Hume, Seamus Heaney.In  he told me: “I enjoyed the time at St Columb’s without really realising or wondering what le was about. There were people then who went back up to the College at six o’clock and studied until nine o’clock.“But, I and another man, Bill Smyth, who also ended up teaching at St Joseph’s, instead of going to the school, followed a great interest we had discovered-greyhounds. That was our main pursuit. Strangely, we both also ended up training as teachers at St Joseph’s College in Belfast which was linked to Queen’s University but separate in that it awarded its own accreditation.”It was at training college that John Dunne encountered a dilemma. Already well-known for his ability as a footballer, his lelong passion, he had to make the choice of whether he would pursue as a career as PE teacher.“I had distinct limitations, because when I was very young, I nearly died twice. When I was six months old and again when I was five, I caught pneumonia. I remember the second time and having to lie from about December to April before I came around.“I was in a sort of comatose state for a long time, but my mother God rest her, battled away and I survived. But, it left me severely limited in terms of stamina. In terms of pace, I was very quick off the mark, but I couldn’t sustain it. And, the further up you went in football, the more of a problem it became. I loved reserve football, but the full senior game was just too fast for me,” he said.In September  John began his teaching career at the newly opened St Joseph’s Secondary School in Creggan for the princely sum of £ per month. It was here that he spent the entire span of his professional le.The new school with its emphasis educating those who had not successfully navigated the old  plus exam, it was a ready-made home for John Dunne and many of his contemporaries alike. Like many of his era, John benefitted from easier access to grammar school system because of post-war changes to British education policy. But, also like many of his generation, John spoke candidly about his reservations on it. His words also revealed why he preferred the non-selective route through school.“The thing about going to St Columb’s is that we weren’t completely accepted. We were dferent somehow. The boarders who stayed there were the ‘real’ St Columb’s boys as far as the clergy were concerned.“There are things now that are still etched in my memory. Where I lived, there was a protest after a child lost a leg having been hit by a bus. The people were worried about the safety of their children so they weren’t prepared to let the bus keep travelling that route.“Anyhow, the protest could be seen from the College. A priest, who shall remain nameless said, ‘well, what would you expect from people like that ’“We took great umbrage at that. I had been through a kind of elitist system at St Columb’s, where you had to prove yourself in the first place by getting so many marks in an  plus exam, in English and Maths-and they weren’t easy. They were quite dficult examinations. I went to the Christian Brothers at they drilled us kept us on in the afternoon for an hour, got us up on Saturday mornings and drilled us and drilled us.“When I went to teach in a secondary school it was very dferent. You had children there that for one reason or another had fallen through the system. They hadn’t perhaps done themselves justice in the system that surrounded them. In my time at St Joseph’s there were children who should not have been there because they could not get anything out of the system at all, no matter how much we tried or how much sympathy we had for their position. But we did try.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I had been through a system where I met good teachers, people who had made a good impact on my le. So, what I did when I saw what they were doing was imitate them. I wove all the goodness in other people into a fabric that I could use myself, and I found that it worked,” said John.At the end of John Dunne’s first decade as a teacher, the Troubles erupted on the streets of his native city. St Joseph’s geographical location meant that major disturbances often encroached upon the school itself. It befell people like John Dunne to provide a calm backdrop to the mayhem outside the gates of St Joseph’s.In  he said: “It was a very, very strange environment to be working in, because all hell could have broken loose in the immediate vicinity of the school at any time. There were teachers out on the streets, acting as buffers, trying tom keep a lid on things.“In practical terms, I found it very hard because in summer time it was very hot and you had to open the windows to let a bit of air in. But, there were helicopters flying about and the noise was unbearable and the youngsters couldn’t hear you. A lot of young people became involved and some of them lost their lives as a consequence.”Apart from a very quick but understated wit, John Dunne was blessed with a fantastic voice, full of dramatic intonation, that would have been the envy of many stage actors.As a teacher of the English language John had the ability the bring the most boring text to le and kept his students enthralled. He could have been reading the contents of the back of a cereal box aloud, but when he spoke people listened.The ability to relate a story, complete with an array of accents when required, was one that he credited his grandfather John Downey with.“He was a great storyteller. I remember as a young boy he used to take me early in the morning for his pension. We used to go to Mass about seven or eight o’clock and then go to the train station on the Strand Road and out to Bridgend for his pension and then visit people in the area.“But when we were walking, he always told me stories about haunted houses, about what kind of flowers were at the side of the road.“There seemed to be no end to his knowledge and then he could deviate and tell me another yarn. I just thrived on his stories.“I think also it was the way I was taught at the Christian Brothers. They were very precise about language. It’s become too loose now. People are very loose, especially when using mobile phones.“I’ve even read about the use of the apostrophe being lost. I was taught these things were important when you wrote something. I stuck to it and I tried to instil it into youngsters without being overly heavy about it.”John Dunne’s dulcet tones were employed again when Derry City FC re-entered senior football in  and for many years after he commentated on many of the games played by his beloved Candystripes.This interview with John Dunne was conducted in  at Pilot’s Row community centre. At this stage he had been retired from teaching for almost two decades. But, the huge capacity that he had to retain swathes of information was still very much evident.Asto prove that very thing, in the later stages of this conversation a young boy, no more than ten or eleven years old walked past and said cheerily, ‘hello John!’Without blinking an eye, John Dunne recounted the boy’s family history and how many of his relatives attended St Joseph’s. That was proof that you could take the man away from St Joe’s, but not St Joe’s away from the man.The interview with John Dunne ended with him speaking about the five decades since the school opened.He said: “It’s been some fty years, especially for somebody like me who has finished up living in the Bogside. When I got here, I was a little bit apprehensive about being someone who worked in St Joseph’s and being accepted into the local community. But, it’s no bother. I am on first name terms with people.“I was walking over to Mailey’s pub one night in the summer about .. It was a beautul night. There was a group of young men sitting in a garden. I was walking in the middle of the road and one of them came out and addressed me by my name.“He said, ‘John, there are not many teachers that could do what you are doing and walked through this area untouched.“That’s good to know I said.”CAPTION: The late John Dunne."},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wN1xcXC8xOTE1NTE1N1xcXC9PZmZsZWFkLTEtcGljLTEwMjR4NzY4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjMyN2UwOTU4ZjdmMDJhNzUzYmRkMDJmYWZiY2ZiZTRjNDY2ZjhmZjUifQ==/offlead-1-pic-1024x768.png","title":"rare breed star cahir launches annual agricultural show","story":"A young boy from Dungiven has helped to launch this weekend’s Co Londonderry and Limavady Agricultural Show.Young Cahir McGilligan, who found fame on the recent series of UTV’s Rare Breed, was on hand to launch the show which takes place tomorrow, Saturday, July .Avid farmer Cahir was delighted to be able to help out and is looking forward to participating himself.The annual show, which will be held at Aghanloo, Limavady, will see a number of events taking place throughout the day.These include horse and pony showing and jumping working hunter classes.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshLivestock showingand a fencing competition will also take place.Other attractions include home industries, crafts, vegetables and flowers, fun and games and numerous trade stands and young farmers tug of war.Updates can be found on their Facebook page.Cahir McGilligan is pictured above with the Chairman Mr Alwyn McFarlane and Mr Stanley Warnock who want to encourage everyone to attend the show for a great family day out.  "},{"url":null,"title":"springtown camp monument officially unveiled next month","story":"A monument commemorating the Springtown Camp in Derry will be officially unveiled next month at a ceremony near the entrance to the former site it has been announced.The unveiling will take place on Thursday, August  adjacent to the North West Regional College Training Centre at  noon and will be followed by a Civic reception at the Guildhall at pm.The art installation will take the form of a Nissan hut in which the inhabitants of the camp were forced to live in deplorable conditions because of a policy of housing discrimination in operation at the time against the Catholic community.Springtown Camp was originally a Second World War United States military installation which was vacated after the end of the conflict in the mid-s. Over  families once inhabited Springtown Camp and occupied it around  because of over-crowded living conditions in Derry.The decision to squat in the former military huts, despite the fact there was no electricity, running water or means of heating, came after many families evaluated that these conditions were actually better than they were enduring.The camp became a focal point of the early civil rights agitation in Derry.Willie Deery, who grew up in the camp, said: “This monument is vital because the camp symbolises the precursor to the civil rights marches.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It’s also somewhat ironic because  years after our mother’s were evicted from the Guildhall for protesting against the conditions at the camp there will now be a civic reception for us there.“This will be a recognition for our parents who had to raise their children in shocking circumstances. It will be an emotional day for us all. It’s not just about me, there were many hundreds of families with stories to tell but maybe I told mine a bit more forcefully.”In the coming days a crane will lt the one-third scale replica of a Nissan hut into place which were originally constructed out of iron welded together and covered in corrugated tin sheets.In , over  residents from the camp marched on the city’s Guildhall to lodge their complaints about their living conditions with the leaders of the old Londonderry Corporation as part of a long running battle with the former local authority.Willie Deery continued: “There is a famous Derry Journal photograph from November  when women from the camp marched on the Guildhall in protest after a fire. The mother’s in that picture are all gone but we are going to recreate that photo with their daughter’s standing in the same formation as the original picture.”CAPTION: An artists impression of what the monument to Springtown camp will look like after its installed."},{"url":null,"title":"statistics reveal missed targets department concedes ambulance service currently resourced","story":"The department of health has conceded that the current level of demand on the ambulance service exceeds available resources.The ambulance service has been dealing with a surge in emergency calls over recent years.Newly published Department of Healthstatistics reveal that between   and  , the number of emergency calls received by the NIAS increased by , from , to ,.In   the Western Local Commissioning Groupalone, which takes in Derry, received , calls – almost  a day.Aside from the Belfast LCG, the ambulance service in the Western area received the highest number of calls in the past year based on per ,-population.Category A calls are immediately le threatening and receive the NIAS’s highest priority with a performance target of arriving at .% of these calls within  minutes.During the last five years in NI, the percentage of Category A calls responded to within  minutesdecreased from .% in   to .% in  In   all LCGs fell well below this target, with the Western Trust the second-best performer at just .%.From December  to March  the performance across Northern Ireland has deteriorated.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in ..

It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain. The only way forward out of this mess is to let the people have the final say on any deal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
