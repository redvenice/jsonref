This is despite social care being in the top priority group for the rollout.Uptake is much higher among doctors and nurses, with 93 per cent of frontline staff now immunised.Ministers are discussing plans to force NHS workers to have Covid jabs. On Wednesday the Mail revealed that a review of vaccine passports will consider whether health staff who decline an injection could be legally obliged to have one.The review is also expected to look at whether compulsion should apply to care home staff, most of whom are not employed by the state.   NHS bosses have written to all local authorities asking them to focus efforts on boosting vaccination rates in social care. Yesterday, in a cross-party intervention, a group of 150 BAME councillors from both Conservative and Labour Parties joined forces to urge people to get the jab.The campaign has received the backing of Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer as well as vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Videos from councillors produced as part of the campaign have been seen over one million times.The campaign seeks to encourage people not only to take the vaccine but also to have important conversations with loved ones and relatives about getting the protection they need from the virus.Tory Cllr Gurjit Kaur Bains, who is leading the drive, said: \u0027As elected councillors we understand our communities and throughout this pandemic have been helping to provide support to our most vulnerable.\u0027This initiative is cross party because we all have a duty to protect our communities and fight misinformation.

Dr Benjamin Killingley, a scientist advising the UK Government in the pandemic, has also said wearing two masks was \u0027common sense\u0027.Public Health England\u0027s Dr Susan Hopkins told a Downing Street press conference this week the \u0027more layers you have the better\u0027. The comments have likely caused Britons to question the effectiveness of their current face masks. However, millions of people may unknowingly be wearing double or triple layer masks already.Many commercially available cloth masks are at least double or triple layered, while disposable surgical masks are usually made of three layers of non-woven fabric.The Government also has advice on its website on how to create your own double layered face masks from scratch with two pieces of cloth.Separate modelling by the Fugaku computer in September showed plastic face shields allowed nearly 100 per cent of tiny airborne droplets released by Covid-infected patients to escape through visors. And half of larger droplets measuring 50 micrometres in size — given off by coughs and sneezes — found their way into the air, posing a risk to others. One micrometre is one millionth of a metre.The World Health Organization (WHO) says face shields can help prevent the virus from spreading.But the agency says they only work in combination with other safety measures such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and frequent hand-washing.Face shields do not completely cover the entirety of the face, leaving room for droplets expelled by the mouth and nose to escape.Face visors are also worn by doctors, nurses and other hospital workers on the Covid-19 frontline, but with the addition of a fitted surgical face mask. It comes after research published last summer suggested home-made face coverings need to be at least two layers and preferably three to curb the spread of Covid-19.The study, published in the journal Thorax in July, saw experts from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, test three types of masks.Their one-layer face covering was made using a cotton T-shirt material, the two-layer covering was prepared by sewing two strips together, and the third was a surgical mask.The researchers concluded that while a single-layer face covering is better than none at all, a double-layer was \u0027significantly better at reducing the droplet spread caused by coughing and sneezing\u0027.They added: \u0027A surgical mask was the best among all the tested scenarios in preventing droplet spread from any respiratory emission.\u0027Another popular technique, particularly in America, is to wear a respirator mask - such as an N95 mask - and a cloth mask at the same time.N95 respirator mask are designed to have a close fit and filter airborne particles, with an electrostatic charge that can trap matter.President Biden has often been seen using a N95 mask and a paper or cloth covering on top.However, the US President explained during the election campaign that he struggles to get a medical grade N95 mask to fit comfortably.Therefore he wears a paper one over the top to keep it in place."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/24/10/4E885C6E00000578-0-image-a-8_1532422849650.jpg","title":"Third clip Prince Harry Meghan Markles Oprah trailer released today","story":"Share this articleShare this articlePalace ‘fears Meghan will make more claims against the Firm’ | News | The TimesBuckingham Palace yet to contact Sussexes about bullying inquiry | Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex | The GuardianDuke and Duchess of Sussex expect to be notified if formal bullying allegations are madeAt least 10 ex-aides of Meghan Markle and Harry \u0027queuing up\u0027 to assist bullying probe -

Here, the award-winning further education teacher discusses how she only wishes she started soonerWhen she left school at 16 with one GCSE, Misk Sharif Ali couldn’t have imagined that one day she’d be a silver award winner in the Pearson National Teaching Awards. She was recognised last year, in the further education lecturer of the year category, for her commitment to changing the lives of her students. “I was just speechless when I was told,” she says. “It was overwhelming.”The ICT teacher’s journey to the front of the classroom has been anything but straightforward. Sharif Ali grew up on what she describes as “the worst estate in north London” and she would skip school to look after her four younger siblings or to help her mum.“I learned how to work the system,” she says about turning up just enough not to raise alarm bells, or intercepting the post before it arrived at home. “My mind wasn’t always on education. I learned to annoy teachers so that I would get kicked out of class and could go home. I was argumentative and sarcastic, and they couldn’t handle me.“I can spot those tricks in my students now because I’ve been through it,” she adds. “When a student sits in front of me when they come to enrol at the college, especially the ones who’ve been through something similar or been kicked out of school, I always picture myself. They’re trying to paint a picture, they’ve rehearsed lines. They’re saying what they think I want to hear. I can always tell.”It was only her ICT teacher, she says, who took the time to try to understand and to encourage her. “He said: ‘Well done, that was amazing!’ about something I did one day. I never missed any of his classes after that. That was the one GCSE I got.”Returning home after spending a year living in Yemen with her grandparents, she started a part-time job at an optician’s and tried to enrol in further education. With few qualifications, she struggled to find somewhere that would accept her until she visited City of Westminster College, a further education college in central London. “I told the tutor a bit about myself and she gave me a chance, enrolling me on to a BTec level 2 course in ICT.” After progressing on to level 3 and graduating with distinctions and merits, she went to university to study complementary medicine (rather than her beloved ICT, as her family did not approve of it).Training to become a teacher hadn’t crossed her mind, and she was considering qualifying as an optometrist until a chance encounter on a train. “I helped an elderly lady send a text message to her son. She was so grateful that I thought I might enjoy teaching older adults about technology.” Later she researched routes into teaching and came across the diploma in education and training. It was during a placement at Newham College in east London, as part of the course, that she fell in love with working with teenagers.Some of those first students, when interviewed by Pearson for the recent awards, described Sharif Ali as “empowering, positive and encouraging”, “very unique” and “one of the best teachers I‘ve ever had”. “She never gives up,” one said. “That makes me look up to her. She believes in me.” She helped a student with issues he was having organising a flat with the council, another who was struggling with their mental health, and stayed at college late to help with assignments, even if they were set by other teachers. Some students said they were about to give up, but she encouraged them to keep fighting.“Giving them time is really important,” Sharif Ali says about her approach in the classroom. “I try to bring laughter, warmth, enjoyment to every class so my students don’t feel they are in a lesson. I want them to feel like they’re safe, and to steer them towards making a positive change through my own failures and accomplishments.”Having finished her diploma in education and training in 2015, she went on to complete her qualified teacher learning and skills certification three years later, and has almost completed a master’s in education.“I probably should have gone into teaching a long time ago,” she says. “While sometimes it feels like a job that never finishes, you never really switch off, and it can be very, very challenging – I always look forward to going to work. I love what I do. Education isn’t always about what’s in a textbook. It’s about having a teacher who believes in you. I believe in all of my learners, regardless of where they come from. And part of my job is making them realise their worth, too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/567147de5064132c6e1a250adb582530faa719b6/1_0_6072_3644/master/6072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705f9f2e756fea01dc4a05791a9e28d7","title":"why i teach i know the impact a great teacher can have on a child","story":"For Emmanuel Awoyelu, once an excluded pupil, becoming a teacher was a deeply personal journey – and one he never imagined takingWhen I think about my school experience, there are few positives I can take from it. By the time I left secondary school, I had already experienced two exclusions. Consequently, I left with only four A-C GCSEs and very little idea of what I would do with my life. As the eldest of three children, the weight I felt on my shoulders to succeed was immense. And the feeling of disappointment was even greater. My parents, who immigrated from Nigeria in the 80s, were incensed at how I was wasting my golden ticket to a better life. For them, education was vital because back home it was a luxury their families couldn’t afford.I had many difficulties in school I struggled to engage in particular lessons and often felt a lack of motivation. Admittedly, I was a class clown, and almost definitely used my humour and buffoonery at the wrong time on one too many occasions.The one shining light was Ms Sponge. She was my English teacher for much of secondary school and very quickly became my “school mother”. It was a running joke that I was the teacher’s pet a title I earned not because I was a goody two-shoes – quite the opposite. I was cheeky, humorous, and sometimes loud, but Ms Sponge never made me feel in the wrong. Instead, she helped me discover a love of writing. By calling me up to read in front of the class or asking me to share my stories, she created an arena for me to excel and did what no other teacher was capable of – seeing beyond my defence mechanism of being a class clown and bringing out the best in me. In her class, I read and wrote stories and acted in plays that were far removed from my reality. Soon, I began to relish English lessons, knowing every writing task was an opportunity for escapism.My love for the written word hit new heights when I started writing my own poetry. This developed into songwriting, which very quickly became my favourite way to express myself. Before long, I started performing songs in school assemblies, which gave me the confidence to perform at music events when I left school. Writing, in all its forms, was my passion and something I had a natural talent for – but I’m not sure I’d have ever discovered it were it not for Ms Sponge. She cultivated my skills and saw me for who I was an empty vessel waiting to be used to bless others.Despite her impact on me, I never dreamed of becoming a teacher myself. Even when I eventually found myself working in education after university, I was initially content with the impact I was making as a teaching assistant and a sports coach. However, the more I worked with disadvantaged children, the greater my desire to make the leap became. I wanted to change the narrative for young boys who came from similar backgrounds to mine, I wanted to be the role model I needed growing up – and I soon realised that becoming a fully fledged teacher was the best way to do this.Fortunately, I knew what a good teacher could do for a child’s confidence and development Ms Sponge’s kindness and love for teaching planted a seed in this young boy from East Ham. Despite the odds stacked against me as an excluded child, I went back to university to qualify as a teacher and now use my love of writing as a way to engage my students. I teach children who have social, emotional and mental health issues (SEMH) and most of them have had some type of adverse childhood experience.When I prepare my resources, I often incorporate my own stories, poems and song lyrics, and then get up in front of my year 6 pupils and perform as if I was headlining the Royal Albert Hall. It’s important for them to see me read so they, as young boys, learn to love the written word too. But I believe it’s also important for them to hear about my cultural experiences: what it was like growing up in a Nigerian household or being a teenager in east London.As a young, black man who never had a black male primary teacher, I appreciate that representation matters. Some students can relate to my experiences for others I provide a new perspective. Ultimately, sharing my authentic self is what makes me unique, and I encourage my students to do the same. I also urge them to read aloud to others, because their voice and experiences deserve to be heard.Children are ready and waiting to absorb knowledge, as long as you give them the chance to take the lead in their learning. This is why I love being a teacher, particularly to primary school children to play a part in shaping the lives of the next generation is a privilege, and something I never take for granted.As an educator in an SEMH school, you don’t hear many “thank yous” on a day-to-day basis, but the seed you sow in your students can’t be underestimated. And with the uncertainty and confusion brought on by the pandemic, there’s never been a more important time to remind teachers that they’re doing the most important job in the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fe271379a9b5ed1da54a872cf2dbabc78e3752c/0_288_4339_2604/master/4339.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f33abec3c206d67a2358a1b05a28a0","title":"riding high the surfing maths teacher on the crest of a wave","story":"When she’s not in the classroom, teacher Emily Grimes can be found riding waves in the chilly North Sea. She tells Nicole Morley how she came to find her perfect balanceIt might be a frosty afternoon in the depths of winter, but Emily Grimes is in her wetsuit, catching some post-work waves in the North Sea, just a short drive from Monkseaton high school, a comprehensive in Whitley Bay, where she teaches maths.The 26-year-old, who grew up in Blaydon, near Gateshead, a town featured in the 19th-century Geordie folk song Blaydon Races, has always loved the outdoors and grew up riding horses. But it wasn’t until a post-university trip to Australia in her early 20s that she caught the surfing bug.“I remember thinking: ‘I don’t get the point,’ after seeing people paddle out and then get pushed back towards the beach,” she laughs. “But once you start surfing, you begin to see nature and the weather in such a different way. It has definitely made me feel more connected to the natural world.”For Grimes, surfing is a mental exercise as much as a physical one – something she’s valued more than ever as she’s navigated her first year of teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic. “I feel so lucky that I’ve still been able to surf during lockdown. It’s provided a real stress release and escapism.“When you’re on a board on a wave you can’t think of anything else. It’s a flowing sort of state, which I hadn’t experienced before,” she says. “When you’re on a horse you aren’t totally immersed in what you are doing, not like when you’re in the water.”Grimes always excelled at maths, and for a time it seemed she was destined for a career in the City. But an office job was never something that really appealed, and after graduating with a 2:1 in economics and finance from Newcastle University, she spent two years travelling around the US and Australia, before returning to her native north-east to train as a teacher.While surfing might be a relatively new hobby, teaching is an option that Grimes has long had in mind. After university, she came to realise that it was a career she would find immensely rewarding – and one that would allow her to continue her outdoorsy lifestyle.“Even back in sixth form, I would learn by helping my friends and teaching them. I also tutored pupils taking economics A-level while I was studying it at university. When I was in Australia, as well as leading horseback tours I taught at a riding school and worked as a surf instructor.”For Grimes, teaching on the north-east coast has provided the perfect work-life balance, allowing her to not only pursue, but actually combine, her passions for teaching and surfing.“I think the skills of teaching surfing and teaching in school are totally transferable,” she says. “In both cases I’m sharing my skills and passions. Obviously teaching maths is a lot more formal, but whether I’m on the beach or in the classroom it’s about building collaborative relationships.”Fortunately for Grimes, she’s found a school with an outlook that matches her surfer’s spirit. “What I like about Monkseaton high is that its ethos is based on equality, positivity and mutual respect. You can feel that in a school. It’s welcoming.”That’s not to say that her students aren’t sometimes a little taken aback when they discover that their new maths teacher likes to ride waves in her spare time. On discovering Grimes’s hobby, a rather perplexed year 10 student remarked: “I didn’t even realise teachers had lives!”Grimes smiles: “I like it when pupils find out that I surf. They’ll see the surfboards on top of my car, and see me heading off after school when the surf is good, and ask about it, which I love. I want to make sure they see me as approachable and know there is mutual respect.”In fact, it’s exactly these kind of exchanges that have led Grimes to love her career in teaching. “It’s the relationships that you build with the pupils, and the interaction,” she says. “I get so much out of it when I see pupils progress. People may think that teaching or helping people is a selfless act, but it actually makes me feel so good. It’s a really unbeatable feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7ddbf99afd6a09399a964725fec163c74113e8d/950_560_1574_945/master/1574.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=373652eedcf8847a34abb9f13c533bcf","title":"education is freedom why my mothers legacy drives me to teach","story":"Inspired by her parents’ dreams – and her pupils’ joy – Rihula Sameer-Mour is fiercely committed to fostering a love of learning in the classroomFrom a young age my parents taught my siblings and me that education was freedom. I was born on Fuvahmulah, an island in the Males with few schools and around 40 in a class. Good grades were highly valued and my parents encouraged hard work. Education brought opportunities we weren’t born with it was the way to build a good life. My mother, Khaulath, was head of English at the school, and my father, Abdulla, who’s a well-known poet, taught Dhivehi, our local dialect, so teaching was in my DNA.When I was eight years old we moved to Australia where mum studied for her degree in education. I went to a school that was creative and enriching, with lots of outdoor learning. I was the only child who wasn’t white but, as a kid, I didn’t notice our differences. We moved to England when I was 13, this time for mum’s PhD. School, in inner-city Manchester, was a different environment again. My friends and I were studious and had to work hard to make it, but I got A*-B grades at GCSE and went on to A-levels and an English degree.I think teaching is in my DNA. As a child, I would make registers and pretend to teach at home. I knew it was a good job and saw the respect that my parents earned from people on the island who, long after they’d left school, would come up to them to say how they’d inspired them. I saw my parents’ dedication and how happy the job made them.My mother died in 2013, weeks after giving birth to my youngest sister. The day before she slipped into a coma, I was due in London for my teacher training interview. I wanted to stay at her bedside but mum told me to go. I missed her final, waking day. From then on, everything in my career has had to be worth it, it has to mean something. I help care for my younger siblings (I am one of five) and I guide them with their school work. My parents’ inspiration is everything to me.When I took my first teaching job in 2014 I wasn’t sure I was cut out for it, but the school I teach in now has changed my life. I joined four years ago and was given a mentor. He taught me how to be a creative and inspiring teacher, and gave me confidence. I made friends and now mentor trainee teachers myself. Teaching is not just about the children, it’s the mark you can make on colleagues and the community too.A year into the job I was promoted to head of English. I am now head of year and sit on the governing body too. I didn’t realise how rare it was for a woman of colour to hold a leadership position in a UK school and I’m proud to be part of the change. I would love other young people to continue taking up the mantle, to see that those roles are within their reach. Even if you are the only person who looks like you, going for jobs you deserve will enrich the ersity in classrooms.I have my father’s love of writing and instil that passion in the children I teach. I established a partnership with Manchester’s Portico library that gives our pupils the chance to have a book review or short story published each year. A couple of years ago, I travelled to South Africa to establish links with a school in Cape Town. Now the children write to one another and share details about their lives. Writing unlocks the world for young people it brings a subject or a place to life and allows them to express their own views and experiences.There is so much I love about teaching – the children, the joy they get as they progress. Playing a part in that is so rewarding, it gives me real purpose. This is a profession where hard work pays off. Our school is creative, we try to give the children ownership, chances to lead their learning, guiding them to discover answers for themselves.There are pupils going through hard times who allow me to connect with them too.

Also called ahi tuna, this species is massively overfished in the Indian Ocean – so much so that supermarkets and brands including Tesco, Co-op and Princes recently took the surprising step of joining scientists and environmental groups to call for tough action to rebuild the $4bn population.But although the Indian Ocean is bordered by Africa, Asia and Australia, the single biggest harvester of yellowfin in the area is the European Union. EU nations – principally Spain and France – operate a “distant water fleet” of 43 vessels that fish the seas thousands of miles from home. In 2019 they caught 70,000 tonnes of yellowfin, more than Indian Ocean coastal states such as Iran (58,000 tonnes), Sri Lanka and the Males (44,000 tonnes each).EU ships are major users of “fish-aggregating devices” (FADs). These fishing aids are floating objects that cast a shadow to attract groupings of fish. By casting nets near FADs, catches can be increased with less effort but can lead to more bycatch – including juvenile tuna that have not yet reproduced.Now a row has broken out between the EU and the tiny developing coastal states whose economies are directly dependent on the Indian Ocean. A former Seychelles fishery official has accused the EU of “hypocrisy and neocolonialism”, while the Males described the EU’s proposals to rebuild yellowfin populations as “woefully inadequate”.These issues come in the buildup to next week’s “crucial” emergency meeting of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), the regulatory body in charge of managing tuna stocks. Both the EU and the Males, out of 33 parties involved, have made proposals to the IOTC to reduce overfishing and rebuild populations.It is the much poorer Males, however, that has proposed the toughest reductions. The EU is calling for a much less dramatic cut. Neither include measures to reduce the use of FADs, which NGOs say drives population decline.“This is a ‘band-aid’ measure from the EU,” said Adam Ziyad, director general of the Males fisheries ministry and vice-chair of the IOTC. “It is nowhere near the required reduction levels to ensure we conserve the yellowfin stocks for our future generations. If they were serious, they would take a bigger hit and they would work with coastal states to have a better management plan.”“Neither should be regarded as end points,” the GTA said. It claimed that the Males proposal was not “proportionate or equitable” either, because it focused on purse seiners, a type of wide-net fishing that is not generally practised by Males pole-and-line fishers.Environmental organisations, meanwhile, called the Males proposal “the bare minimum” in a letter to the IOTC heads of delegation co-signed by groups including the World Wildlife Fund and Blue Marine Foundation. They noted, for example, that neither proposal addressed the use of FADs, which NGOs say worsens overfishing by disproportionately catching juvenile yellowfin.Nirmal Shah, former chair of Seychelles Fishing Authority and now the chief executive of Nature Seychelles, described the EU proposal as a “delaying tactic”.“The EU is hypocritical, going around the world talking about overfishing. It’s a neocolonial situation,” said Shah. “What the EU are telling us is they don’t care about our coastal nations.”Jess Rattle, of the Blue Marine Foundation, accused the EU of being the “biggest contributor” to yellowfin tuna overfishing because of its dominance and use of FADs.“Unsurprisingly, the EU has put forward a yellowfin proposal that is woefully insufficient, would not lead to the timely recovery of the stock and could in fact allow the EU fleet to increase its own catches, compared to 2019,” Rattle said.She welcomed the Males proposal, which urges catch reduction, as “in line with IOTC management advice”, adding that it “calls for a much greater catch reduction than the EU’s, takes into account the needs of developing coastal states, and shows truly fantastic leadership that we hope will be met with support from all IOTC members”.Greenpeace described the EU’s proposal as “outrageous and inequitable”, and said neither proposal was enough to rebuild the tuna population.In response to the criticism, an EU official said it strongly supported “an effective reduction of catches to rebuild stock” and had been “instrumental” in the IOTC’s decision to convene a special session. The official defended the EU proposal as “ambitious but realistic”, with an obligation to reduce catches for all fleets, regardless of size, in a fair and equitable way.With neither the EU nor the Males proposing to restrict FADs, it was Kenya and Sri Lanka that submitted a separate proposal to do so.“Kenya, the Males and like-minded coastal nations only fish in the Indian Ocean, so if the stocks get depleted we are the ones who suffer,” said Stephen Ndegwa, assistant director of fisheries at Kenya’s agriculture ministry. “We will have nothing for future generations.“The foreign fishing vessels, like the EU vessels, will move to other oceans, but we won’t be able to move – and we will be stuck with no fish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae31e4b781db9604535e2614964b793402fe2d9e/0_0_1275_714/master/1275.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9d133252b53bfe822ed294473022d19 720w","title":"genesis owusu smiling with no teeth","story":"Inspired by everyone from the Purple One to Kendrick Lamar, the maverick star’s bold new album confronts depression and racismGenesis Owusu’s freaky, funky marvel of a debut album bears the patina of a time-worn fable. Smiling With No Teeth – a 15-track collection of post-punk thrums synths that scream and sigh and sometimes crooned, sometimes snarled vocals – is its own world, with a distinct geography, iconography and ideology. And before its creator launches you into it, he handily offers a prologue in the form of new wave-y lead single The Other Black Dog: “A tale of Black dogs with golden leashes … Broken stories, told facetious … Who’s the pet and who’s the teacher?”Now 22, Owusu was born Kofi Owusu-Ansah in Ghana, then moved to Canberra, Australia when he was two. Canberra, like much of Australia, is extremely white, and although there are tight-knit non-white communities to be found everywhere, institutions like schools often remain ignorant of the experiences of people of colour. Owusu-Ansah’s brother, the rapper Citizen Kay, was five years his elder, meaning that the pair only went to school together for a year before Owusu-Ansah was on his own.And so Smiling With No Teeth drips intent, clear about its focal points – depression and racism – and how to represent them lyrically. The most important image is that of the two Black dogs, symbolising depression and racism, but also taken from a slur hurled at Owusu-Ansah as the only Black child in a blindingly white area.“I wanted to talk about these topics but I didn’t want to just be like: ‘Here are a whole bunch of statistics,’” Owusu-Ansah explains. Personifying depression and racism gave him a chance to evoke the very real tension and danger they present in the real world, and to explore the way the former heightens the latter – an acknowledged truth that feels rarely discussed. “Going through racial abuse as a kid wouldn’t do wonders for one’s mental health, and then being in white spaces after that might exacerbate the paranoia of that situation. Making them into characters made it a bit easier to elaborate on how they interact with each other, because I can frame it like a relationship between two people.”This repeated iconography provides a through line for what is a remarkably varied debut, touching upon anthemic 80s rock (on Kirin J Callinan-featuring highlight Drown), synth-funk, out-and-out punk (Black Dogs) and everything in between. Owusu-Ansah achieved this frenetic, hard-to-pin-down style by bucking a more traditional producers-and-beats A\u0026ampR method – which he had used in the past – and instead holing down with a band, made up of Callinan on guitar, house producer Touch Sensitive on bass, World Champion’s Julian Sudek on drums, and Andrew Klippel, founder of Owusu-Ansah’s label Ourness, on keys.“I’ve been working with producers my whole career until this point, and it wasn’t erratic enough for me, really. It wasn’t chaotic,” Owusu-Ansah says. “Like, me and one other person can think of some weird shit. Five people with their own instruments, who can do whatever they want, whenever they want, that was way more fun – way more experimentation, and I’m always about that, I’m always about the rollercoaster rides.” Owusu-Ansah probably could have made a simpler, less labour-intensive album and still coasted to a successful debut based purely on the plaudits he’s accrued since breaking out with 2017 single Sideways – he is a two-time nominee at the Arias (the Australian equivalent of the Grammys), has been supported by star-making radio station Triple J, and routinely astonishes crowds with a live show that includes rose petal-throwing hype men and a superhuman expenditure of energy – but he is far too ambitious for that.That truth is wilder and more thrilling than one could imagine. Inspired equally by Prince and Talking Heads – “But like if Prince were a rapper, in 2020, in Australia” – Smiling With No Teeth might freak some out, but feels more likely to win fans than lose them. Either way, Owusu-Ansah doesn’t really care: “I have no interest in being like some random pop star or rap star with a million random people who don’t really care about me as an artist,” he says. “I want to reach people who will really understand it.” Smiling With No Teeth is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd8684aa2d570878afbe52e2138bfe7275f6787a/244_286_4076_2446/master/4076.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=a70d185ba6b608698f85a72591968b39","title":"alex salmond nicola sturgeon and the turmoil inside scottish politics","story":"With Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon giving evidence today, the ’s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, charts the unravelling of the alliance between first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond – once seen as Scotland’s greatest political partnership’s Scotland correspondent, Libby Brooks, discusses the turmoil inside the SNP, with Rachel Humphreys. Today Nicola Sturgeon gives evidence to the Scottish parliament’s inquiry into the government’s handling of complaints of sexual assault against Alex Salmond. Sturgeon has been accused by the former first minister of possibly breaking the ministerial code and is subject to a second inquiry that will examine this.  Yesterday John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first minister, agreed to release his government’s legal advice on Salmond’s court action after facing cross-party censure in Holyrood. It reveals that the Scottish government was warned by its senior lawyers it faced defeat in an ultimately successful legal action by Alex Salmond. The guidance, released by Scottish ministers on Tuesday, confirms that their two counsel told them the revelation that a senior official had previously met and briefed two complainers against Salmond had devastating consequences for their case. There were further developments yesterday when evidence from two other witnesses called into question Ms Sturgeon’s version of events. Text messages between senior party and government officials, which Salmond last Friday claimed indicated that witnesses and the police were pressurised to pursue his criminal charges in order to overtake the judicial review, were handed over to the inquiry too. Libby looks at the impact this could have on the SNP and its fight for a second referendum on independence. It’s just a few months until Scotland heads to the polls.

A Vatican spokesperson said the trip was “an act of love to a country that has suffered terribly over recent decades”.The highlights of the three-day visit – the pope’s first trip abroad in 15 months due to the Covid pandemic – will be a meeting with Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a leading Shia cleric, and worship with Iraq’s diminished Christian population that suffered brutal treatment under Islamic State rule.Despite worries about the risks of his visit amid rising Covid rates in Iraq, a largely unmasked choir sang as Francis was greeted by the Iraqi prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi. Both men removed their face masks, shook hands and spoke sitting less than 2 metres apart.The 84-year-old pope, his entourage and 75 media representatives travelling with the Vatican delegation have been vaccinated against Covid, but most Iraqis have not.Hundreds of people had gathered along the airport road with hopes of catching a glimpse of the pope’s plane touching down. Billboards showing Francis with the slogan “We are all brothers” are on display in central Baghdad, and Iraqi and Vatican flags are lining streets.Security has been increased during the visit, said Tahsin al-Khafaji, the spokesperson for Iraq’s joint operations. “The whole world will be watching,” he said. The high stakes will give Iraqi forces “motivation to achieve this visit with safety and peace”, he added.Instead of his customary open-sided popemobile, Francis will travel in an armoured car, as well as making longer journeys between regions by plane and helicopter.The Vatican and Iraqi authorities have played down the threat of Covid and insisted that social distancing, crowd control and other healthcare measures will be enforced.At a meeting with Iraq’s president, Barham Salih, inside the heavily fortified Green Zone, Francis said Iraqis of all faiths deserved to have the same rights and protections as the Shia Muslim majority.He said: “Only if we learn to look beyond our differences and see each other as members of the same human family will we be able to begin an effective process of rebuilding and leave to future generations a better, more just and more humane world.”He added: “The age-old presence of Christians in this land, and their contributions to the life of the nation, constitute a rich heritage that they wish to continue to place at the service of all.”Francis called for an end to “acts of violence and extremism, factions and intolerance” and urged Iraqi officials to “combat the scourge of corruption, misuse of power and disregard for law”.Salih said it was “impossible to imagine the Middle East without Christians” and that their continued migration would have dire consequences.Later, the pope addressed the faithful at the Our Lady of Salvation church in Baghdad’s commercial Karrada district, where attendance was restricted to enable social distancing.In 2010 Islamist militants stormed the church and killed 44 worshippers, two priests and several security force personnel in one of the bloodiest attacks on Iraq’s Christians.Francis thanked his fellow clergy for remaining close to Iraq’s beleaguered Christians, who he said had paid “the ultimate price of their fidelity to the Lord and his church”.On Saturday he is due to fly to the city of Najaf to meet Sistani, and on Sunday he will travel north to meet Christian communities.The pope will honour the dead in a Mosul square surrounded by shells of destroyed churches and meet Christians who have returned to the town of Qaraqosh. He will bless their church, which was used as a firing range by Isis.Many Christians fled when Isis militants swept through towns across the Nineveh plains in 2014, destroying churches and homes.The few who have returned have struggled to find work, with many blaming discriminatory practices in the public sector, Iraq’s largest employer. Since 2003 public jobs have been mostly controlled by majority Shia political elites, leaving Christians feeling marginalised.There were an estimated 1.4 million Christians in Iraq before the US-led invasion in 2003, but now the number is believed to be about 250,000.Fuad Hussein, Iraq’s foreign minister, said Iraqis were eager to welcome Francis’s “message of peace and tolerance” and described the visit as a historic meeting between the “minaret and the bells”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b69bbf1cdd0c58ed344d857eaeb391e98405b2/87_121_7011_4687/master/7011.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=05bbef174ca4cbbdaaee66b5cd6d39b6\" height=\"4687\" width=\"7011\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"css-uk6cul","title":"coronavirus live news who wuhan mission uk investigating new covid variant","story":"Italy warns of rapid spread of new cases WHO chief warns of third and fourth surges if curbs eased too fastBelgian prime minister Alexander De Croo set out a roadmap for easing lockdown restrictions on Friday, even as Covid-19 infections rose, with restaurants, bars, gyms and cinemas set to reopen on 1 May.De Croo gave Belgians a glimpse of light at the end of a five-month period of restrictions that have only allowed schools, shops and, more recently, hairdressers to operate. “The situation remains very delicate. We must remain cautious and we must do everything to keep the situation under control,” De Croo told a news conference after a meeting of ministers, health experts and regional leaders.

From April 1, Belgians should be able to enjoy theme parks and amateur sport. Indoor activities will reopen on May 1. If cases spike in the coming weeks, the calendar could be revised. Social distancing and mask-wearing rules remain in place and testing and vaccinations should accelerate “The only real exit plan is the vaccination plan,” De Croo said. New hospital admissions rose to a daily average of 155 on Thursday, from 125 in recent weeks. De Croo said the figure was likely to rise further but was not a reason to panic.

The figures also showed the country added 6,797 confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 2,119,305.France reported 23,507 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, down from 25,205 a week ago, but the number of people in intensive care with the disease reached its highest level so far this year, health ministry data showed. The number of new cases compared to the same day a week earlier fell for a third day in a row, and the seven-day moving average of new cases fell by 243. However it remained above 21,000 for a tenth day, with a 6 p.m. curfew in place since mid-January so far failing to slow the infection rate. On January 16, when the curfew was tightened from 8 p.m., the seven-day average of new cases stood just above 18,000. The cumulative number of cases increased to 3.86 million. France has had to send ICU patients from overcrowded hospitals to other regions and the government has also imposed a weekend lockdown in three heavily hit coastal areas, including Calais and Nice. After the first lockdown in early 2020, the number of people in intensive care dropped from a high of more than 7,000 to less than 400 in August. It rose again to nearly 5,000 during a second lockdown in November, only dipping below 3,000 for a few weeks before rising again at the end of January. The French health ministry reported 439 new Covid-19 deaths on Friday - including retirement home death tallies for three days - taking the total to 88,274.

An R number above 1 indicates infections will grow at an exponential rate. Italy has established a four-tier colour-coded system (white, yellow, orange and red) with curbs calibrated according to the infection levels and revised every week, Reuters reports.Campania, centred on the southern city of Naples, will join Basilicata and Molise in the strictest red zone as of Monday. Movement will be severely limited, and bars, restaurants and schools closed along with most shops. Travellers who turn up at an airport without a form stating the reason for their trip face fines of £200, the UK government has announced.From Monday, anyone who is going abroad from England will need to complete and carry a declaration to travel document that can be obtained from the government’s website.Sarah Marsh, a  news reporter, has the full story here: More than 200,000 Russians diagnosed with Covid-19 have died since the pandemic began last April, Russia’s Rosstat statistics agency said on Friday, more than double the widely cited figure used by the government’s coronavirus task force.The figures from Rosstat suggest Russia has had the third most Covid-19 fatalities in the world, behind only the United States and Brazil.Rosstat, which releases its figures infrequently and with a time lag, said it had recorded 200,432 deaths through January. The government coronavirus task force’s tally, updated daily, had recorded 88,285 deaths as of Friday. France reported 23,507 new confirmed Covid cases on Friday, down from 25,279 the previous day and down from 26,788 on Wednesday.The French health ministry reported 439 new Covid deaths, from 293 on Thursday, taking the total to 88,274. The total number of cases now stands at 3,859,102.UK health secretary Matt Hancock has said that the mystery sixth case of the Brazilian P1 variant of coronavirus has been identified.Using the latest technology and with the dogged determination of our Testing and Tracing scheme, we have successfully identified the person in question. The best evidence is that this person stayed at home and there is no evidence of onward transmission but as a precaution, we are putting more testing in Croydon where they live to minimise the possibility of spread.The arrival of Covid vaccines should not tempt countries to relax efforts to fight the pandemic, top World Health Organization officials said on Friday, citing particular concern about the situation in Brazil.“We think we’re through this. We’re not,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, told an online briefing, according to Reuters. “Countries are going to lurch into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.” Record Covid deaths have been reported in Brazil this week and its hospital system is on the brink of collapse, driven partly by a more contagious variant first identified there.On a global level, Covid case numbers reversed a six-week downwards trend last week despite the delivery of millions of doses of vaccines in recent weeks, WHO data showed.“Now is not the time for Brazil or anywhere else for that matter to be relaxing,” Ryan added. “The arrival of vaccines is a moment of great hope but it is also potentially a moment where we lose concentration.” The below tweet is from the World Health Organization. Writing in the , its director, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said earlier that the world needs to be “on a war footing”. Before a key meeting of the World Trade Organization next week on the anniversary of the declaration of the pandemic, he supports a patent waiver that would allow countries to make and sell cheap copies of vaccines that were invented elsewhere. Europe’s medicines regulator has said an antibody drug combination developed by Eli Lilly and Co can be used to treat Covid patients who do not require oxygen support and are at high risk of progressing to severe illness, Reuters reports.The recommendation can now be used as guidance in inidual European nations on the possible use of the combination of bamlanivimab and etesevimab, before a marketing authorisation is issued, the European Medicines Agency said. The Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has triggered a wave of revulsion by telling citizens to stop “whining” about a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 260,000 people.The far-right populist made the inflammatory declaration on Thursday, as Brazil’s already dire Covid situation deteriorated and its average daily death toll rose above that of the United States.“Stop all this fussing and whining. How long are you going to keep on crying?” Bolsonaro asked supporters in the midwestern state of Goiás, where nearly 9,000 people have died.Read more here:Italy has reported 24,036 new Covid cases up from 22,865 the day before.It also reported 297 more deaths – down from 339 people who were reported to have died from the virus on Thursday.One of Barcelona’s top music venues will hold a concert for 5,000 people later this month after no Covid cases were reported at a pilot project using same-day testing, Reuters reports.No social distancing will be required at the show, headlined by Spanish indie band Love of Lesbian, and concert-goers will be able to buy drinks, said organiser Festivals for Safe Culture.To avoid a potential super-spreading event, attendees must present a negative antigen test taken the same day, and wear FFP2 masks. The arena will be ided in zones of fewer than 1,800 people.The gig, scheduled for 27 March in Barcelona’s Palau Sant Jordi, will serve as a pilot to establish “a new protocol for holding events in the current context,” the company said in a statement.Organisers decided to go ahead with the event after receiving positive results from a scientifically monitored concert of two DJ sets and two live performances last December."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"CDP says number of Irish companies reporting is up from 31 to 47Reductions due to coronavirus pandemic will prove temporary, concludes global stocktake"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been almost a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 200,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,000 people have died.Globally, over 100 million people have been diagnosed and over 2.5\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Scientists have been racing to develop a vaccine that would bring an end to the pandemic, and there are now 64 different vaccines in clinical development, with another 173 in preclinical development, according to the World Health Organisation.Three of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer and another from Moderna.The EU has put in place purchase agreements with four other vaccines once they are approved for use - Sanofi-GSK, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen) and Curevac. The bloc is also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva. 144,581 had received their second dose.Some 161,532 of these vaccines had gone to people in long term residential care facilities, while 235,590 had gone to frontline healthcare workers and 63,029 had gone to people over the age of 70.Globally, over 276 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been administered.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 5.4 million doses by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.Two doses of the vaccine, four weeks apart, are needed to offer the best protection against Covid. However, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc. While talks continue on how to increase production, the company has now committed to a total of 40 million doses for the EU in the first quarter of 2021.While the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab, resulting in a significant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.How many will Ireland get? 190,000 doses in February and a further 95,000 in early March - supply after this is not confirmed.Storage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Expected on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more, assuming it secures regulatory approval.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, paving the way for its availability in Ireland by April.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million dosesStorage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and expects to have its first results by April 2021. On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?In December the HSE published the provisional order in which people in Ireland will be vaccinated against Covid-19. After over-65s in care homes and frontline health workers, people aged 70 and older and other healthcare workers are next in line to receive the vaccine.The next categories are: people aged 65-69 years an ill-defined group referred to as “key workers” and people aged 18-64 with certain medical conditions. Next up will be: those living or working in crowded conditions people working in education those aged 55-64 workers in other occupations important to the functioning of society people aged between 18 and 54 and, finally, pregnant women and those under 18.As of March 2nd, 235,590 vaccines had gone to\u0026nbspfrontline healthcare workers, while 161,532 vaccines had gone to people in longterm residential healthcare facilities.The vaccination of people aged over 85 began on Monday, February 15th, with 63,029 shots\u0026nbspbeing administered so far, while those in the 70-84 age bracket should begin to receive their first dose by March 8th.The HSE has said everyone over the age of 70 should have received their second dose by mid-May.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4502290.1614955994!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the first eight days how the coronavirus pandemic struck ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIschgl is a swish and popular ski resort in southern Austria – and a perfect petri dish for the spread of the new coronavirus. Photograph: Getty ImagesFebruary 29th, 2020The first confirmed case of coronavirus in Ireland. The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) confirms it is a “male in the eastern party of the country” who has returned from an affected area in northern Italy. Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said: “This is not unexpected. We have been preparing for this eventuality for many weeks now.”The last day of February 2020 in Ischgl was a day from heaven. The conditions were calm, windless. Against an azure blue sky, snowy white peaks dazzled like diamonds. Thousands of people arrived into the Pauznan Valley that day and made their way up to the skiing resort nestled at an altitude of 1,377 metres in the Austrian Alps.There may have been no avalanches or lenticular clouds but the tourists in their brightly-coloured jackets and ski goggles were walking into the eye of a deadly hurricane, one that would sweep its way across Europe within weeks. This storm might not have been visible but had already been raging here for days, if not weeks.In time, this small Austrian resort would become identified as the first super-spreader of Covid-19 in Europe, reckoned to have seeded many hundreds of cases in at least ten countries. And among those were dozens of early Irish cases.Ischgl is a swish and popular ski resort in the Tyrol region of southern Austria with 293km of ski runs, and 45 ski lifts, offering the highest quality skiing in the region. The local cable car company netted €80 million in 2019, making it the biggest operator in Austria.The resort has been popular with the Germans, Danes, Norwegians, Finns, British, Icelandic and Irish. It has not only been a magnet for its superlative ski runs. Its reputation as a lively apres-ski and party resort has also earned it the nickname ‘Ibiza on Ice’. No matter how clean the Alpine air might be, a crowded skiing resort with a crowded nightlife scene was a perfect petri dish for the spread of the new coronavirus.February 29th was a Saturday. That was the turnover day for the weekly packages, when one wave of tourists left and another arrived. Among the incoming skiers were dozens of Irish people, mostly arriving on Ryanair flights landing in the German airport of Memmingen.The first case of coronavirus had been notified in Ireland that day. But for those arriving from Dublin, Ischgl seemed a big remove from the hotspot of northern Italy.Eóin Wright from Kilmainham, Dublin was among a group of six from Ireland, all in their fifties, who arrived that day. On the same flight was another group of five friends, all from Munster, also in their fifties. They included Tipperary men Brendan Bourke and John Cormack, a former All-Ireland winning country hurler.March 1st, 2020The secondary school where the teenager was a pupil is closed down, with all parents and teachers being told to restrict their movements for 14 days.Case number one in Ireland was a second-level student from northern Dublin. The family had gone on a skiing holiday in Italy during the mid-term break earlier in February. At that stage the virus was associated with a handful of villages in northern Italy and not with the Alps. The family flew home through Bergamo Airport and spent a few hours there. It is likely it was there the infection occurred.At the time, the focus was on 11 small villages in that region and not the city. It was only later Bergamo became the epicentre of the virus in Italy with distressing images of overcrowded ICU units and coffins lined up outside morgues.When the family returned home, the number of cases in most European countries outside Italy could have been counted on the fingers of one hand. The official HSE advice then applied only to those who arrived from a high-risk region (China, Far East, Iran, and northern Italy), or were a close contact of a confirmed case. They were told to self-isolate and contact their GP only if they were experiencing symptoms. That advice would not change until the middle of March.The family read the HSE website on its return. Then one of the teenager’s siblings started developing symptoms, including fever. He was tested but was negative for Covid. In fact, he had caught the flu. Despite not displaying symptoms, the father insisted all be tested. It was then the other teenager was confirmed as a positive case.The authorities might have been preparing carefully for this moment for many weeks, but, given all the build-up and anticipation, it was not a surprise the first case became such an enormous media event. Looked at a year later and through the prism of so many cases and deaths since then, the decision to shut down the teenager’s school now seems excessive.But so did the coverage, which bordered on the hysterical, especially on social media where those unfortunate enough to contract the disease in the first weeks of March were subjected to a witch hunt on Twitter and Facebook. This is despite the fact they had followed all of the advice (which was to contact your GP only if you were displaying symptoms) and were blameless.As it happened, the teenager remained asymptomatic throughout his 14-day quarantine – which in itself was telling.March 2nd, 2020Ireland remains in a containment phase, with one confirmed case currently in isolation and contact tracing is underway.Eóin Wright is a strong skier. The 53-year old father of three had been going to Ischgl for 15 years because of its superb and technical ski runs.“It’s more for advanced skiers. There was a group of six of us, from 53 to 57, all good skiers. Before we left Covid was not really an issue in Ireland. It was in Italy of course, but not in Austria we thought.”Ischgl has a reputation as a party resort. But for Wright and his friends, it was all about skiing. “We were not big apres-ski people. We had a few nights out but for us we had gone there to ski.”Brendan Bourke and his friends were also experienced skiers, enjoying the slopes during the day and the social life in restaurants and bars later on.Today, Bourke recalls the bars so crowded that staff had to blow whistles to get through the throngs.In an interview with the German media organisation Der Spiegel, his friend John Cormack talked about visiting Nikis Stadl bar, which was the source of a large cluster where the crowd sang along to German pop songs. The atmosphere does not vary from year to year. Nor do the songs – he knew the words of some of the German songs from previous visits. “You know what you are going to get,” he said.March 3rd, 2020A second case of coronavirus has been confirmed in the east of Ireland. The case is a female and is associated with travel from Italy. All non-essential travel to four regions in Italy is now being advised against. The previous advice was limited to 11 specific towns in the region.Some believe, even argue, the coronavirus was in Ireland much earlier than late February. However, Dr Cillian de Gascún, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory says: “The first laboratory confirmed case was on February 29. We started testing on February 7. We had been testing for the guts of a month and had not detected anything,” he says.One unusual case emerged in Cork. An elderly man in hospital since February died in March. He was subsequently found to have been positive for Covid-19. That gave rise to a suspicion the virus might have been in the country at an earlier stage. Subsequently, it emerged the man visited a restaurant in Cork also visited by a person recently returned from Italy. Transmission happened there, it is believed.If that was so, it might merely have pushed the date back a few days, rather than weeks and months. The weight of evidence shows the first cases in Ireland were associated with skiers returning from the Alps in Italy, France and Austria. But because many displayed no symptoms upon returning to Ireland, they might not have been tested as early as they could have been.This was a new virus. And it behaved very differently from previous iterations. In the initial states, asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission did not feature in the descriptions. The focus was on droplets and hand-washing, not aerosols. Face masks were not seen as necessary. There was no reference to a tell-tale sign, the loss of taste and smell.The knowledge of its characteristics reminded you a little of JK Galbraith’s famous quote on the 1929 Wall Street Crash: “They did not know that they did not know.”Connolly uses a colourful metaphor to put it in context. “The whole purpose of a virus is to perpetuate. If it kills you in the first five days, it is a boy racer virus and kills itself out.”She contrasts Covid-19 (Sars-CoV-2) with the earlier Sars virus, which caused 8,000 cases and killed 800 people between 2002 and 2004. It was successfully contained.Connolly explains: “With Sars 1 people began to show symptoms after day five, and they did not become infectious until after that. That gave you a window of time where you could isolate and quarantine.“But with this one it begins transmitting before people get sick, which is like the flu. A key ability of this virus is to transmit presymptomatically and asymptomatically.”De Gascún agrees: We were learning from our experience of the original Sars in 2002 and 2003 where viral loading increased over time with the duration of illness and people were only infectious with the onset of symptoms.“If we had known that earlier that would have had an impact on how we tackled things. Certainly, for example, the guidance around mask wearing changed when we realised that presymptomatic infection was a factor and people could have a high viral load before the onset of symptoms.”Laboratory testing confirmed the provenance of the early cases were from Europe.March 4th, 2020Four new cases are confirmed in Ireland. The patients have all returned from skiing holidays in northern Italy.As the Irish groups continue their skiing holidays, a development in Iceland changes everything for Ischgl. Groups of Icelandics who had been in the Austrian resort arrived back. Eventually 21 of them would test positive for Covid-19, and the country’s chief epidemiologist Dr Torolfur Gudnason declared Ischgl a “high risk area”.The Icelandic authorities contact their counterparts in the region. However, one of the Icelandic skiers refers to the possibility of being infected by a passenger he sat near on the flight returning from Italy. The Austrian authorities seize on that line to talk down the possibility of Ischgl being a hotspot. Local business interests do not want to shorten the season.Later that week, a Norwegian barman at a Ischgl restaurant tests positive. Fifteen colleagues subsequently do so, too. The restaurant was visited by both Irish groups who feature in this article.Soon new clusters emerged in Sweden, Germany, Denmark and Norway. All are traced back to Ischgl. Norway estimated 500 cases could be linked directly or indirectly to the resort.The Irish skiers – like all the holiday makers there – remain largely oblivious to the danger. Cormack told Der Spiegel his wife sent him a Whatsapp message on the 4th saying Iceland considered it a hotspot. They turn on the TV, but there is no reference to Ischgl on any channel.March 5th, 2020Seven new cases are confirmed. Four are linked to travel from northern Italy. There are now 13 confirmed cases in the State.Dr Roger McMorrow is an anaesthetist and clinical director of the National Maternity Hospital. He is admired for his ability to organise. The new coronavirus had been playing on his mind since he saw the first images from Wuhan in December. He organised a few meetings in work and on February 12th sent a general email to all staff on preparation.Like most hospitals, Holles Street did not have an plan in place that could cope with the storm that was coming. For one, there were critical shortages of PPE. “We had 100 SSP2 (surgical masks). That would not last one day dealing with a coronavirus patient,” he said.The hospital had one negative pressure ventilation room (where exhausted air is driven out). The emergency department, single rooms, a ward and a theatre complex were converted to negative pressure rooms. “Babies will keep coming. So we needed a normal obstetrics service. We cancelled gynaecology and used the rooms as a coronavirus ward.”It was done on a wing and a prayer. With PPE shortages, medical staff tried to wash and autoclave (sterilise) visors and gowns. Staff were limited to wearing face masks in certain areas.McMorrow put out an appeal on Twitter in the early days, and a company in Magherafelt that made blinds, developed a visor that the hospital could use. It arrived well before the first big deliveries from China.The hospital ultimately dealt (successfully) with three very sick patients, all of whom came though, with one baby being delivered early.A tenth, or slightly more, of the hospital’s staff were infected with the virus. As close contacts had to isolate, there were times when a fifth of all staff were absent. “That was a real burden”, he says.“Paradoxically, professionally, it was an extraordinary time to be a doctor. Everything you prepared for in your life led up to this point. It was a massive challenge, but all the normal barriers were removed. I had thought the HSE was not dynamic, but it stuck by everybody and put the shoulder to the wheel.”It was the first time in his career that Cillian de Gascún had seen a new virus emerge and watch it grow. “I was in training for Sars 1 and it never really came here. It has been interesting to watch the virus emerge and evolve and develop.”The virus has become more efficient. “It did take this virus some time to find its feet in humans. It was not readily transmissible. We have seen over the intervening 12 months it has attained a reproductive number of between 4 and 6 whereas seasonal influenza is down at 1.4“That is what has struck me. This virus has identified a new host, crossed the species barrier, managed to transmit and really travelled around the world in a short period of time,” he said.“To my mind there is no reason to believe it will not become an endemic virus. It is unlikely with vaccination we will be able to eliminate it. We have only really managed that with smallpox and one of the polio virus types.“It is not something that happens readily and with an R number of between four and six, it will be difficult to do especially when you have an asymptomatic transmission stage.”March 6th 2020Five new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland. Three are associated with travel. Involved in pandemic planning in recent years, Connolly says everyone was taken aback by the level of disruption, and its impact.New pandemics are possible. A century has passed since the Spanish flu, but there should be no complacency that it will take a century for the next one to arrive. “The one positive thing is there has been immense advances in vaccine technology and diagnostics and that will stand to us in the next pandemic,” she says.March 7th 2020One new case is confirmed – a man who returned from northern Italy. There are now 19 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Ireland.Eóin Wright and his five friends arrive home from Ischgl. All are feeling fine. “We heard about the Covid cases in Ireland and checked the HSE website just to be safe. Ischgl was not on the watchlist. There was nothing to be worried about.” Wright returned to work in the hairdressing salon he owns in Dublin. He was feeling 100 per cent.Then on Monday night the group got a call from their host in Ischgl to tell them that 12 staff in the restaurant they visited had tested positive.Wright looked at the website and saw that only those who were symptomatic should self-isolate. He rang a GP friend, Dave Coffey, who gave sage advice it might be best to take a week off work just as a precaution. It was just as well. On Thursday, one of the six tested positive. Wright sought a test on Friday. By Saturday he was beginning to feel ill.“All six of us got Covid,” he says. “Two got sick. Two were asymptomatic. One got headaches. One lost his sense of taste and smell. I was one of the two who got sick. I went downhill quickly with a high temperature, headaches, aches and lethargy. I was sick for 12 days.“There were 12 people in the salon and 20 clients that had to be tested. Everybody was negative which was a relief, as were my parents who are elderly.”A year later, Wright is still overcoming long Covid symptoms. He has had back problems and his sense of taste and smell have only come back in the last six weeks.He does not particularly blame Ischgl. “I don’t know if anybody at the time knew how bad it was or how dangerous it would be,” he said.Out of Brendan Bourke and John Cormack’s group, five got Covid. Bourke began to show symptoms after three days home. Like Wright, recovery has been show, with taste and smell back only in recent weeks.“I looked at the website for Ischgl a week after coming back. It showed people still on the slopes. I could not believe it. We were there when they got the warnings, and they tried to blame it on some guy coming from a plane going to Italy,” he says.He worried about who he had been in contact with when he was presymptomatic. Thankfully, he deliberately stayed away from his 91-year old mother. She celebrated her 92nd birthday at the end of February.But it was uncanny. Of the 11 people in the two groups, all tested positive.Cillian de Gascún says travel plays a key role and highlights the need for controlling importations. But he also points out that focusing exclusively on travel is too simplistic. Skiing trips did seed Ireland’s first cases, but the virus would have come in another way, even though the tempest would have been a little later coming.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics is affordable housing achievable","story":"In January, the Affordable Housing Bill was published by Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Darragh O’Brien.

This completely destroys the pledge of one-country, two-systems.Mr Patten went on to say the CCP was a continuing and brutal danger to all who believe in free and open societies.”China announced the new plans at the annual meeting of its ‘rubber-stamp’ parliament. The Communist Party said it wanted to “to safeguard national security, amid mounting criticism from the UK and other Western nations for Beijing’s suppression of the territory. “We will resolutely guard against and deter external forces’ interference in the affairs of Hong Kong,” Li Keqiang, the country’s premier, said in an opening speech to the National People\u0027s Congress in Beijing.About 3,000 delegates from across the country descended in Beijing, under increased security and coronavirus controls to ensure the most high-profile political event of the year goes off without a hitch.The annual two-week meeting is heavy on political spectacle and light on actual lawmaking, as delegates have no choice but to approve proposals put forward by the ruling Chinese Communist Party.This year, China’s parliament is expected to put forward a decision to “improve” Hong Kong’s electoral system that would allow Beijing to ensure only “patriots” can be elected to govern the territory. Opposition politicians have been deemed sufficiently “unpatriotic” to hold office. A largely pro-Beijing committee that elects Hong Kong\u0027s leader will also choose a large part of the legislature, a top Chinese official announced on Friday.He did not say how many legislators would be chosen by the committee. Hong Kong\u0027s South China Morning Post newspaper, citing unidentified sources, said it would be 30 seats in an expanded 90-seat legislature.Elections for Hong Kong’s mini-parliament could be delayed for a second year until September 2022 to allow for these changes, Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post reported on Friday.They were already delayed last year, with officials citing the coronavirus pandemic. Critics, however, accused the government of using public health reasons to stifle opposition candidates from running and potentially winning more seats.Allowing only candidates deemed “patriotic” would be devastating for Hong Kong by removing the last threads of political opposition in the city.Installing new election rules to do so will give Beijing a way to claim that barring some candidates is merely process, and required by law.  At the gathering last year, China announced a sweeping national security law for the territory, which criminalises anything deemed by Chinese authorities to be a national security crime.On Friday, Mr Li also announced that China would aim to hit above six per cent economic growth for 2021, moving the world’s second-largest economy back on its pre-pandemic growth trajectory. Despite coronavirus, China still managed to post 2.3 per cent growth last year.Beijing also plans to increase defence spending by 6.8 per cent this year, earmarking nearly 1.36 trillion yuan (£150 billion) on military, as leaders have grown increasingly shrill about shoring up “national sovereignty” – namely bringing Taiwan and Hong Kong under control.Mr Li also vowed that China would “remain highly vigilant against and resolutely deter any separatist activity seeking ‘Taiwan independence.’”China’s ceremonial legislature typically focuses on the domestic agenda, though its annual meeting has become increasingly overshadowed by geopolitics as leader Xi Jinping faces growing criticism for his crackdown on dissent, human rights abuses, and coercive trade practices.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccine side effects three times common have had virus","story":"Vaccine side-effects are seen up to three times more often in people who have previously been infected with coronavirus, new figures show.The latest data from the King\u0027s College ZOE app, which has logged details from more than 700,000 vaccinations, found those with a prior infection were far more likely to report side-effects than people who have not had the virus. The difference between the two was particularly pronounced among those who had been given the Pfizer jab.More severe side-effects are often a sign of better immunity, and emerging research suggests just one dose of vaccine gives a similar protective effect to two doses in people who have had a previous infection.Experts have now started to question whether people with prior immunity from a natural infection need a second dose at all.The ZOE data shows that 12.2 per cent of people reported side-effects after their first Pfizer jab, but that jumped to 35.7 per cent of those with a previous infection. For the OxfordAstraZeneca jab, 31.9 per cent of people reported symptoms following their first vaccine, rising to 52.7 per cent of those who had previously been diagnosed with diagnosed with the virus. Most people reported muscle aches, feeling groggy or headaches.Ellie Barnes, professor of hepatology and immunology at the University of Oxford and one of the Oxford vaccine team, said: There\u0027s emerging data to show that when you\u0027ve had a Covid infection your T-cells become activated, and then over the weeks after that they become memory T-cells and kind of calm down.But they are then able to respond very rapidly to subsequent vaccination. So if you\u0027ve been infected before and then get your first dose of the vaccine, you have a really excellent response to that single dose compared to someone that wasn\u0027t infected before.Last month, researchers from Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York, found that people with prior infection had between 10 and 20 times more antibodies after their first vaccination than those who had never had the virus. The authors said those with a previous infection would be unlikely to need a second dose and jab supplies could be erted elsewhere.The University of Maryland, in the US, also found a greater antibody response in healthcare workers who had previously been infected after vaccination.Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh, said: Both papers suggest that people who have had a PCR confirmed covid-19 infection may only require one dose of the vaccine. Certainly, this would appear to provide them with protection that is at least as good as two doses of vaccine. However, incorporating this into a mass vaccination programme may be logistically complex and it may be safer, overall, to ensure that everyone gets two doses.Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology, at the University of Warwick, said: If future work can confirm this high level of immunity post a single mRNA vaccine in this group of iniduals, this could become a viable option when there are concerns around vaccine supply.The King\u0027s research showed that women were twice as likely as men to suffer side-effects from the Pfizer jab and around 50 per cent more likely from the AstraZeneca vaccine.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"global britains divergence vindictive eu has left remainers","story":"The nature of political debate tends towards extending them way past the point at which they stopped being remotely relevant.To take a contemporary example, how often have you read a report of the latest opinion poll showing what proportion of Britons still support or oppose Brexit? It’s the equivalent of commissioning a poll to find out whether a majority of us support Edward VIII’s decision to abdicate. I mean, it’s interesting, I suppose, in a way, but isn’t it better to poll people on something that might actually happen in the future rather than the past?Like cold war warriors still arguing over the rights and wrongs of the Berlin Wall, die-hard Remainers and Brexiters seem locked in an eternal battle over export duties, free trade and immigration. It’s almost as if both sides have a preference for fighting yesterday’s battles over addressing the realities of today.It just so happens that a major new development in EU politics is actually relevant to those arguments of the recent past and presents a difficult, perhaps insurmountable, challenge to those who insist that we were wrong to respect the 2016 referendum result and deliver Brexit.Italy, with the blessing of the European Commission, has banned the export of 250,000 AstraZeneca Covid jabs to Australia. There must be a justification for this, the instinctive Remainer will tell themselves there must be more to it than a simplistic headline.Indeed there is, and none of it puts either Italy or the Commission in a particularly flattering light. Indeed the more you read about this absurd decision, the dimmer becomes one’s opinion of some of Europe’s most influential leaders. Angela Merkel, the fading star of German politics, revealed her grip on power was slipping – and deservedly so – when she made some ill-considered and ill-informed comments about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, suggesting she was too old for it to be effective. The German authorities, until yesterday, had refused to approve it for use in the over-65s. As a direct consequence, Germany – already lagging disastrously behind Britain’s roll-out of the vaccine to its citizens – was reported to have stockpiled 1.4 million doses of unused AstraZeneca vaccine.In France, vaccine nationalism was further boosted by President Emmanuel Macron’s equally dim statement that the AstraZeneca vaccine is “quasi-ineffective” against Covid. It’s hardly surprising, then, that take-up of this particular product across the EU has been lower than expected citizens, for whatever reason, take these comments seriously.A system that most believed was set up to monitor exports of the various vaccines from the EU to third countries has now been interpreted by the Italian government as a means of actually banning exports, a position that the Commission has so far not contradicted. Perhaps the Italians made the Commission an offer they couldn’t refuse.This follows another major misstep by the Commission when, having panicked earlier this year about the possibility that the UK might be profiting by its decision to go its own way in vaccine procurement rather than take part in the EU’s own system, actually issued an order to close the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, a decision that sparked fury across the world and forced an embarrassed Commission to back down within minutes.The EU single market which Remainers so desperately wanted to stay in has become a lever by which the free trade has been restricted, not enhanced.Meanwhile, in xenophobic, intolerant Brexit Britain, the Government has insisted that the Oxford-AstaZeneca vaccine is distributed worldwide at cost – in other words, without profit – to developing countries.Also in the “meanwhile” column, Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, has announced the removal of US tariffs on exports of Scotch whisky and reports are emerging that Britain may offer unprecedented numbers of work permits to Indian workers in return for a comprehensive free trade deal of the sort the EU have been trying – and failing – to negotiate for more than a decade.All of this – Merkel and Macron’s vaccine nationalism, the absurd decision to ban vaccine exports, the Commission’s threat to impose a hard border in Ireland after warning (falsely) for years that Brexiteers would do exactly that, Britain forging ahead with breaking down trade barriers with some of the world’s biggest markets – leaves an overall impression that far from becoming “Little Britain”, indulging in dreams of empire and withdrawing from the international community, we are heading in precisely the opposite direction. Crucially, at least in the last few torrid weeks, we are also heading in the opposite direction of the EU, which seems more concerned about borders and less supportive of free trade than at any time in its history.One amusing thought to leave you with: had an anti-Brexit coalition been formed after the 2019 general election (as was the last ditch hope of Remainers) with Jeremy Corbyn at its head (which is the outcome every Labour MP campaigned for), then the much-longed for second referendum on Brexit would have been scheduled for some time in 2020. That, of course, would have been postponed because of Covid and would have taken place either this year or next year.True, a UK governed by a coalition of Everyone-But-The-Tories would have agreed to be part of the EU vaccine authorisation programme so even though, consequently, far fewer of our citizens would by now have received their first dose of vaccine (with the resulting loss of life and increased hospitalisations), we could not know that another route would have been possible.Still, a referendum following the pandemic, in which the Commission’s misjudgment, its leaders’ ignorance and its members’ contempt for other countries would provide a very informative context for the referendum that (thankfully, for both sides) never happened.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz rishi sunak has announced furlough","story":"In the week that Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled his spring Budget, the \u0027s weekly news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to this week\u0027s headlines. Some measures included in the spring Budget may not be popular, but they are fair, according to the Chancellor.

I don’t consider Meghan Markle the most inspirational force to have ever stalked this green Earth, nor do I think she deserves the vitriol levelled at her. Indeed, I suspect that if more people sat on the fence like me, this Meghan debacle wouldn’t be such a vicious circle.Everyday I hear endless, vicious tirades from people about Meghan and her quotidian habits - many which on other people would be deemed inoffensive. Yet the disproportionality of these diatribes are precisely what compels people to defend Meghan and vault direct to the highest exaltations about what a wonderful person she is, eyes glazing over the more problematic allegations of bullying levelled against her - why add fuel to a fire already raging? The greater the censuring, the higher she can be hoisted on the cross by both herself and others - which in turn provokes greater pillorying over her Christ-like self-depiction.For young people, Meghan reflects the sole modernising force on the “Establishment”, the embodiment of various equalities and all the things we hold most dear - which is why we’re loathe to acknowledge she might not be the best representative for us. I personally believe unconscious racism drives a non-insignificant amount of anti-Meghan hatred. But I also feel uncomfortable that once the word “racism” is invoked, we must shut down the conversation, unable to debate clumsy missteps by her and Harry - like speaking out about their palatial woes while touring Africa.Ultimately, Meghan is a microcosm of a wider generational ide: You’re either an evil, stuffy old Tory or a virtue-signalling woke millennial - the Meghan debate represents everything you hate in the other side. My generation are thought of as prone to shouting big, activist words and wanting to have everything their way - hence the distaste for Meghan and Harry using the royal titles they supposedly reproach to clinch multi-million dollar Netflix deals  - for “impactful content that unlocks action” (what about action itself?).Yet my generation in turn consider the boomer desire for royals who only cut ribbons and “keep their heads down” somewhat Victorian. We think words spur action, are indicative of something deeper - which is why Meghan talking about mental health means something - in the way Diana hugging a child with Aids once did.As with many things today, it is considered logically impossible to believe both that Meghan was treated poorly by the Royal Family and that she might have treated others poorly. Yet the irony is the two are linked - we all know that the bullied are prone to bully. And the more vicious the attacks on Meghan, as with anyone who is human, the more base, emotive instincts will be triggered, the louder she will defend herself - and perhaps the less thoughtful she can be about how she does so.We’ve got ourselves into a place where the Meghan saga won’t end - that is, until one side oversteps the mark so heinously that no-one can stick by them anymore.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working office full time popular home working ons survey reveals","story":"The number of employees returning to work full time has increased since Boris Johnson\u0027s lockdown exit roadmap was announced, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data reveals.A total of 39 per cent of Britons now report working exclusively in the office, compared with 32 per cent who are only home working, the body\u0027s survey of more than 4,000 adults found.The proportion of exclusive home workers fell below that of exclusive office workers in the middle of June as the first lockdown measures were eased. Some 33 per cent of Britons reporting only working at home compared with 36 per cent working exclusively in the office.The gap continued to widen and office working dominated until the third national lockdown was announced in January, prompting home working to become more popular.However, this trend has now reversed, with 39 per cent of adults in Britain reporting going to the office full time between February 24 and 28, compared with 32 per cent who worked at home in the same period.The findings come a week after David Solomon, the boss of Goldman Sachs, rejected home working as an aberration which should be corrected as soon as possible.“I do think for a business like ours, which is an innovative, collaborative apprenticeship culture, this is not ideal for us - and it’s not a new normal, he said.But many businesses have embraced home working.HSBC, one of the country’s biggest employers, is planning to axe 40 per cent of global office space, equivalent to 112 football pitches.Lloyds, Britain’s biggest high-street bank, is poised to cut 20 per cent of its offices by 2023 after it found that three quarters of staff would like to work from home three or more days a week.The ONS\u0027s report also found that despite fluctuations in the dominance of exclusive home and office working, the proportion of people combining the two has remained relatively stable - suggesting many Britons have settled into a consistent pattern of varying their work environment.Their most recent figures show around 10 per cent of adults are combining home and office working. The peak of this trend was at the end of September, when 14 per cent reported doing so.The ONS previously found that 16 per cent of companies intend to use more home working as a permanent part of their business model. This was led by the IT and communications industry in which more than a third said remote working was here to stay.Meanwhile, the Prime Minister has rejected the idea that lockdowns during the pandemic will lead to a permanent shift to home working.Speaking at a rail industry conference via video call last week, Boris Johnson said: “I know that some people may imagine that all conferences are going be like this, held over Zoom, Teams or what have you and we’ve got to prepare for a new age in which people don’t move around, do things remotely, they don’t commute any more.“I don’t believe it. Not for a moment. In a few short months, if all goes to plan, we in the UK are going to be reopening our economy. And then, believe me, the British people will be consumed once again with their desire for the genuine face-to-face meeting that makes all the difference to the deal or whatever it is.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bishop calls fish chip tsar","story":"NewsBishop calls for fish and chip tsar to boost British fish sales after BrexitThe Rt Rev Alan Smith raised the suggestion in the Lords on Thursday in a bid to support fishermen who have seen their livelihoods wrecked by Tory Brexit chaosmirrorShareCommentsByOliver MilnePolitical Correspondent:,  MAR NewsPeople shouldnt be afraid to try something dferent when they head to the chippy \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Rt Rev Alan Smith raised the suggestion in the Lords on Thursday in a bid to support fishermen who have seen their livelihoods wrecked by Tory Brexit chaos.But the push to encourage more families to eat the deep-fried treat is unlikely to find favour in Downing Street, with the PM a fervent convert to healthy eating after being hospitalised with Covid last year. Bishop Smith said that the border issues that have seen rotting fish piling up on docks were an immediate, pressing problem for many of our fishermen, who are suffering. He called for a more flexible approach with the EU - allowing more British fish to find a market - but he also called for more people at home to put fish on their dinner plate.Bishop Smith asked: Whataposs the Government doing to increase fish consumption in the domestic market Do we need fish and chips tsar to encourage people to eat fish Environment Minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble replied that the Government was working robustly with the EU to help support British fish exports He added that the Department of Food and Rural Affairs were working on a Love Seafood campaign precisely to encourage the domestic consumption of excellent fish that hitherto we may not have consumed. Tsar or no Tsar, the chippie is still the go-to takeaway treat for most British families, with , fish and chip shops in the UK, serving  million meals a year. Polling by YouGov shows that fish and chips is already the second most popular British meal in the UK, after chips alone.

Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said changes to the school calendar were being looked at by the Governmentaposs catch-up tsar Sir Kevan Collins - and signalled that a long-term restructure of the school year was being considered. Sir Kevan has been asked to draw up plans to ensure the le chances of millions of children arenapost blighted by the huge disruption to their education during the pandemic. Askedthe six-week summer break was too long, Mr Williamson told the i newspaper: “I think we should never be nervous about looking at new routes and dferent ways of doing things.” He went on: “There’s been discussion about five-term years. It’s right to have that discussion, look at the evidence and make an assessment as to what are the best options, about how we can really drive children’s attainment in schools, especially children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, so this is why we’ve asked Kevan to look at all options.” Sir Kevan suggested this week that school days could also be extended to help pupils catch up - and recovery could take until the end of this Parliament in . Unions branded the plan a “distraction” as teachers scramble to prepare for the massof pupils to the classroom on Monday. NASUWT General Secretary Dr Patrick Roach: “Teachers and school leaders do not need this distraction from the Education Secretary. They are working hard to finalise their preparations to reopen fully on th March.” He added: “Rather than dredging up tired ideas Gavin Williamson should be focusing his time and energy on supporting the work of teachers and schools, ensuring that schools reopen safely on Monday and that everything that can be done is done to keep them open.” Kevin Courtney, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union, warned ministers against piling fresh pressure on teachers.  “Any proposals to change term times or holidays will need to consider that teachers already work more unpaid overtime than any other profession, and that excessive workload is the reason that many teachers and school leaders leave teaching,” he said. Mr Williamson also resisted pressure to tighten up rules on wearing face coverings in schools after complaints the lack of clarity could create mask anarchy. Secondary school pupils will now be told to wear masks in the classroom as well as in the corridor when theyto the classroom on Monday.  The guidance is not mandatory and is expected to be reviewed at Easter. Primary-age children do not need to wear masks under the rules. However No was dragged into a row earlier this week when it emerged that Redbridge Council, in London, was encouraging their use in primary schools. Tory Education Committee chairman Robert Halfon warned this week that ministers risk creating mask anarchy unless regulations on face coverings in schools are made clearer. Mr Williamson said: Unlike shops there’s a whole series of controls that are in place in terms of schools.

The Chancellor said his plans would protect jobs and livelihoods, but the truth is they will inflict a further squeeze on living standards and cut spending on key services. His words will sound especially hollow to those set to be robbed of % of their income when Universal Credit is cut in September. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation calculates this will push half a million people, including , children, into poverty. The crafty Chancellor also stands accused of using taxpayers’ cash for political advantage.

Kelly Gibson and Stephen Gilbert, both , snapped up the two-bedroom house in Cheadle, Manchester, four years ago for £,. Since then they have pumped £, into turning the rundown property into an impressive three-bedroom house which has doubled in value. Stephen, who is a joiner, did most of the work himself which allowed the couple to spoil themselves with the cash they saved on labour costs on features such as a state-of-the-art kitchen and a built-in sound system. Kelly, who works as the manager of a vets surgery, told the Mirror: We have been saving for  years to buy our home.Have you got a home makeover story to tell  Email webnews@mirrorWhen we bought this house it was rundown with two small bedrooms, a tiny kitchen and a bathroom that was small it couldnapost even fit a bath in it. We knew it would need a lot of work but luckily Stephen was able to do it himself. The first thing we did was gut the house throughout before Stephen built an extension at the side. We also ripped the kitchen out and knocked through the back wall. The bathroom was the last room in the house to be done. During the massive transformation project the couple were forced to move out for six months as they were left with no kitchen and bathroom. Luckily both Kelly and and Stephenaposs parents were happy to help them in their quest for a dream home. We moved into my parents home for a while and then into Steveaposs, Kelly said. The house was like a shell then. We had ripped everything out. The project was also stalled by the coronavirus pandemic as it became tougher to source some materials.Kelly said: There were times we couldnapost get hold of things such as plaster because companies had been forced to temporarily close. But Kelly said the pandemic also meant the couple had extra cash which would have usually been spent on holidays abroad. We really wanted to treat ourselves with some things which is why we spent so much on the kitchen, she said. I also sourced lots of things from Instagram and Etsy stores with many sellers making items to my specications.Although the stores are closed I was able to order things online so bought items from shops like Dunhelm, Next and Zara which were delivered to my home. In my bathroom I have reusable bottles too so Iaposm helping the planet. While Stephen carried out the building work Kelly and her mum rolled up their sleeves and did all the painting themselves - which save them hundreds on decorating costs. Steve is quite bland and would be happy to have the house all white but I like colour so I took over decorating with my mum helping me, Kelly said.I got inspiration by looking at other peopleaposs ideas on Instagram and Pinterest and while Steve was doing all the extension work me and my mum were decorating. Everything just came together really well. When the couple decided to renovate the property they had a budget of £, so they have spent thousands more than planned but Kelly has no regrets. She said: Weaposve gone over our budget by £, because we splashed out on some more expensive items including £, for a projector and we thought we could change things without having to move the gas meter but in the end we did and that cost £,. Most people would go to BQ to keep the costs down but we went all out and itaposs worth it.  The transformation has not only wowed Kellyaposs family and friends as she has attracted legions of fans after putting images of the fruits of the coupleaposs labour on Instagram. When I started putting pictures on Instgram people were amazed that I was not an interior designer, Kelly said. Now people are telling me I should do interior designing as a living. The house isnapost % finished as there are still little things that need doing. Iaposm currently obsessed with pampas grass and I need to get over that as itaposll take over every room in the house!! Despite wanting to put finishing touches to every room in the house, there is one that is perfectly finished.

Shocking footage captured the moment NHS worker Ziggy Desmond Mombeyarara was detained by police.He was taken down by a cop with a Taser after being clocked doing mph in a mph zone on May  last year, Manchester Evening News reports.Mombeyarara, , went on trial at Manchester Magistratesapos court following the incident and was found guilty of obstructing two police officers. Prosecutors said officers repeatedly tried to conduct a roadside breath test, but Mombeyarara refused, keeping his arms folded and making no real attempt to cooperate. As PC Anthony Hannan went to arrest him a ‘scuffle’ broke out, resulting in the Taser being withdrawn. Mombeyarara ignored the requests to put his hands behind his back and walked round to the other side of his car, removed his screaming child and held him as he pushed back on PC Bielizna. He eventually let go of the lad - shortly before being Tasered by PC Hannan. Mombeyarara, from Trafford, had entered not guilty pleas to two offences of obstructing a police officer, driving whilst unfit through alcohol and a breach of the Covid lockdown rules.  He had already entered guilty pleas to offences of speeding and driving with no insurance. Prosecutor Nick Smart told the court that at around .pm officers spotted a blue BMW driving at speed along Chester Road, Stretford, and activated their blue lights. As Mombeyarara came to a stop at the BP garage, PC Stephen Bielizna arrested him for speeding before both officers suggested he was drunk due to his ‘glazed eyes’, ‘slurred speech’ and being ‘unsteady on his feet’. “The second officer, PC Hannan, spent a period of time questioning the defendant and asking him for a roadside breath test,” Mr Smart said.  “The defendant agreed but did say: “I’m asthmatic” and it was at that point matters took a turn for the worse.” It was said that Mombeyarara gave ‘no real attempt to comply’ and became ‘more and more restrictive’ towards the officers, culminating in the Taser being drawn. Giving evidence, PC Hannan said: “I told him to put his hands behind his back because of my concern regarding his behaviour. “His immediate response was ‘No, I canapost, Iaposve got a kid’. “I got hold of one of his hands and he took hold of my hand and squeezed and I remember saying ‘do not, do not, do not take hold of me like that’. “He then began thrashing his arms out and I tried to take hold of his hands which was unsuccessful.” He added that the defendant was ‘puffing his chest out’, ‘clenching his fists’ and had his ‘teeth together’.

Jordan Parks, , from Doncaster, had her two newly born kids registered as unidentied twins due to them being conceived at dferent times. This is so rare itaposs something said to happen only once in  million times. Jordan said she and her partner had given up on having more kids as her polycystic oy syndrome meant she needed fertility treatment for her first one Freddy, who is now three. Having been unwell during the hormone treatment she decided she didnapost want to have to go through it again. So when Jordan found out she was pregnant with two babies during a -week scan, she thought it could only be a miracle. Jordan is said to be one of the  or so cases in the world of superfetation twin pregnancy, which saw her fall pregnant with her son, Arthur, now , and then fall pregnant again nine days later with her daughter, Aubrey, now .Have you beaten the odds to give birth  Let us know your story by contacting webnews@mirrorI have heard that superfetation could happen with animals, but I never in a million years thought that it would happen to me, Jordan said. It is so insane to even think about it. I just couldnapost believe it. When I tell people about my pregnancy sometimes they donapost even believe that is it a real thing. They are so shocked. After having their first child, Jordan and her partner, Jason, , were desperate for another baby but decided against it and that they would enjoy le with their baby boy.  In February , Jordan came down with what she thought was a vomiting bug. She said: I felt like death. Jason had said to me that I had only ever previously been this ill when I was pregnant. I never expected to be pregnant, but I bought a test to double-check and it came back positive. I was absolutely gobsmacked. After being told I was infertile, I could not believe my body had done this. It was a miracle.  After a fall a few weeks later, Jordan booked a private scan to check that her baby was okay. She had experienced some spotting and says that she didnapost feel pregnant. Jordan, a plasterer, said: I was so anxious I just needed to make sure that everything was okay and the hospital wasnapost able to do a reassurance scan. So, we booked a private scan. Jason and Freddy came in with me to hold my hand. The sonographer started the scan and asked meI was ready. She then went on to say aposthereaposs oneapos and I had no idea what she meant. I thought she meant one oy. But she meant one baby. And thataposs when we were told we were having twins. I was looking at them and one was so much bigger while the other just looked like a little tiny marble. I started to panic. I thought the smaller one had maybe passed away and thataposs why it wasnapost as developed. I was frantically asked why it was like that.  The sonographer continued to explain to Jordan that one baby was ten weeks and two days, while the other was just nine weeks. Jordan was told that she had conceived twice and fallen pregnant again nine days after originally conceiving. The mum-of-three said: I was in utter shock. It was so much to take in and I didnapost know what to do. Firstly, I couldnapost believe I was going to have two babies, and then secondly this incredibly rare thing had happened to me where I had gotten pregnant twice, after believing Iaposd never be pregnant again. It was crazy. At a  week scan, Jordan was informed that Arthur, who she had conceived first, was thriving and the smaller baby was not and her brain was full of cysts.  Jordan says that they were told to not expect her to survive the remainder of the pregnancy. She added: For the whole of my pregnancy you could see how much smaller she was. We were told she was more than likely not going to make it. The doctor told us that she has never seen a baby in this condition make it through. I was even advised to terminate Aubrey to help Arthur and give him a better chance. Jason and I sat down and had a big discussion about what we wanted to do and we decided we didnapost want to terminate and we would just let the pregnancy take its course. Two weeks later we went back for another scan to see how things were. It felt so sombre and as though they were preparing to tell us that she had passed away.  However, it was another miracle. We were told that all bar one of the cysts had disappeared and that the baby would survive, although she would probably need to spend a while in NICU. I couldnapost believe that around two weeks ago we had been advised and were talking about terminating her, and now she had made this miraculous recovery. I was so grateful we chose to carry on with the pregnancy. From this point everything  in the pregnancy went fairly smoothly, it was quite a breeze actually. At  weeks, my waters broke and I underwent an emergency C-section and had my babies.  There was exactly  lbs dference between them. Aubrey was born first at  lbs  oz and Arthur was  lbs  oz. I was warned that Aubrey may have to be taken to NICU, but to everyoneaposs amazement once again, she didnapost need to. Arthur was actually the one who needed to go to NICU where he spent three days due to having a sticky lung. It was so scary as I had been told the whole time that he was the healthy baby.

Hewitt, , had a five-year affair with Diana that began in  during his time as a cavalry officer. He is now said to be working as a gardener in the grounds of the flat he lives in with his elderly mother. He was seen this week driving a mower and raking leaves on the tranquil Devon estate, reports the MailOnline. Fellow residents in the th century manor house however suggested he may not be as green-fingered as he appears. One claimed he had mangled an ancient Yew tree in a failed attempt to make it look regal and shape it like a wine glass. Pauline and Barry Presswell, who have lived in the building in Farringdon, near Exeter, say they fell out with him over the tree.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family  Sign up for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Mr Presswell, , told the Mail : He made a dogaposs dinner of a beautul -year-old yew tree which we can see from our window and used to love.While Mrs Presswell, , said the tree had been reduced from ft to ft and now it looks like an octopus. She said Hewitt hired a tree surgeon to help with the job, adding: I went down to try and stop them and even said I would stay there until they stopped. But I was too late. Hewitt was previously living in Marbella running a bar. But when the venue shut down, he he moved into his motheraposs £, two-bedroom flat. Princess Diana admitted to her affair with Hewitt in her  Panorama documentary.She admitted her relationship with James Hewitt, a former British cavalry officer, was more than friendship and confessed that she loved him. But she also revealed that when he published a book in  disclosing their affair, much of it was fantasy and she was absolutely devastated about the fact she had trusted him. Mostly, she was concerned what the reaction of her two young boys, Harry and William, would be.However, when the book did hit the shelves, Prince Williamaposs reaction was mature, loving and totally heart-wrenching - even though he was just  years old at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"real life ace ventura pet","story":"NewsReal le Ace Ventura pet detective hunting dog thieves after catching serial killersEXCLUSIVE: After jailing serial killers, drug gangs and armed robbers, former detective inspector Colin Butcher is now using his skills to tackle the new breed of dog thieves prospering in lockdownmirrorShareCommentsByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  MAR NewsSleuth Colin Butcher is in high demand and seeing it rising \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Just ask former detective inspector Colin Butcher, who has been recovering pets for more than  years. As a police officer, Colin came face to face with some of Britain’s most hardened criminals and helped jail serial killers, drug gangs and armed robbers. But since leaving the force, he has faced new challenges. Since , he has helped shut down more than  illicit breeders and fake rescue centres, as well as exposing puppy farms and animals taken by professional dog walkers. His successes also include recovering stolen cats, racehorses, alpacas, parrots, snakes, a hamster, sheep, and pet birds. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section But in the past year, since the first lockdown, the number of dog thefts have soared and most of Colin’s work is on the scent of heartless thieves. He receives about  frantic calls or emails a week from distraught owners. The former Surrey and politan Police forces officer, who set up the UK Pet Detective Agency, said petnapping is now big business as the price of ­pedigree and gundogs rockets. Colin, , said: “We are witnessing a big increase in opportunistic dog theft right across the UK. The thieves are usually career criminals always on the lookout to steal something of value. Dogs are being stolen from cars and back gardens, so dog owners be careful. “ has been the worst year on record for dog theft. We have seen the same level of crimes during January  as we did last year. My advice is do not take chances and never leave your dog unsupervised.” We joined him on Tuesday afternoon at the scene of his latest investigation. Four days earlier a two-year-old red corgi Amber was stolen from the home of -year-old Barbara Parker-Milligan as she sat in her conservatory. Her son, Douglas Embelton, , who lives with her in Yateley, Hants, was picking up her prescription and shopping. Nothing  was taken from the property. Douglas said: “I’m absolutely heartbroken. Barbara was so traumatised by the burglary that she collapsed and had to be rushed to hospital on Saturday.  “I can’t sleep or eat. I am worried sick Amber is not being treated well. We are desperate for anyone who knows of her whereabouts to get in touch. “She is part of the family and we just want her home unharmed.” After obtaining CCTV footage and making door-to-door enquiries, Colin, who charges £ an hour for his services, suspects she was taken by men known to Amber’s owners. He said: “The thieves had previously been touting for business trying to get the occupants to have their front garden wall fixed. They had been turned away about six times. “But on Friday afternoon when Doug was at the supermarket he saw these men again. They arrived at the property minutes later. This is a targeted theft. The heartless thieves crept into the house while an elderly lady was indoors and stole the family dog.”  Douglas said: “Although we reported the burglary to the police, I contacted Colin as I felt not enough was being done to find Amber. It might cost us several thousand pounds but we are determined to get her back.” In the village of Lydd in Kent, at about the same time Amber was stolen, an elderly lady was walking her pugs when a man in a balaclava swiped one. The pages of Doglost are crammed full of similar details of ­thousands of stolen beloved family pets. For the dognappers it is easy money and the risks are low as only about % of dog thefts end up in court. Eventhey do, the thief will most likely receive a small fine of around £ or a suspended sentence, often with the dog not ed.  But a thief could steal one dog that is then bred for five years making them thousands of pounds. Based on freedom of information requests to police forces, Dr Dan Allen, director of geography at Keele University, found about , dogs are stolen each year. Colin suspects the true total is much higher but said accurate figures are unavailable because dognapping is not recorded as a specic crime.For example,a dog is taken with other goods, it falls under theft. Google searches for “buying a puppy” increased by % in just one month of lockdown, with registered breeders unable to meet the rise in demand. The price of a pug leapt from £ to £, and French bulldogs from £, to £,, according to welfare charity Dogs Trust. A dog’s breeding potential also makes them valuable. Colin said: “Police have cracked down on illegal puppy ­smugglers, so thieves are turning their attention to other people’s dogs to meet the demand. “I’ve heard of teens riding around on bikes who put their arm through the gap in a car window and steal the dog. They are then sold for £ online.

Dogs have been snatched on walks or outside shops.” He also warned of drug users turning to dognapping and unscrupulous breeders hiring Airbnb properties to pretend it is a family home to get round new laws stopping commercial traders selling kittens or puppies. He said many thieves lurk online, checking for people posting pictures of a new puppy or they target kennels and breeders. Many crooks can now find a dog’s microchip and remove it.

Has there ever been a worse bunch of moaning, entitled, preening, selfish, egotistical, privileged, indulged and out-of-touch narcissists who think the entire world revolves around them  Hospitals are stuffed, people are still losing their lives, unemployment is rising and thousands of shops and pubs are closing. Yet all Team Meghan and Squad Queen can think of is settling old scores. What is your view  Have your say in the comments section I hope they’ve sedated ailing -year-old Philip Mountbatten in St Bart’s, so the former naval officer who risked his le fighting Hitler and Mussolini is unaware that his uncivil warring family is machine gunning itself. We know from Diana Spencer that a Royal Family obsessed with rank, rules and protocols is freaky and banishes those who do not conform. The Disney fairy tale of golden coaches and castles clearly turned into a nightmare for Ms Markle. Curtseying to her granny-in-law and playing second fiddle to sister-in-law Kate never happened in her dreams. A family harbouring Prince Andrew brings shame on itself. And the latest bullying allegations suggest that Harry and Meghan need to realise that people in glass houses really shouldn’t throw stones.

Locked away from family, friends and the hope of reaching their dreams, it seemed to Adeola to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. But unlike so many people, Adeloa didnapost think, someone should do something about this, she thought: I must do something about this. Which is what makes the -year-old from Bexley, south east London, so inspiring. Since then – in addition to holding down a day job with a charity, in early  she set up Uplt The Next Generation – an organisation focussed on opening up opportunities for teenagers from underpriviliged backgrounds.Through a range of masterclasses,  sessions and networking events she aims to show teenagers that anything they want to achieve can be possible. When the boys I knew went to prison I realised that it wasnapost just something that had happened to them, it was something happening to so many guys round my area who went down that path, says Adeola. I thoughtI donapost do something to change things, then who is going to do it  Adeola had already been a volunteer with Girl Guiding and President of the Biomedical Society at the University of Wolverhampton where she had fought for greater career opportunities for students. But still she found time to set up her first Uplt event – where she invited local teenagers and their parents to an evening where they met professionals from a range of careers. Since then – in addition to holding down a day job with volunteering charity NCVO - she has repeated the events, set up a website and organised a series of webinars for teenagers struggling with motivation during lockdown. The online programme includes practical support on things like writing a CV, organising finances and career opportunities, as well as advice on mental wellbeing and self confidence. Adeola says: There is a lot of uncertainty for teenagers at the moment, particularly with things like some of them not being able to take exams or not knowingthey not having been able to take exams or not knowthey are going to get into university or apprenticeship. But there are a lot of organisations offering these young people opportunities too.

The tip also applies to other supermarkets and staff say it helps to solve a very “frustrating” problem for them.A woman shared the top tip in the Aldi Mum’s Facebook group - and it quickly sparked a discussion online.The customer said shoppers should take care to not put similar products in the same bag - such as red and green peppers. Because they have dferent item codes - and in some cases, prices - checkout staff have to remove them from the bag and scan inidually, which slows down the process.According to the Sun, she wrote: Just a little tip to make your fruit and veg a bit easier for the register staff.“Separate colours of fruit such as peaches and nectarines, as well as red and green peppers. “Eventhey’re the same price, they’re not the same item and require dferent inputs.

She says: Okay guys, I donapost normally film these types of videos, but like I see this girl over there across the street, Iaposm literally about to go out but she looks really uncomfortable. I donapost knowsheaposs going somewhere, itaposs like really late at night. She turns the camera to show the girl is being talked to by a man dressed all in black, with a black hoodie, black pants and black face mask. Okay Iaposm from New York, girls supporting girls, Iaposm just going to go up to her... Nab then walks across the street and as she gets closer, she pretends asshe knows the other girl and says sheaposs been waiting for her at her car.  She then asks who the man is and what he wants. The man says he was just talking to her and when questioned about what, he bizarrely responds: Just asking herher... toes are long. Disturbed Nab turns back to the other girl and says we gotta go and that she doesnapost think this is someone they should get to know. The two girls then run off together, with Nab offering her a ride to wherever she needs to go to ensure she arrives safely.

This was the case for one couple who recently rented a home in Los Angeles, moving from San Francisco.TikTok user @vtmegs revealed she and her husband had rented a home in LA, a six-hour drive from their previous property and had jumped the gun in signing a contract after a -minute viewing.It was only after moving into the new place, that they discovered there were a few odd things they hadnapost noticed during their visit.In a viral video on the social media , the woman shows how she discovered a hidden basement in the house and brands it a nightmare. She says: Alright so we just rented a new house and we have this pantry and weaposre wondering why the pantry door has got these locks, because itaposs literally just a closet. And so I open the door and noticed what looks like a hatch in the floor. WTF is this   I am legit freaked out by this because they did not mention a basement or anything in the listing, so Iaposm gonna open this.  She opens the hatch door to reveal a set of stone steps leading down into darkness. Yeah... NOPE, she proclaims as she shuts the door back up. In a follow-up video, the woman then shows off a number of security cameras installed in ious rooms around the house, including the master bedroom, one in the spare bedroom, in the dining room and another in the living room. The couple later found all of the wires connected to the cameras lead to a closet downstairs.

recognise and thank another band who have kept a vital leline going over the past troubled year – our newsboys and girls.These doorstep heroes make sure the Press and Journal and Evening Express drops through the letterboxes of people from all walks of le, right across the north-east, from inner-city tower blocks to remote rural settings.Every day, they deliver the news and information people need, especially as we are all in the frontline of the battle against Covid-.But our newsboys and girls have risen to the challenges set by the pandemic in ways far beyond delivering your newspaper to your home.They have shown kindness and compassion countless times, from taking out bins and offering to collect shopping and run errands for vulnerable customers. They have even saved some of our older customers from medical emergencies.The young stars in our home delivery team know the value of a friendly wave, a kind word, or a bit of a chat with people feeling isolated and alone.The many letters and calls we have received from customers praising our newsboys and girls, thanking them for making lockdown that bit easier, has been truly humbling and inspiring.I could not be prouder of them. They reflect the values of serving and supporting the people of the north-east which is at the heart of the Press and Journal and Evening Express.So when we take a moment to be thankful for all the

a - draw when a shot hit Tommie Hoban’s arm from close range.Then, in the - defeat to Celtic on February , referee Alan Muir failed to award a penalty to Aberdeen when Stephen Welsh handled the ball in the box.McInnes believes VAR would have claried, and brought a consistency of decision, to both incidents.He said: “I would have VAR in Scotland all day long.“I even think that we could have a diluted version of VAR.#I think a referee could easily be hooked up to a screen.“We can see incidents on an iPad in our dugout within  seconds.“We have the ability to do that as most teams do nowadays.“We can see incidents straight away.“If that could be on one of the big screens you get down the road, without having someone  sitting where, it would be no harm for the referee to go over and see the incident again.“You might not get every decision right with it, but I think you would get more right by having another look at the incident.“I think that makes so much sense — and that’s without all the expense.”VAR is utilised in the English Premier League and many of Europe’s top isions and allows refereeing decisions to be reviewed.The SPFL say it costs too much money and we all see down the road it is still not perfect and it drives people nuts at times.#But I think on key decisions it’s worth it.#You might not eradicate offside calls without the technology, but you can look at handballs, simulation, penalties.#Derek McInnesSPFL Chief Executive Neil Doncaster has previously stated the cost per season to implement VAR in Scotland would be at least £ million, which would be too prohibitive, particularly in the current climate with Covid-.McInnes said: “The SPFL say it costs too much money and we all see down the road it is still not perfect and it drives people nuts at times.#But I think on key decisions it’s worth it.#You might not eradicate offside calls without the technology, but you can look at handballs, simulation, penalties.“I think the referee would feel more comfortable awarding the decision having looked at it again.#How many times have we thought something at the time and realised when you see it again that you were wrong.#You might not have the lines and all the technology, but I still think a referee could look at a screen and be a bit more comfortable with his decision.”McInnes was left both baffled and frustrated the incidents with Hoban and Welsh could result in such dferent decisions.The penalty against Hoban in the - draw cost the Dons two points and a win.Likewise, had they been awarded a spot-kick in the - loss to Celtic,converted it could have secured a draw and a point.All vital when four points behind third-placed Hibs # with only seven games remaining in the Premiership campaign.McInnes placed a call into the referee department at Hampden recently seeking some clarication.It was not forthcoming.McInnes, whose side host Hamilton tomorrow, said: “I still wasn’t given a satisfactory answer when I phoned the referee department the other week.#Tommie Hoban had a penalty given against him at St Mirren and  Stephen Welsh last week against Celtic had his hands in the same position, the distance was almost identical.“However, Alan Muir did not give us a penalty, but Bobby Madden gave St Mirren a penalty.“I said at the time,Bobby is right then Alan is wrong and vice versa.#But both referees still think they are right and I don’t understand it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"

Highland League clubs have been #backed into a corner# over theof the Scottish Cup.The seven Highland League clubs were given little notication, according to Hale, of the proposedof March , when the outstanding second round ties are due to be played.Hale also feels the estimated cost of three rounds of testing for players # now required to participate in the competition # given by the Scottish FA is much lower than the reality, as clubs have found.The Black and Golds are due to face Dumbarton in less than three weeks, with a lack of training time and facilities also a pressing concern. It is detracting from the prize on offer for Huntly, which would be a plum home tie against Aberdeen.#It does feel that way, like we#ve been backed into a corner,# said Hale. #There was no prior consultation to noty the seven clubs and they were asked to play their ties imminently.#We need to arrange prior testing and the cost of that is more expensive than what the SFA advised it would be. The club is actually going to lose money to play the game, based on buses and testing costs over a three-week period.mdash Huntly Football ClubMarch , #It#s been made, from their perspective, that they are supporting clubs to get back playing, when in reality it#s #this is the tie. If you#re not happy, don#t play#. That doesn#t sit well when it#s supposed to be a national competition.#There#s pleasure and satisfaction in that we#re able to get back to some competitive football. But there#s disappointment in that the SFA have thrown a date at clubs and they now have to deal with it.#The ongoing regulations regarding Covid- in Scotland mean training is an issue, with public facilities shut down and other sites at a premium.Players have also been off longer than they ordinarily would be for pre-season, yet are faced with a turnaround of just over a fortnight to get them match-ready.The cost of participating, in what could just be for one Scottish Cup game, may well run into five figures, once testing and any travel arrangements are finalised.#Before this, the feedback was we were going to get three weeks preparation before any football resumed,# said Hale. #But the reality is we don#t have testing set up, we don#t have training facilities set up and we have not had a full week#s training since December.#Traditionally players get four weeks over at the end of the season then a five-or-six-week pre-season. Now we#ve had three months off and we#ve got two weeks for what#s essentially the club#s biggest game in the last few years.#There#s been no consultation or offering of financial support from the SFA for testing. It#s a signicant outlay for part-time clubs which has not been considered.#We#re going to have four sessions with the players before the game. It impacts the quality of the product, because all clubs are going to be in the same boat.#Hale believes withdrawing from the Scottish Cup may well have been an option for clubs, evenit would have been unfair on those involved.#I think every club will have discussed it,# he added. #There#s pros and cons to be weighed up.#When you consider the commitment of the players and clubs over the last few months, to get everything up to speed and be compliant with the regulations, it would be unfair to get backed into a corner and be forced to pull out of a competition which they have fully earned their place in.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. vw, px\"  "},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week january 29 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it.

The cost of the items was £., but postage £.!How this can be justied is beyond my reckoning. I have purchased items online where the postage exceeds the cost of the item.

More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 29 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This affects all amateur leagues and leagues with predominantly part-time clubs, although a number of full-time clubs have been affected.A further update will be communicated to the clubs by Wednesday February .Colin Weir of Lochgilphead Red Star attended an online meeting with the Scottish Amateur Football Leagueearlier this week, and revealed that rather than trying to ide the government grant between member clubs, the SAFA plans instead to waive club membership fees for next season.#In terms of Red Star, we’ve been fortunate that our players have continued to pay their monthly fees throughout the pandemic, which should hopefully mean that financially we are in a healthy enough position once football resumes,# he added.Colin remains hopeful that the club might compete in the Centenary Cup,and when restrictions allow, adding: #I would be hopeful, however, thatweto the tier structure as it was pre-Christmas we would be able to at least play some friendlies against our fellow Argyll sides.#By then the players should be resplendent in shiny new strips, as the club awaits delivery of new kit courtesy of sponsor RJD Brickwork."},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter buckets of ginger mischief","story":"Fiona RossUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We’ve brought incomers too: piglets from Cowal, calves from Loch Awe and a flock of wild blackies from Dana. Together we’ve set up home and embarked on a mission to live off the land.It’s funny to call something so basic a ‘mission’ asTom Cruise were about to somersault through a window with a self-destructing message exploding in his fist. For millennia it was how everyone lived, yet now the idea of denying oneself a breakfast of Peruvian avocado washed down with a Calornian almond-milk-latte seems intrepid,not heroic.The most heroic thing that happens here on our croft is the odd rugby tackle of a daft ewe trailing half a bramble bush behind her, or brushing one shaggy highland calf when her two pals are desperate for their turn. Our three girls are almost a year old now and on the ridge below our house with the Sound of Jura behind them they look unarguably majestic, but take a closer look and there’s a bucket of mischief in those ginger-fringed eyes.Take too long preening one young lady and there’ll be four stubby horns threatening the backside of either the groomer or the groomed. The pushiest of these -kilo beasties will then ensconce herself in the salon seat, head thrown back, eyes closed while her gorgeous tresses are prettied.It certainly would be mission impossibleanyone were even to suggest these pampered princesses were plate-bound. Their job is to look pretty and maybe have a wee winch with a handsome local bull when they come of age, but we’re not all veggies here on the croft, so something had to be done.The meat section is a pretty strip of woodland inhabited by three of the daftest, squeakiest saddleback pigs this side of Glen Croe. They’re known as Small, Medium and Splodge in the vain hope of maintaining a strictly professional relationship. Their main carer has, however, been encouraging them to use her as a playground to be climbed on, bounced on and nibbled. She, our eldest daughter, assures me she will still happily feast on sausages when the time comes.We’re already enjoying the two lambs and the ewe who made the ultimate sacrice a couple of weeks ago, so the precedent has been set, but it’s not easy. Easy would be flinging New Zealand chops and Danish bacon into the shopping trolley, but that’s not part of the ‘mission’.

It is always best to check at a farm where it is safe to sledge # please do this.Dee and Fergus Lyon, Fernoch Farm, LochgilpheadSir,The banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority , should stop TSB closing its branches in Helensburgh, Dunoon, Rothesay, Lochgilphead and Campbeltown.These closures will leave only the Oban branch open in Argyll and Bute. Many TSB customers will have a very long journey to reach their nearest branch. Not everybody can use internet banking.The FCA has already pointed out that during the Covid pandemic it will be hard for banks to reach their customers and engage effectively with them on closure proposals.They also pointed out that customers may not be able to get to a bank to make the necessary preparations before the closure, such as transferring to another bank.Instead of just pointing out these dficulties, the FCA should step in and tell TSB not to go ahead with these closures.Leaving only one TSB branch open in Argyll and Bute is unacceptable.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,After an exceptionally challenging year for older people, Age Scotland is seeking their views in the first comprehensive survey of what it is like to grow older in Scotland.The Big Survey explores all areas of le for older people including health and wellbeing, housing, media representation and the impact of Covid-.We hope to gain a better insight into what older people think, experience and care about. Survey responses will help to prioritise future campaigns and shape policy.Older people were asked to shield, the overwhelming majority of deaths took place among the over s and care home residents faced months of separation from family and friends.Lockdown has contributed to soaring levels of loneliness and the absence of regular exercise activities and sports has had an impact on physical fitness.We are pleased to be launching The Big Survey at such an opportune time. This has been a tumultuous time for older people and undoubtedly the past  months have had a profound impact across society.We want to hear how older people#s lives have been affected by Covid, what their expectations are now, how they want to live and what their requirements are for enjoying a fulfilling and happy later le.I would urge as many older people as possible to take part. Each and every response will be considered and they will help shape our policies and our work in the coming years.So please take the time to share your views and help us be there to support older people throughout Scotland in ways that make a real dference.Visit www.ageuk.org.uk scotland to find out more about The Big Survey.We look forward to hearing from you.Brian Sloan, chief executive, Age ScotlandSir,Barnardo’s Scotland foster carers look after children across the west of Scotland, giving them the best chance to have a happier and positive future.But the charity is concerned that the pandemic could lead to a sharp increase in requests to the charity for foster care and is asking for more potential carers in Argyll and Bute to come forward.The pandemic and lockdowns have increased pressure on vulnerable families, with job losses, deepening poverty and worsening mental health which could all lead to family breakdown.Fostering is an exceptional job.We are looking for people who can do a lot of juggling between work, care and home schooling under lockdown.

They need to be able to make that commitment to helping a child settle for a set period of time.It#s more important than ever for people to consider becoming foster carers to ensure the right loving families are available in the right location when children need them. For anyone who is thinking about fostering, it is totally worth it. These children need you andyou have space to love, please consider it.Barnardo’s Scotland Fostering West is asking people over , who have a spare room and the time and commitment to support a child, to get in touch and consider fostering.Comprehensive training and support is offered to our foster carers, including extensive support throughout the application process, intensive induction and regular ongoing training and one to ones, as well as dedicated out-of-hours access to a social worker and a generous financial fee.If you are interested in becoming a foster carer and really making a dference to a child’s le we#re here to help, call    or visit the www.barnardos.org.uk foster glasgow website.Sue Brunton, assistant director for Barnardo’s Scotland Fostering"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 5 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them. After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care. Indeed, it’s clear that this is the most worrying time in recent history to get a cancer diagnosis.At Macmillan, people are calling our support line every day to tell us about the heightened anxiety, loneliness and distress that they are feeling.On our support line – open seven days a week on     – specially trained nurses, counsellors and financial support advisors are available to help anyone affected by, or worried about, cancer. They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support.Gordon McLean, strategic partnership manager in Scotland for Macmillan Cancer SupportSir,Inclusion Scotland, the leading Scottish disabled people’s organisation, believes that planning for the post Covid- Scotland must be about building towards a more inclusive future for disabled people, not back to an old #normal# that excluded a lot of us.As we launch our manesto for the  Scottish Parliament elections, disabled people have told us about the problems they face daily, both before and as a result of Covid-, and what needs to change.Before Covid-, disabled people were already some of the most marginalised and excluded in society.We were more likely to live in poverty, be unemployed or earn less than non-disabled people, and less likely to leave school with qualications, because of the barriers and exclusion we face in our day-to-day lives.The Covid- crisis and responses to it highlighted this, aggravating existing inequalities and generating new ones, and putting the human rights of disabled people at further risk.Going back to the way things were before is not the answer. We don’t want to go back. We want to go forward to a more inclusive future.The manesto # Rights and Renewal # sets out what disabled people told Inclusion Scotland are the most important issues they face and what needs to be done to make a post-pandemic Scotland a better place for disabled people. It has five key asks:I call on all political parties fighting the Scottish Parliament elections and their candidates to pledge their support for disabled people’s Five Asks.Dr Sally Witcher, Inclusion Scotland chief executive officerSir,Our dilapidated roads continue to be raised as an issue by many constituents.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut, much more still needs to be done.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads and that neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long run.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 12 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It therefore has a special responsibility to do all it can to advance the peace process.So, while calling for an end to violence, it is simultaneously supplying the weapons necessary to prolong the conflict.The shameful neglect of this leadership role and continued licensing of arms to facilitate Saudi-led offensives is unsustainable. It is a stance that leaves the UK increasingly isolated on the global stage, with countries including Germany, Italy and the Netherlands already banning the export of arms to Saudi Arabia.The UK government now faces a choice: to join President Biden and live up to its obligations as UN penholder by ending the UK’s involvement in the Saudi campaign, or to continue to act as both peacekeeper and warmonger, undermining any moral leadership it might claim.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,The SNP has voted to conceal Alex Salmond#s evidence to the parliamentary inquiry.The Scottish Conservatives brought a vote to the Salmond inquiry demanding that Salmond’s evidence, much of which is already in the public domain, be published.This would allow Salmond to give crucial evidence in person about the SNP#s botched handling of this case. All the SNP MSPs on the committee, however, voted against its publication, meaning it will not be released.The Scottish public deserves to know the truth of what happened and why £, of public money had to be paid to Salmond.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward.Sir,The personal testimony of the men and boys in the final independent report into non-recent sexual abuse in Scottish football # who have shown incredible courage # demonstrates how needed this independent review has been.The abuse young players have suffered in football is inexcusable and heart-breaking. By bravely speaking up, they provided the catalyst for the review and the changes that will come from it are thanks to them.We welcome the ongoing work the Scottish Football Associationhas carried out in light of the report’s recommendations and encourage them to continue their progress.The SFA is showing it is willing to listen and implement changes that ensure no more children suffer the experiences described in the report.We are pleased to see children and young people’s involvement in the process, including the consultation with the Scottish Children’s Parliament. The voices of children and young people are crucial to developing improvements for their own wellbeing and safety and to change a culture where children can be frightened to speak up.Safeguarding in Sport, a partnership between Children st and sportscotland, has developed the Standards for Child Wellbeing and Protection in Sport, which state children have a right to express their views and have their voice taken into account.

Well done to everyone involved for getting the project to this stage.A broken record we might be, but we make no apology for it.As we have said before, the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland have never taken seriously, really seriously, the issue of the Rest and wider Argyll connectivity. If they had, we wouldn#t be talking about it today.Yes, a lot of work has gone into mitigation. But that is all it has ever been # mitigation and nothing like a solution. And a constant drain on public money.We need new, fresh thinking on keeping Argyll connected.

Options! There is only one possible and that should be obvious.When I first moved to Argyll, driving through Glen Croe was a beautul feeling that I had left the urban areas behind and come out into fresh country. No longer # it is a disaster zone and will remain so for a number of years, and possibly decades,a new  safe road is not built.With the elections in May for the Scottish Government, we should be calling on our  politicians to deliver a suitable road through Glen Croe and to do it soon, not  years  away with no firm plans to do it even then. Our politicians are in hiding and it is time they should deliver.The option should be for a new safe road well away from any landslide so that we, the inhabitants of Argyll, can get back to some normal le.Derrick Anstee, InveraraySir,The neglect of the A is a disgrace.It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said they’d solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardMr Reid is the LibDem candidate for May#s Scottish parliamentary electionSir,With reference to theto school, I do hope that the pupils in Lochgilphead Joint Campus are kept in at lunchtime instead of being allowed to roam the streets like herds of wildebeast, with absolutely no social distancing or the wearing of masks.There is a perfectly good ing canteen restaurant in the school and or packed lunches.There is no need, at this time, for them all to be out and crowding supermarkets, fast food shops, cafes and chippies.This needs to be addressed by the Argyll and Bute education department as soon as possible.Name and address suppliedSir,In a leaflet delivered to every home in the Argyll and Bute constituency, Conservative MSP Donald Cameron claims that the #UK Governmentannounced the Argyll and Bute Rural Growth Deal worth £ million# and goes on to say that he is working with local councillors #including Alastair Redman# to #see what further action is needed#.The Rural Growth Deal, however, is a joint project involving £ million from the Scottish Government and a matched sum from the UK Government as well as more than £ million from other sources.In addition the deal has its origins in discussions between the Argyll and Bute MSP Michael Russell, then Scottish Government Finance Secretary John Swinney and the former leader of Argyll and Bute Council, Dick Walsh, in February . The UK Government only became involved some years later.This would be a very serious attempt at disinformation were it not so ludicrously self-defeating. Mr Cameron is standing to be a member of the Scottish Parliament yet he is trying to airbrush out anything Scottish about the largest investment ever in Argyll and Bute and its future.I hope it is merely ignorance of what has happened here that has led him to so severely misrepresent the truth of the issue, becauseit is political spin then he needs to apologise and withdraw the leaflet.Being pictured next to Alastair Redman won#t help him either, given that Mr Redman is best known for his regular letters to local papers attacking the very Scottish Government that is putting an extra £ million into this area.The Scottish Tories need to decide who they are working for # Boris Johnson in London, or the people of Scotland.Until Mr Cameron sorts his loyalties out, then he can#t be regarded as any sort of contender for the privilege of representing the people of Argyll and Bute.Michael Russell MSPSir,The SNP has committed £, to prepare for a second referendum within the next year.Instead of being focused on Scotland’s vaccination programme and protecting people’s jobs, the SNP’s priority is holding another isive referendum as early as this year.Setting aside this vast sum of money to help preparations for a referendum shows the SNP’s commitment toScotland to the politics of ision all over again.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward"},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast episode 20 the final tee","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures february 26 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Over the course of one to two weeks, the lesions will become even more discoloured and will flatten, and after this they will spontaneously resolve without treatment.A substantial number of these lesions have been seen, primarily in adolescents and young adults with no or only mild symptoms of COVID-. They make up the majority of skin issues associated with the virus. In twointernationalreportson dferent types of suspected COVID-related skin conditions, around  per centof patients with skin complaints reported these lesions.However, given these lesions correlate with mild disease, many of the patients with them in these studies didnrsquot qualy for a COVID- test at the time, and  per centwere otherwise asymptomatic. So while the swt rise of these lesions during the pandemic suggests theyrsquore associated with COVID-, direct confirmation of this hasnrsquot been established. Itrsquos possible theyrsquore caused by some other related factor.The red swelling of these lesions often appears on the top of the toes, close to the nail. Ternavskaia Olga Alibec ShutterstockExactly when they appear is also somewhat unclear. In astudyanalysing  patients with suspected COVID-related skin changes,  per centpresented with chilblain-like lesions. None of the patients had respiratory symptoms and they were all COVID-negative at the onset of their lesions. An explanation is that these lesions appear only after a long delay ndash up to  days after infection.The cause of these lesions has been debated. A possible culprit could be type  interferons, proteins that regulate the antiviral properties of the immune system. The theory is that high production of these interferons might result in patients rapidly clearing the coronavirus, but also causeinjury to blood vesselsand increased inflammation. This would explain the coincidence of mild or nonexistent disease, negative tests and skin damage.Another theory concernsACE, the molecule that the coronavirus uses to get inside cells. It is present on many types of cell, including those in the sweat glands, which are common on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. This could make these areas particularly vulnerable to damage from the virus.Or, it could be thatdamage to blood vessels, caused either by the immune response or the virus, leads to cell death and multiple mini blood clots in the toes.Maculopapular rashThis term describes bothflat and raised areas of discoloured skin.

According to ComparetheMarketrsquos data, based on enquiries via its site, the average cost of a telematics premium has declined four per cent, while overall average premiums have dropped eight per cent to pound.Telematics insurance uses an in-car tracker to monitor driver behaviour. It allows insurers to tailor prices more closely to inidual drivers and is seen as a way of encouraging safer driving among young motorists, who are more likely to be involved in a crash than older drivers.The data also shows that the value of the policies drops off signicantly for older drivers with a non-telematics policy cheaper for  per cent of --year-olds and a massive  per cent of over-s.Dan Hutson, head of motor at ComparetheMarket said: ldquoWhile the average cost of car insurance has fallen as a result of the pandemic, our research shows the cost of telematics premiums has declined at a much slower pace.ldquoThis means that these policies are less likely to be the cheaper option for drivers compared to previous years.

The notion that Scotland, with a mature European economy, is uniquely incapable of tackling our post-Covid challenges tells us more about those who spout these colonial myths than they realise.Brexiteer insistence that walking out of the world’s largest single market will lead to #world beating# trade deals is for the birds.Mr Abendorth#s self-lauded Tory deal with the Pacic is small beer compared to the . per cent hit to Scotland’s economy that Brexit brings in its wake.By contrast, the catastrophic - banking crash was three per cent, which we are still paying for with stagnant wages and food banks.Leaving the EU at the height of the Covid pandemic has been both reckless and unforgivable, as is the price that Scotland is expected to pay for Boris Johnson’s folly.Independence is now an urgent imperative to put the sovereign powers of change back into the hands of the Scottish people.Our dilapidated roads and poorly maintained cemeteries continue to be raised by many of my justiably concerned and upset constituents, including many members of  community councils both on the islands and the mainland.While I understand that our roads department is struggling due to local authority budgets being cut by the Scottish Government, much more still needs to be done.I will, as your councillor, represent your interests and will argue that our hard-working  workforce is given every opportunity to exercise its initiative, to deal with issues at a local level.It has been said to me time and time again that we are fast approaching the point of noand when it comes to our roads neglecting day-to-day maintenance will end up costing us more in the long-run.I will continue to lobby day-in and day-out for better infrastructure in my ward.The Scottish Government’s long-awaited infrastructure investment plan is a big disappointment for Argyll and Bute.The Rest and Be Thankful only gets one small mention – it is to be #enhanced#, but no details and no cash allocated. In contrast, roads in other parts of Scotland have detailed works planned and money set aside to pay for them.After  years of failed attempts at a solution and six months after a major landslide, Argyll deserves better than a vague election promise to #enhance# the road.The only new ferries mentioned are two -metre ferries. These are the same two ferries that were promised in the  infrastructure plan, but still lie in a yard, years late and well over budget. Neither of these ferries is for Argyll and Bute. All we get is vague promises of a #long-term plan and investment programme#.This so-called plan is a shocking neglect of Argyll and Bute.The start of  is proving to be an acutely challenging time for people with cancer, the NHS and for cancer care.

They can provide comprehensive information and advice, as well as emotional support, to help people with cancer cope with the additional strain of the coronavirus pandemic.We know doctors and nurses are working in unspeakably dficult conditions and are having to make tough decisions every day. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to keep cancer care on track, but we also know that some treatment – operations, for example – are being cancelled or postponed because essential services such as ITU are full of seriously ill people with Covid-.What is absolutely vital is thatthere are changes to treatment plans, these must involve the person living with cancer and be communicated clearly.Although some changes may be needed for treatment plans, this is not the case everywhere or for all treatments or tests. Healthcare professionals are doing everything they can to make hospitals a safe environment so it’s really important that people with cancer who have been invited for tests or treatment do attend.GPs are openyou are worried about possible cancer symptoms, and screening and other vital tests have resumed in a Covid-safe way. The NHS is still here for you.As well as our support line, comprehensive cancer information and support is also available on www.macmillan.org.uk and our online community is there to provide invaluable emotional and peer support."},{"url":null,"title":"sailing regatta moved from tarbert","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

At a time when Nicola Sturgeon’s press conferences dominate the airwaves and many national newspapers support one political party, local newspapers are a very important way for people of all shades of opinion to get their message across.I am very pleased that all the opposition parties worked together in the Scottish Parliament and got behind a motion which called on the SNP government to keep giving business rates relief to newspapers and to use its advertising budget to support regional and local newspapers.The SNP opposed this motion but fortunately it was passed by one vote. I hope the SNP will abide by the will of Parliament and not go ahead with its sinister attack on Scotland’s local newspapers.The UK Government has announced a further £. billion in funding to help Scotland tackle Covid-. This additional funding can be spent in the remaining months of - or carried over into -.Scotland has now received an additional £. billion since the pandemic began in March .

We know spring will come as it always does, but will it be like last year  The coronavirus statistics are better, but will there be another surge Perhaps the hope from the emerging signs of spring or the increasing curb of coronavirus is not enough. Perhaps fear of catching the virus, of death coming knocking and of what lies beyond the grave are never far from your mind.

Where does Lent end  With the historical events of Jesus’ death and resurrection. They are why you can have real hope. By his death, Jesus dealt with our sin and failure and defeated death so that we need no longer fear it.

The couple had two sons while living in Kintyre # Jim#s great-great-grandfather Hugh on December ,  and Edward on January , .The family emigrated from Campbeltown in  when Hugh was about three-and-a-half years old and Edward was an infant. They eventually settled in what was to become West Virginia, where William farmed land along the banks of the Ohio River.In America, the couple welcomed three more children # Elizabeth, born on July ,  William Jnr, born on November ,  and Margaret, born on June , .William#s brother Edward followed him to the States in , moving alongside him in West Virginia. Another brother, Archibald, is reported to have emigrated to Wisconsin in .William died of of tuberculosis, aged , on December , , three months after his we died from typhoid fever.Jim, who was an educator in Las Vegas for the past  years and recently retired, said researching his McTaggart ancestry was one of his #favourite hobbies#. He thinks he takes his love of genealogy from his late father, Robert E Cunningham, who recorded his own family history in a publication titled The McTaggart Families ofRobert wrote that, according to the Scots Ancestry Research Society, four place names were associated with the family#s McTaggart ancestors in Kintyre, which were: Achinlene # also spelled Achinglene # Caoranbeg, Knocknow and Glenahervie.Robert added: #These were presumably small villages or crofts where the families lived at ious times before their emigrations. I have obtained Ordnance Survey maps of Great Britain in every scale available, including ones that show highly detailed features of the Parish of Southend, and also a few th century maps of the Kintyre peninsula. Of the four place names above that were associated with these McTaggart families, only Glenahervie can still be found on any of these maps.#Jim told the Courier: #My father tried his best to uncover a link to any source of McTaggarts prior to William emigrating in  but to no avail. My sister Candace and I continue working on finding Scottish relatives, which brings me to contacting your paper.#He is hoping to get in touch with anyone who may be able to assist in locating any of his McTaggart relatives.Jim said: #I enjoy going back to my McTaggart ancestral land in West Virginia to visit the cemeteries, and look forward to visiting Scotland as soon as travel resumes.#I am so amazed that with all of the male McTaggarts in my family#s history, there is no longer one living relative carrying the McTaggart name.#Anyone who feels they may be able to provide Jim with any information or assist him in his research can contact him by emailing mfcnevada@gmail"},{"url":null,"title":"from our files february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The politicians met Andrew Davidson of Ernst and Young, administrators, and David Steele, factory manager in private.#Very useful albeit in dficult circumstances,# was Mr Moore#s verdict. #I hope the administration and management team will be able to work their way through it and Alan Reid will be taking away a number of points to discuss with the Scottish government and others.#Mr Reid added: #With a modern factory, a skilled, committed workforce and the demand for wind energy, it must be possible to find a company willing to take over the site.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOHotel jobs boost for the areaA Glasgow company has announced it is to undertake a £ million refit of the semi-derelict Keil Hotel at Southend.Key Leisure wants to turn the art deco building into a four-star hotel and country club.The hotel has been standing empty since  and is believed to be in a poor state of repair. The company hopes to have the hotel open by mid summer.Key Leisure is part of the Premier Cuisine group which owns several pubs and hotels in the west of Scotland, including the Ingledene Hotel at Ardrossan.The hotel is to be called the Mull of Kintyre Hotel and Country Club. It will have  en-suite bedrooms and a leisure facility including a swimming pool, training room and sauna. Once it opens the development is expected to create  jobs.Mr Brian Morton, managing director of Premier Cuisine, said: #The group feels there is a lot of potential in the Campbeltown area for a hotel and country club of this standard.#He added the local golf courses would prove an attraction for visitors from North America and Europe.FIFTY YEARS AGOEditor#s note: The following article and this week#s photograph are used in historical context and should not be considered the view of today’s Campbeltown Courier. This was, unbelievably, the front page lead story  years ago.Hot pants# they are selling like hot cakesThe cries of despondency from the men of the world rang high when the midi and the maxi skirt looked like taking over from the miniskirt.For the past few ecstatic years, males in Campbeltown had been able to ogle at the lithe legs of the females and the thought of these lovely legs being covered abhorred these gentlemen.However, there is still hope for the leg brigade. Hot pants, it seems, are selling like hot cakes and it already looks like being a short summer!In Campbeltown, the shorts are selling well, especially among girls in their late teens.Most of the girls are buying them for wearing to dances # runner-up to Miss Campbeltown was wearing a pair of shorts # but already one or two have been spotted in the street during the day.The shorts cost, on average, about £. and are made from a iety of materials including denim, silk and wool. Shorts by themselves are going well but the bib type is selling best. The pants are also being worn with midi dresses and maxi coats thus giving the girls the best of both worlds. Popular colours are purple, black and red.Local drapers expect a big demand for the hot-pants in the summer and are stocking up accordingly.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOMishap to SS KinlochThe steamer Kinloch met with a mishap on the outward passage from Campbeltown on Monday, but fortunately it did not prove of a serious nature.When the steamer was approaching Lochranza, and was quite near to the pier, the eccentric shaft gave way, and the vessel had to drop anchor. The weather conditions were good.A telegram was dispatched for the services of a tug, and as the delay at the outset was likely to be considerable, a large number of the passengers landed and proceeded overland to Lamlash, where they caught a boat for the mainland.After a bit, the engineers were successful in effecting a temporary repair, and the Kinloch was able to resume the journey under her own steam.There was no interruption in the service on account of the accident, the necessary repair being completed in time to enable her to take up the inward run next day."},{"url":null,"title":"leader february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Finding a permanent solution might not seem pressing to some of us, while travel restrictions remain in place, but it is causing havoc for the businesses which depend on the route daily.Hopefully pressure from the affected business owners, many based in Kintyre, who are now making their voices heard, will result in a quicker solution.When thingsto normal, the people of Campbeltown are looking forward to welcoming visitors to the most improved place in Scotland, but visitors need to be able to get here."},{"url":null,"title":"letters february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It is very much appreciated. I wish Jimmy a really happy retirement, and would like to thank him for all he has done over the years.I went back to work at MAKI Pups, the new outdoor nursery based in Lochgilphead, last week but I intend to continue with my litter-picking at weekends when I can. I won#t stop now I#ve started.If anyone wishes to help in any way, please phone me on  .There was an interesting letter from Ron Wilson in the February  edition of the Courier which, as with any politician#s pronouncements, was laced with spin, hyperbole or half truths and consequently tells only half the story.Regarding vaccines, nobody, except the SNP, talks about Westminster#s charity. It is my understanding that Great Britain and Northern Ireland are part of the UK and independently opted not to use the EU system and purchased vaccines for itself.This elicited the usual howls of derision by SNP politicians along the lines of: #This idiotic refusal is all about Brexit and nothing to do with the pandemic and will cost lives,# and others of a similar vein.The inept EU vaccine-purchasing system has been and still is chaotic. France, at the time of writing, with a population of  million, has vaccinated . million. Pro rata, under the EU system, Scotland would probably have received , as opposed to the . million currently vaccinated.The electorate keep hearing: #As an independent member of the EU#. This is possibly an SNP aspiration but I think there are several hurdles to an independent Scotland joining the EU.What currency would be used, what proposals are there to meet the EU fiscal rules for membership in respect of the annual GDP deficit which is currently running at . per cent, well above the three per cent required The last figures available for government debt to GDP of  per cent is well above the  per cent required. Then there is the strong possibility of a Spanish veto or perhaps they are proposing throwing Clara Ponsatí to the wolves and saying: #We are sorry we backed the Catalans in order to curry favour with Madrid.#Regarding the EU solidarity stimulus plan, I would hope that it was considerably greater than the UK there are  member countries. I understand that it is € billion, spread over three years, and the grants and loans are subject to strict requirements. I notice that you do not mention £. billion to date allocated through the Barnett formula which is separate from the money. I do not know how much, currently paid to Kate Forbes MSP, cabinet secretary for finance#s department in the furlough scheme.Regarding the comments relating to Brexiteers and leaving the EU as #Johnson#s folly#, it has obviously escaped Mr Wilson#s notice that leaving the EU, liking the decision or not, was a democratic one by the UK electorate and, unlike the EU or the SNP, in our constitution we do not send the electorate back to vote again until such time that they #vote correctly#.Banking crash  May I remind Mr Wilson that it was the Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland which were the main protagonists in the UK which had a serious impact on our economy. Mr Wilson#s rather emotive #gimcrack imperial fantasies# could well have applied to the antics of the two Scottish banks# boards of directors.I am not particularly an avid supporter of politicians per se but the current SNP government by any yardstick is a really appalling administration with a record of declining education, health care and financial mismanagement, just to mention three areas.Leaving aside the first two, what should cause concern is the eye-watering amounts of taxpayers# money wasted. The new Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh is at least £ million over budget and still not fully operative Ferguson Shipyard ferry project, currently £ million and no ferries, projected final cost an additional £ million and no firm delivery date other assorted projects like the BiFab yards, £ million, two of which have been bought by a UK company for £, Prestwick Airport, there is a bit of #smoke and mirrors# but somewhere around £ million is close.A bit closer to home, the Glen Croe problem up to the Rest and Be Thankful, which has been ongoing since  and is regularly subject to closure, has had at least £ million spent on it to date. It is of no surprise that Jim McColl said that #everything the SNP touch is a mess#. Added to that, we have the current internecine Salmond Sturgeon Murrell case ongoing currently swallowed up in excess of £, of taxpayers# money and rising.Mr Wilson is perfectly entitled to his point of view, as I am to mine, but as I said in my opening paragraph, and this applies to politicians of all political persuasions, please present the full narrative not some unsubstantiated wish list.The neglect of the A is a disgrace. It’s not just the long detour via Crianlarich when it rains heavily, it’s the potholes and ruts when we get a spell of cold weather.Three years ago, we had a cold winter and the A became a dirt track. Emergency repairs had to be carried out. The Scottish Government said it would solved the problem. Now we have another cold winter, and again emergency repairs are needed.Other trunk roads in Scotland don’t get closed when it rains or get all these ruts and potholes in a cold winter.We need serious money invested now to solve the A problems. Yet all we get from the Scottish Government is waffle about y public inquiries.  We need money and action now to make the A as reliable as Scotland’s other trunk roads, not more cheap solutions."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week february 26 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth.#Timothy was to be a model of the Lord Jesus, the most loving man who ever lived and yet the one who disagrees with everyone.

The conversations, Kaya hopes, will feel like the discussion that would usually evolve over a cup of tea or an evening pint.Kaya, who begins her residency this month, will record the conversations which will be stitched together as a sound-based artwork called Milk + Two Sugars which will eventually be exhibited on the island for local audiences to engage with and listen to.Over the last few weeks, invitations have been extended to the local residentsin the communities of The Bush and Ballochgoy. To take part they need only call   armed with a ‘cuppa’ of their choosing.The phoneline will be open to two people per day between am-pm on Thursday March  and Friday th, Thursday March  and Friday th. An answer phone message will be available in between times for people to register their interest in taking part.Kaya, who graduated from Duncan of Jordanstone in  with BA Hons First Class in Art and Philosophy in , said: #I begin this residency with a strong nostalgic feeling of connection to Rothesay even though only knowing it through family anecdotes of holidays there. I hope this residency extends these memories into my own stories of the people and stories I come to meet.#With Milk + Two Sugars, I aim to extend these connections beyond a screen and focus on the house phone as my source of extension. I anticipate these oral histories will create an enticing sound landscape reverberated in public spaces for the very community that it captures. The work will also be available to call and hear via a phone number—extending off the island the essence of Bute, those who call it home.#The residency, now in its third iteration, creating an opportunity for emerging artists, whose practice is rooted in social engagement.The Contemporary Visual Art Programme is led by Sophie Crichton-Stuart and curated by Morven Gregor."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns colin joins team scotland staff","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Ed called a meeting at his home on March   to discuss the matter, with  settlers in attendance.A petition was drawn up and signed, asking for the creation of a post office with Ed as postmaster.

If we want children and families to come to the area we need to keep the school open,# he said.Argyll and Bute Council met yesterdaywhen members were asked to agree to hold informal pre-consultation meetings with representatives from  communities that may be affected by the school estate review.The council was also asked to agree to review the school estate #on an ongoing basis# and reducing the future scale of any changes which would be considered at any one time.Now the proposal is for Rhunahaorine to go into Glenbarr and Clachan and Skipness to go to Tarbert.

Not only because it#s convenient, but also to help the commercial centre of the town.#FIFTY YEARS AGOLocal choir on radioCampbeltown Gaelic choir was taped at a concert in the Town Hall on Tuesday evening.The choir will be heard on BBC radio later this month.BBC men recorded a half-hour programme of all-Gaelic songs, which were introduced by Mr Hector McNeill.The choir was conducted by Mr Charles Bonar.

This is in contradiction to what is surely the council#s main aim when setting the budget # saving money where possible.Despite many of KRL#s staff having barriers to working, they do an exemplary job and are happy in their workplace # something which is evident from a visit to the recycling centre. The fact that some of them may lose the jobs they enjoy and do so well as a result of this decision is shocking and heart-breaking.Campbeltown has seen record levels of redundancies over the last couple of years, with more than  lay-offs at CS Wind and Campbeltown Creamery alone, never mind the many people who have since lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. To potentially add to this level of unemployment for no apparent good reason is baffling.KRL not only provides an efficient and cost effective service but worthwhile jobs to people who may otherwise struggle to find employment and are no doubt very concerned about their futures right now.This decision should be reconsidered."},{"url":null,"title":"letters march 5 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I immediately hung up # wondering which of my frailties had been discovered # and phoned  which tells you the last number that called.I twice noted the number given by  and ventured to phone it. On dialling this number, the phone company advised me that there was #no such number#.Over a week, adopting identical procedures, five dferent #no such numbers# were found. The job of answering morning calls was then delegated to the message answering machine and only once did it receive a call which was terminated speedily by the caller without a message.Is there a flaw in our phone companies# systems with consequent loss of income  If this flaw could be eradicated, phone scammers might be less numerous and consequently afford a little more protection for the vulnerable.Going by theof John Newall#s reply to my letter on England#s disastrous Brexit, forced upon Scotland against our democratic wishes, I had expected better than the mishmash of worn out tropes and John Bull exceptionalism trotted out by Mr Newall.Mr Newall makes great play of the successful roll-out of the Covid vaccine in Scotland and the UK. He is absolutely right, it has been a fantastic achievement, but to then go on to use this success to denigrate the EU#s vaccine programme is crass and over simplistic.Our success is an illusion until both doses of vaccine are administered, crowing about vaccines when only . per cent of the UK population has had the vital second jag, compared, for example, to . per cent in Denmark, is both presumptuous and inappropriate.Mr Newall goes on to assert that Scotland has a deficit that will prevent Scotland re-entering the EU, without of course mentioning the elephant in the room, the UK#s ruinous £ trillion # and increasing # debt. Unionists need to get their own house in order before lecturing anyone .Of course, legally, Scotland has no #deficit# or #debt#. How can a country with virtually no borrowing ability have a debt  What Scotland does have is a notional #debt#, the price of Westminster failure within the UK, where spending outwith Scotland#s control is assigned to Scotland, such as Trident, HS and London’s Crossrail. Spending that Scots taxpayers cough up for.Indeed,Courier readers start counting now at the rate of one a second, they#ll reach the number of pounds spent on Boris Johnson’s failed Track and Trace system at about .am on April  in the year . Readers may well wonder where the money went and why this is being loaded on to Scotland#s ledger.Straight from the #Better Together# playbook, Mr Newall brings up the hoary old #Spanish veto# myth. The truth is that Spain has no issue with an independent Scotland in the EU so long as this is within the framework of the UK constitution # which it is.Unlike Catalonia#s predicament, Scotland is not a #region# of the UK, there is no constitutional prohibition on independence votes or indeed of Scotland abrogating the  Treaty of Union with England.This is why successive prime ministers, from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron, have repeatedly recognised the right of the Scottish people to independence # and why Boris Johnson#s oafish #No# will run into the sand.Mr Newall and I will never agree but that is the essence of democracy, and the right to choose in a free country.Scotland can either remain, semi-detached and impotent, as part of an increasingly insular Little Englander Tory Britain, bringing in its wake further austerity and diminished le chances for our young people, or Scots can vote for independence, just like our neighbours.Yes, there will be dficult choices, yes, there will be mistakes, but they will be our decisions to get right as we work for the prosperous, open and internationalist country that is within our grasp.I am delighted that our council will be investing nearly £. million to help keep Argyll and Bute going and growing.After relentless campaigning from myself and others it#s great to see, at long last, some substantial investment in our crumbling infrastructure.Building on investments made in previous years, an additional £. million will be invested to drive forward improvements and repairs to Argyll and Bute#s network of roads in rural, remote, island and urban communities, bringing the overall roads reconstruction budget to £ million for  .We are also investing more in active travel, in line with the council#s agreed priorities. This includes a further £, in enhancing and improving footpaths. This investment complements the current allocation of £, in green transport and travel.This recent Covid pandemic has highlighted more than ever the need to tackle our urban-rural ide.

exacting protocols that were conditional on elite football being given an exemption to continue amid the pandemic.ldquoNonetheless, the continuation of football at all levels has weighed increasingly heavy on me as president, my colleagues on the board and the joint response group as we have watched the new strain of the virus spread rapidly.ldquoWhile national sport has been afforded the privilege of elite sporting exemption, the risk of mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital beds become increasingly scarce.ldquoAfter discussions with the SPFL, the Premiership and Championship will continue on the proviso that both adhere to the existing testing regime.ldquoThe vast

I canrsquot remember the last time I was out for this long!If I were to describe myself, I would say I always have both feet on the ground, but this does not apply during white winters.There is something relaxing about snow that I cannot explain. I instantly turn from a rational person into a dreamer who can spend the whole day outside just watching the white crystals slowly falling from the sky.As I was walking beside the River Esk, the sun came out and made the landscape look special. I walked all the way down to the river mouth, where I sat on the bank to savour the view. Although I was enjoying myself, I also completely lost track of time.I sprang to my feet ready to head back when I spotted something I have never seen before.At first glance, I thought it was a goosander ndash a common resident duck species. It was dficult to have a proper look, as the duck was swimming right against the steep riverbank. I had to look down and lean out over the edge of the bank in order to see it.As soon as its prominent crest appeared before my eyes, I knew it was a red-breasted merganser ndash a winter visitor to the east coast, which I have never had the occasion to photograph.The minute I saw the bird in its full glory, all I could think of was its shaggy lsquolockdown haircutrsquo! I hope you agree with me!Without hesitation, I took a few photos and left the bird in peace.On the way home, I caught sight of a kingfisher that was rushing to his favourite spot for dinner.These ducks can be commonly seen in winter as they travel along the UKrsquos coastline.Their breeding population is concentrated in the north west of Scotland, England and Wales. They can be found in both fresh and salt-water habitats, especially in shallow bays or estuaries.The red-breasted merganser is a handsome bird which belongs to the sawbill family.The term lsquosawbillrsquo relates to the thin and serrated bill, which is designed to catch and hold its slippery fish prey.These ducks can be frequently spotted as they sit low in the water or swim with their head partially submerged.This technique allows them to easily locate their prey and prepare for a e underwater.Both sexes have a prominent profile. During the breeding season, the male develops a dark metallic green colouring on the head, whilst the elongated feathers at the rear of its head form a long and attractive crest.He also gets a white neck collar and reddish-brown breast with black speckles.Outside the breeding season, his plumage resembles the femalersquos, which has a rusty head and crest and pale chest throughout the year.Despite pairing up in winter, the red-breasted mergansers breed in summer.www.facebook zanslens www.instagram zans_lens www

farmland half a mile south of Gullane.It has been uninhabited for more than  years and is today badly ruined and overgrown with noxious vegetation, with nettles and brambles abounding on the site.It was constructed in  or thereabouts by Patrick Livingstone of Saltcoats.An armorial  relocated from the castle to a nearby cottage has the arms of the Livingstone family and the initials of the builder and his we Margaret Fettis of Fawside.The castle has some interesting and unusual architectural features, with a courtyard enclosure and two tall towers to the west, with a vaulted arch between them.A lectern-style doorsquocot was built immediately to the north of these buildings and from its style it has been dated to the mid-th century.Also, in the late th century an outer wall was added, enclosing an orchard and extensive gardens which lay to the north, east and south of the castle courtyard.A lintel over a door in the north wall of the garden carries the date  and the initials GL, presumably for the same George Livingstone who is mentioned in the Records of Parliament as George Levingstoun of Saltcoats in .Saltcoats Castle remained in the Livingstone family until an heiress married Alexander Menzies of Culterallers.Their daughter, Margaret Menzies, married John Hamilton of Pencaitland in , and Saltcoats became the property of that family.Margaret outlived her husband and married secondly William Carmichael, son of the st Earl of Hyndford.She also outlived him and died in , the final resident of Saltcoats Castle.In about , the castle began to be used as a source of stone for local building work, constructing farm cottages and stone walls, and leading to the destruction of much of Saltcoats Castle.Whereas there is consensus that the Scottish population of wild boar was wiped out in the late th or early th century, there are ergent opinions as to where the last specimen was hunted down.One of the claims to fame of Saltcoats Castle is that the last wild boar in Scotland was said to have been killed not far away.The East Lothian postcard kingpin Reginald Phillimore had heard that it was hunted down and slain by Livingstone of Saltcoats, and one of his cards has a vignette of the last wild boar running for its le, with a spear-wielding huntsman in hot pursuit on horseback .As we know, the Livingstone family definitely inhabited Saltcoats at the relevant time, and one of them is said to have received a royal gt in exchange for the head of the last wild boar.According to another version of the Saltcoats boar legend, it was a particularly large and ferocious wild boar that was killed near Saltcoats, not the ultimate specimen yet another version has the valiant Livingstone killing a wild boar that had been terrorising Gullane and its surroundings, being awarded the salt marsh land south of Gullane to build his castle by the king.Saltcoats has an East Lothian rival, namely the hamlet of Prora, near Drem, where a lsquoBoar Stonersquo is said to mark the site where the last wild boar in Haddingtonshire had been slain.This stone used to stand in a field but, since it impeded the agricultural pursuits, it was removed to the garden of Prora Farmhouse, where I have seen it .It was inspected by a party of Edinburgh archaeologists in  and found to be a fragment from a medieval cross, however.The name of Swinton, Berwickshire, originated as lsquoSwinersquos Townrsquo because of the abundance of wild boars in this part of the country.The Swinton family have a wild boar in their coat of arms and there is a tradition that the last wild boar in Scotland was killed near the village.Finally, we have the village of Torinturk, Argyll and Bute, whose name means lsquoHill of the Boarrsquo in Gaelic there are many advocates, on the internet and where, claiming that the last wild boar in Scotland was slain here.Today, there are several wild boar farms in Scotland, from which the tough and canny animals occasionally escape.There are established herds of free-living wild boar in England, and in September , a wild boar was photographed near Fort William, quite possibly the first of these animals to put its trotters on Scottish soil for many a century, but hardly the last, I would think.When visiting Saltcoats, I kept a close lookout for wild boars but found none of them, having to be content with ing home for a meal of Scottish wild boar cutlets cooked the Swedish way."},{"url":null,"title":"new-homes-built-next-dunbars-historic-lochend-lodge","story":"Only one member of the public objected to

products and equipment, are classed as essential as they sell ldquoproducts and tools used in building work and repair and remain open, garden centres and plant nurseries in Scotland were removed from the Level  list of essential retailers on Boxing Day.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced in December last year: ldquoGiven the severity of the situation we face and the need to limit interactions

Over the course of one to two weeks, the lesions will become even more discoloured and will flatten, and after this they will spontaneously resolve without treatment.A substantial number of these lesions have been seen, primarily in adolescents and young adults with no or only mild symptoms of COVID-. They make up the majority of skin issues associated with the virus. In twointernationalreportson dferent types of suspected COVID-related skin conditions, around % of patients with skin complaints reported these lesions.However, given these lesions correlate with mild disease, many of the patients with them in these studies didnrsquot qualy for a COVID- test at the time, and % were otherwise asymptomatic. So while the swt rise of these lesions during the pandemic suggests theyrsquore associated with COVID-, direct confirmation of this hasnrsquot been established. Itrsquos possible theyrsquore caused by some other related factor.The red swelling of these lesions often appears on the top of the toes, close to the nail. Ternavskaia Olga Alibec ShutterstockExactly when they appear is also somewhat unclear. In astudyanalysing  patients with suspected COVID-related skin changes, % presented with chilblain-like lesions. None of the patients had respiratory symptoms and they were all COVID-negative at the onset of their lesions. An explanation is that these lesions appear only after a long delay ndash up to  days after infection.The cause of these lesions has been debated. A possible culprit could be type  interferons, proteins that regulate the antiviral properties of the immune system. The theory is that high production of these interferons might result in patients rapidly clearing the coronavirus, but also causeinjury to blood vesselsand increased inflammation. This would explain the coincidence of mild or nonexistent disease, negative tests and skin damage.Another theory concernsACE, the molecule that the coronavirus uses to get inside cells. It is present on many types of cell, including those in the sweat glands, which are common on the palms of the hand and soles of the feet. This could make these areas particularly vulnerable to damage from the virus.Or, it could be thatdamage to blood vessels, caused either by the immune response or the virus, leads to cell death and multiple mini blood clots in the toes.Maculopapular rashThis term describes bothflat and raised areas of discoloured skin. Astudyof  patients in Spain found that % of patients with COVID-related skin changes had this kind of rash.These were associated with more severe COVID- symptoms, and were mainly found on the trunk in middle-aged to elderly patients. They tended to last - days, appearing - days after infection.A suggested cause is the bodyrsquos immune system going into overdrive. In some patients, ahyperinflammatory phaseoccurs - days after infection, which leads to tissue damage and, potentially, more severe disease and death.HivesAlso known as urticaria, these areraised areas of itchy skin. In astudyinvolving four hospitals in China and Italy, % of COVID- patients that complained of skin changes presented with hives.Hives typically precede or present at the same time as other symptoms, making them useful for diagnosis. They are more common among middle-aged patients and are associated with more severe disease. Viral infections are a known trigger of hives, as they cause the breakdown of cells and the release of histamine through a cascade of reactions in the immune system.Severe urticaria may feel like it is stinging or burning. namtipStudio ShutterstockHowever, itrsquos important to remember that hives are also a noted side-effect of many drugs that have been used to treat COVID-, such ascorticosteroidsandremdesevir.Vesicular lesionsThese are clearfluid-filled sacs under the skin, similar to those seen in chicken pox. They are less common compared to the skin conditions above: in the previously mentionedSpanish studyof skin changes associated with COVID-, only % of patients had these vesicles.However, they are thought to be a more specic indication of someone having COVID- than those already listed, and so are more useful for diagnosis. They appear to present in patients with mild disease around  days after infection.

In fact, without the revenues redistributed from the wealthy regions of London and south-east of England, the Holyrood devolved administration would not have been able to afford any of the goodies she lists, from free elderly care right down to baby boxes.This is a further truth which is constantly avoided by nationalists ndash that independence would mean an abrupt end to all the \"free\" stuff that Scotland enjoys under devolution.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.IF HOLYROOD DIDNT EXIST ...CLARK Crosssuggests that Scottish taxpayers may no longer want devolution and complains about the cost. Perhaps he has forgotten about the hundreds of thousands of the elderly who now benefit from free personal care. Or the many thousands of walkers who enjoy the right to roam responsibly through our wonderful countryside without being banned by the owners of huge estates. Or the freedom to park without charges in an NHS car park when taking an ill person to hospital. Or the abolition of prescription charges, bridge tolls and university tuition fees, to name just a few of the benefits that devolution has brought us.He complains about the huge rise in cost of the Scottish Parliament building since the initial estimate of pound million. Doesnt he remember that this estimate was produced by the UK Government with the sole aim of keeping the estimate under the pound million it was going to cost to convert the former Royal High School building in Carlton Hill  That Donald Dewar was frightened that a parliament high on a hill would fan the flames of independence  That the Holyrood building was commissioned before a Scottish Parliament was even elected  That the original plan didnt even include offices for its members  Everyone is aware that whencommissioning a new building it is vital to involve those who will actually be using it, but the UK Government totally ignored this sensible principle. This was not the fault of devolution, but of those planning it.Lets look at what would have happenedthere were no Scottish Parliament. Scotland would be governed by three Westminster-based ministers. They would be appointed by Boris Johnson and represent a political party rejected over many years by the Scottish electorate.They would come to Scotland for only a tiny proportion of each week as they would have to debate and vote at Westminster. Yes, we would save the money spent on MSP salaries and the like, but is this really what the Scottish people want  I doubt it.Ian McKee, Edinburgh.* IAN W Thomsonis now displaying clear symptoms of the anti-SNP virus which afflicts many who hanker after the good old days when old Labour ruled the roost in Scotland. He describes our Scottish nation as an aberration, adding deep insult to injury by likening us to supporters of Donald Trump.He bases this on his assumption that Scots who vote SNP do so out of obsessive admiration for Nicola Sturgeon and her administrative skills. The truth is that support for the SNP stems from the fact that it is the main vehicle displaying an independent Scotland on its destination screen artillery directed at inidual politicians or the competence or otherwise of our current devolved administration does little to deflect independence supporters from their wish to be part of a nation which chooses its own democratic path.Why Mr Thomson and his ilk retain such devotion to a union created to get the feudal barons who ruled th century Scotland out of a mess of their own creation defies explanation.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.SHAME OF THE POWER GRABTHE UK Government plans to by-pass the Scottish Government and award funding directly to local authorities . And so the well-used strategy of ide-and-rule comes into play.The decision on which authorities will receive funding is reserved to the UK Government, which will no doubt look carefully at voting patterns.Scottish towns will thus be set against each other as they compete for the favours of a Tory Government which has been repeatedly rejected in Scotland.Meanwhile the Barnett formula will be ldquorevisited .Shame on Brian Wilson, once a Labour politician, that he prefers decisions about Scotland to be taken by London Tories rather than by a Government accountable to the people of Scotland .Mary McCabe, Glasgow.ROSS IS BOOSTING SNPTHE rantings of Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross smack of the two-faced hypocrisy we are used to from the Tories.He has called for our First Minister to resign over allegations of a breach of ministerial code . She may very well have made some errors of judgment, the degree and nature of which will transpire over the coming weeks. However, Nicola Sturgeon is positively saintly compared to the likes of Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Robert Jenkrick and Matt Hancock, who all have very clearly recorded signicant breaches of ministerial code. Do you think for a single minute any of these top-rank UK Tories will resign Alex Salmonds recent comments resulted in the support for Scottish independence taking a downward hit. Helpful contributions from the likes of Mr Ross will quickly see the polls positively restored disdain of the Tories is one thing the vast majority of Scots will always unite on.

Nicola Sturgeons popularity with the Scottish public will remain strong.Paul Morrison, Glasgow.PURSUIT OF TRUTH BEING HAMPEREDTHE Salmond inquiry sessions with Nicola Sturgeon as witness have demonstrated beyond doubt the obstacles that the committee has had to try to negotiate. Repeatedly, the peerless Jackie Baillie has alerted Ms Sturgeon to the fact that getting to the truth of the matter has been hampered by the complete lack of cooperation by the Scottish Government in providing relevant documents which exist but have been withheld.At the start of these proceedings, many months ago, Ms Sturgeon promised the committee the complete cooperation of her Government. Why has this been denied Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.* THE SNPrsquos wagons have been circled round their beleaguered leader.

Join a very long line, Ms Fabiani.This event was not as advertised. The First Ministerrsquos appearance was meant to be the point in this saga when everything became clear, when all talk of conspiracy would be silenced. Yes, she acknowledged, a mistakehad been made in investigating the initial allegations against Mr Salmond, and she said sorry to the two women who came forward, and to the wider Scottish public.But after that, going by the First Ministerrsquos testimony, there was nothing  to see or note, so please move on.: Recap of First Ministers evidenceThe first she heard about the complaints was the April  meeting because it was a moment in her le she would never forget .There was no plot to ldquoget Mr Salmond no promise to intervene in the process no intervention one of her officials did not identy a complainer she did not know who leaked the story to the Daily Record and she took the advice of her law officers on whether the Scottish Governmentrsquos case was solid. As soon as they said it was not, the Government conceded.So with all that taken care of, the whole matter would appear to boil down to one angry old man and a woman who was simply trying her best to do the right thing. Just a woman, appearing before a committee, asking them to believe her.If she could be held responsible for anything it would have been being too nice, or not blunt enough, with Mr Salmond.ldquoDid I deal with all of this perfectly  she asked. ldquoMaybe not, but I dealt with it the best I could.At first, the picture of Ms Sturgeon on the screen looked odd, then I realised why. She was sitting down. This is a woman more used to standing at a podium, where she is in control. Here she was on the same level as everyone  present.Not that this in any way humbled her. Why should it  Compared to some members of the committee she was the smartest person in the room. Fluent, confident, defending herself against any perceived slight, she was as impressive in stating her case as her predecessor had been.: Complaint lodged over alleged leak of nameThose hours and days in preparation had been well spent. The soundbites were there, from her refusal ldquoto follow the age-old pattern of allowing a powerful man to use his status and connections to do what he wants, to several declarations of how hurt she had been by this whole matter. There was even a wee touch of the colloquial. ldquoTo be blunt my head was spinning, she said of her mood after learning the detail of the complaints against Mr Salmond.Yesterdayrsquos proceedings involved long periods of boredom punctuated by the odd pertinent question. In the long stretches while her mostly SNP questioners tried to make their points, Ms Sturgeon could have been forgiven for letting her mind drt away. There will come a time, she knows, when all of this will be in the past. All political careers end in failure, said that old bag of wind Enoch Powell, but some failures are better than others.There is the type of failure, for instance, in which the failed one leaves front-line politics for an extremely lucrative career on the international rubber chicken circuit, sets up their own foundation, or otherwise takes a high profile, very well-paying job. Think Tony Blair. Think Nick Clegg. David Miliband. George Osborne. Ms Sturgeon has an international profile. Remember that summer lecture tour to America Always on the right side of any dispute, willing to speak truth topowers, be it Trump in the White House or Johnson in Downing Street, what organisation would not want her on the payroll In this le after politics, much depends on protecting the brand. On the face of it, this entire saga does not look good for her. Except hold on, just look at the optics. All those men, and one in particular, taking Ms Sturgeon on all because she wanted to stand up for women. What a narrative.But back to the here and now. Two years on, after vast expense and much effort, and the clock running on to the Scottish Parliament going into recess on  March, this entire saga comes down to a simple question: who do you believe  Both Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon cannot be right, so who is in the wrong This is no philosophical exercise, the outcome of which does not matter very much. Had a jury not decided as it did, a man would have gone to jail. Besides the obscene waste of public money ndash which must by now be pound million and counting ndash a long shadow has been cast over Scottish democracy.Scotland, the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Government, was not supposed to be like this. Powerful cliques running a government asit was their own private fiefdom. Bills run up on the publicrsquos account without fear of sanction. Mistakes, dreadful ones, being made but no-one resigns, no one is sacked. What are we trying to emulate here ndash Westminster As a certain lawyer said, there is a smell here that is not going away. Maybe not of conspiracy but definitely of incompetence. Not of plotting but of people allowing personal feelings to interfere with their judgment. And supposed to be at the heart of it all, but forgotten by most, are the two women whose complaints started this saga.Ms Sturgeon might have cause to believe she acquitted herself well yesterday, but in coming across as just another politician, appearing to put party above other considerations, she will have disappointed many.A reasonable day for her maybe, not so for Scotland.

It was claimed that the Government were pursuing a ldquodoomed case - a Charge of the Light Brigade ndash in facing down Alex Salmondrsquos judicial action over the handling of his complaints. If legal advice had shown this, as the Scottish Conservatives pointed out, it would have breached the ministerial code. Further wasting public money in such a way would be a potential abuse of funds.However, one thing that became clear today was Nicola Sturgeon was very confident in her rebuttal of these allegations. To some extent this is backed up by looking at the papers themselves. In the First Ministerrsquos own words there was a ldquocatastrophic problem with the way that the government handled the two complaints against Alex Salmond. That was essentially the involvement of the civil servant appointed to investigate the complaint. They had been involved in the process at an earlier stage which fatally tainted the way the policy had been applied.Through the months of legal advice received through  the gradual realisation of this situation as more documents were discovered led the advocates drawing up the opinions to conclude the case could not be won and in Decemberndash weeks before the hearing - this was agreed.

This remained the case up until the evidence of the handling of the specic investigations became clear.Alongside the more balanced reading of the legal advice, it would suggest that it is dficult to say that the government blundered recklessly into the defeat of court action in January . So the charges under the ministerial code would be dficult to stick and explains the confident rebuttal.Dr Nick McKerrellAnother serious charge under the same code is ldquoseverely misleading Parliament which has also been levelled at the First Minister. Ostensibly this focuses on dates that Nicola Sturgeon gave on discovering the allegations against Alex Salmond. She told parliament this was on April ndash there is evidence she met with associates of the former first minister several days before this.:Nicola Sturgeon denies wanting to get Alex SalmondAlthough the detail of this is subject to a specic ministerial code investigation undertaken by a leading Irish lawyer ndash James Hamilton QC ndash the First Minister defended herself on these points. She claimed although she met with Salmondrsquos chief of staff Geoff Aberdein several days before, none of the details of the allegations were shared ndash it was a general discussion on Salmondrsquos attitude and to try and organise the meeting. Thus it did not ldquostick in her memory. The issues around these dates and what was discussed is more dficult to pin down at a parliamentary committee as there is no relevant documentation.Ultimately throughout the day, Nicola Sturgeon argued that her actions were driven by a desire not to abuse her powers to cover up the alleged actions of a former friend and once the most powerful politician in Scotland.If in doing so she breached the ministerial code it seems unlikely it will be on the basis of the legal advice released this week.Dr Nick McKerrell, Senior Lecturer in Law, Glasgow Caledonian University"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley-riddoch-covid-revealed-governments-true-colours","story":"Shell be bringinga unique perspective on issues facing Scots in  exclusively to Herald subscribers.Subscribe and catch Lesleys column every Monday onlineWe asked what she thought of the upcoming Holyrood election, her view of indyref and where she most likes to visit in Scotland...Actually, the late, great Herald features writer Anne Simpson approached me in the s, when I was presenting a daily current affairs programme called Speaking Out.

The British Government tends to makewildly overblown promises on testing, PPE, schooland public services other countries just get on and deliver.It consults inexperienced cronies who win multi-million contracts - but local government, devolved administrations and the scientic community not so much.The Scottish Governments preference for a four nations approach has meant hesitancy and delay, but few seriously doubt their bona fides and trustworthy leadership has bolstered confidence and lockdown compliance.Despite current infighting, and an electoral system that should prevent it, I expect the SNP will win an overall majority. Independence supporters have nowhere  to go with their first votes, Nicola Sturgeon has won new support for her Covid management and opposition parties are still in disarray.It will be the talk of the steamie across the whole of Britain until it actually takes place."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12279676.jpg?type=article-full","title":"linda-bauld-vaccines-giving-us-hope---cautious-route-pandemic","story":"Three months on, we have some answers. None of them are definitive and questions remain, particularly about the longer term. But the answers give us hope.: Budget days odd customsThe three vaccines authorised so far in the UK are from Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-Astra Zeneca and Moderna. All were tested in trials involving tens of thousands of participants with very promising results for preventing disease. The first two vaccines are now being rolled out in Scotland and it is expected that supply of the Moderna vaccine, already being used in other countries, will be available later this Spring.Trial results and review of these by the MHRA and the Committee on Human Medicines show that the vaccines are safe and effective. But efficacy shown in carefully controlled clinical trials does not always result in effectiveness in the real world. We now have studies comparing outcomes between people who have received their first dose and those who havenrsquot.In Scotland, EAVE II is an ongoing project that uses patient data to track vaccine roll out in real time. Last week the research team published a paper looking at vaccine effect since the programme started and up to February . They compared outcomes for people who had received their first dose and those who had not.The study found that by four weeks after the first dose the Pfizer vaccine reduced the risk of being admitted to hospital by % and the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine by %. For those aged over  there was an % reduction in hospitalisation.In England, a further study from Public Health England found a similar % reduction in hospitalisation for over-s from either vaccine. The same study found that the vaccines provided protection against developing symptomatic disease and, for the Pfizer vaccine , an % reduction in deaths. These are hugely encouraging results. But research is needed that looks at the durability of this impact, and effect of two doses of the vaccine. These studies have only been published as pre-prints, which means their findings still need to be peer-reviewed by independent experts.Examining the safety of the vaccines was a key part of the MHRA approval process. They are now publishing regular Covid- safety reports. These are based on the Yellow Card system which is a medicines safety monitoring mechanism. The most recent report covers the period from December  up to February . It shows that only very few side effects are emerging ndash between  and  reports per , doses of vaccine. Almost all of these reported side effects are mild and are not dissimilar to those from the seasonal flu vaccine. This monitoring will continue and the people who took part in the original trials are being carefully followed up to look at any long term effects.Another question was how well the vaccine programme would be rolled out in Scotland. Delivering a programme of this scale is a huge undertaking. There have been a few bumps in the road so far, with unfavourable comparisons between Scotland and England in the early weeks when the pace was slower here.Scotland focused initially on residents in care homes and there are early signs that the first dose may already be making a dference in these settings, alongside staff testing and public health measures. Covid- deaths in care homes have declined by over % in recent weeks.Current concerns have been about the supply of the Pfizer vaccine, with a decline in daily doses in mid to late February. Supply is expected to increase in future. Uptake has been excellent so far and better than the % expected by the Scottish Government in their delivery plan. In fact more than % of people over the age of  have now received their first dose. Whether this high uptake can be maintained in younger groups, and whether there are inequalities in access or uptake between dferent ethnic communities or in more deprived areas, is something we need to watch and address.One of the big remaining questions is whether vaccines will help prevent transmission. If vaccines only stop illness, then everyone needs vaccinated to be protected. Butthey also stop transmission, everyone vaccinated can protect other people as well, which will help us ease restrictions with more confidence.:Coronavirus: Scotlands exit from lockdown hinges on vaccines, iants, and suppliesThere are encouraging signs, including from a Cambridge study which found a signicant fall in infections  days after the first dose in research that tested health care staff. More evidence is needed but many studies are underway that will tell us more in future. The need for other public health measures alongside vaccines will continue for some time to come, but we can now see a cautious route out of this pandemic."},{"url":null,"title":"budget-rishi-dishing-recovery-sting-tail-donald-macleod","story":"Not when so many millions of peoplersquos lives and livelihoods are so perilously close to the edge of the abyss, and who rightly expect in times of national crisis, that their government, their chancellor, puts his neck on the line, head above the parapet and hands into the deep pockets of the treasury in order to bail them out.A job made all the harder when there are hardly any beans in the bank left to count and against all your Tory gut instinct you are forced to borrow hundreds of billion to keep the UK afloat during and beyond this crisis.An eye-watering pound billion, the highest peacetime borrowing figures since the end of the Second World War and, even more startling, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility, our national debt is hurtling towards a back-breaking pound. trillion by the end of .Yet in Rishi Sunak we might now actually have a real chancellor, instead of a spineless chancer, one who is not only up for the challenge, but since he was parachuted in as an unknown backbencher to the hot seat of Number  last February, a month before this deadly pandemic gripped the country, has shown real backbone and leadership, and with fleet of foot danced around his political opponents.

Nerdy stuff, not great copy.So I took a mike. ldquoWere Scottish nationalists paranoid to think the security services were involved in the independence referendum  I asked the giant head.A colleague, from a rival publication - relieved, he later said, at the chance to report something interesting -smiled in encouragement. But as I spoke, I imagined eyes rolling. DAVID LEASK:Independence: Support for independence has changed the face of unionismldquoNo, they are not paranoid, Mr Assange responded, deadpan. ldquoThe attitude of the UK Government is that this is a national security issue, that Scottish independence is, in effect, a threat to the state.\"This mean that the full capacities of the GCHQ, for example, could be deployed.I sat down. I had a tale to tell.But what is really intriguing, I thought ndash I still think ndash is why nobody ever tries to test whether this theory stands up to much scrutiny.Me  I donrsquot believe it does. Mr Assangersquos logic was not new, his is an old story. Some nationalists have been whispering for years ndash more often that not with an air of satisfied self-importance ndash that it somehow stands to reason that they are targeted by spooks because they want to break up Britain.This spy mania is far from mainstream, especially now that the SNP runs Scotland and its leader is a privy counsellor, able to access intelligence.But it is still thereyou look for it a sort of meta-excuse for political failure.These last few weeks, amid lockdown fever and bitter ndash crazy bitter ndash feuding, it has spewed online again.As the Alex Salmond saga reached its anti-climax in the Scottish Parliament, some Yessers tried to make sense of what journalists call a ldquopsycho-drama by inventing Bond thrillers.Julian AssangeType ldquoMI and lsquoSalmond in to the searchof your favourite social media , and you enter a whole alternative reality.There are supporters of Mr Salmond who donrsquot just believe the former first ministerrsquos as yet un-evidenced allegations of a conspiracy against him by Nicola Sturgeon. They also see a hidden hand behind it: spies.And there are fans of Ms Sturgeon who think Mr Salmondrsquos attacks must be part of some deep state plot to stall or stop independence by hurting his successor.But ask anybody with any real experience of government, of secret policing, and they will tell you the same thing: cock-ups are bigger than conspiracies.ldquoIt is not usually the secret services pulling strings, says Phillips OrsquoBrien, professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews, ldquoit is human beings screwing up.For Mr OrsquoBrien, Scottish spy conspiracism echoes some of the dysal social media politics in his native United States.ldquoThere are great similarities with the Trump deep staters,rsquo he said. ldquoSome people like to blame nefarious evil forces. Right now that tends to be the deep state or the intelligence services.He has a point. The security services make the perfect target for conspiracy theories. Because their work really is secret and they never challenge nonsense people say about them.And that means nobody can definitively rule out they are up to no good.But maybe instead of askingthe secret services are meddling in our politics, we should be trying to figure out what anybody would have to gain ndash and lose ndashthey were There is little to gain.For starters, secret police are not necessarily going to be any good at politics: spin beats spies.Just going by their ill-informed chat about Scotland, London Tories probably need a Herald subscription, not an agent in Holyrood.And there is a lot to lose.An illegal use of state secret services would be hard to hide ndash a point, to be fair, which Mr Assange made.ldquoIt would be a very dangerous thing for the UK government to use its own intelligence services to interfere here,rsquo Mr OrsquoBrien said. ldquoDo I know for surethey are or not  No.Are politicians capable of dirty tricks  Well, of course they are. Do they need spooks for that  Of course not.That does not mean we should not be vigilant. The policing, intelligence and security services can cross lines, get things wrong and commit crimes just like the rest of us.Think of the undercover cops who had relationships with women in protest groups. Scummy, that was.We need more transparency, more scrutiny of spooks, not less. But here we collide with an unintended consequence of spy paranoia: an actual call to make secret services less accountable.Since , as a quirk of being the third party in Westminster, the SNP has had an MP, currently Stewart Hosie, on the committee which oversees intelligence and security.Last month the work came under fire, from the SNPrsquos own benches. Kenny MacAskill, a former justice secretary, said it was ldquonaive to think secret agents were not operating in Scotland and questioned why Mr Hosie was part of the parliamentary watchdog. This, he said, writing on an anti-SNP blog, looked like ldquolegitimisation by participation.Ask SNP loyalists about Mr MacAskill and they will sound more sad than angry. But he is badly wrong, irresponsibly so.:Not being from Glasgow or Edinburgh gives me broader perspective, saysDavid LeaskThere may be little evidence of spooks interfering in politics. But that does not mean politics should not interfere with spooks. The SNP should be scrutinising spooks, not fantasising about them.Spy mania is toxic and those of us who call it out can expect to be smeared as agents. I have been. So have other journalists. After all, in the logic of the conspiracist,you deny the deep state, you are the deep state.But, as Scotland gets closer to potential independence, we ought to start getting smarter about intelligence.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The pair using technology to work around Covid restrictions in completing seminars from Business Gateway and obtaining support through Highland and Island Enterprise.Ms Thompson said: ldquoBecause of Covid a lot of people we have been working with have been on furlough or flexi-furlough so a lot of the development of our programmes have been slower than we anticipated, things like our licensing applications, everything is taking a bit longer than we expected because of Covid.The couple, who have travelled the world together, are also keen to use the project to boost the local area and tourism on the west coast.They hope their venture can create jobs and support local businesses, and also plan to use their own experience in the hospitality industry to benefit their employees.Mr Nicholson praised the owners of Ardnamurchan estate in playing an instrumental role in the plans, saying: ldquoJess met the owners of the castle in her previous role at Inverlochy Castle and they saw the potential of her hosting their castle.ldquoThis is such a beautul part of Scotland, and we want people to come and enjoy it.ldquoWe want to boost tourism in the community and create a top food destination for this part of Scotland."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11785147.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ian-blackford-says-indyref2-happen-late-2021","story":"The SNP Westminster leader said, however, that the first priority of the Scottish Government is tackling the Covid crisis.Mr Blackford explained the ldquokey would be putting in place circumstances which would allow for an independence vote to be held.He told the PA news agency: ldquoI want to see that referendum happen as quickly as is practically possible, I think itrsquos in everybodyrsquos interest that that is the case.ldquoBut of course wersquove got to get the election out the way, we need to make sure that the SNP are elected back into government again, that we reinforce that mandate for a referendum.:Scottish independence mdashNew poll finds  per cent in favour of breaking up UKldquoTherersquos a Bill that will be published over the coming weeks and that can be enacted once wersquore on the other side of the election.ldquoOf course what I would say is that the first priority of the Government is dealing with the Covid crisis, itrsquos about keeping people safe, itrsquos about the acceleration that wersquove seen with the vaccine programme, itrsquos about taking off the measures of lockdown as and when we can.ldquoBut we do that based on data, we do that based on evidence, we do that based on keeping people safe.ldquoWhen wersquove got to that position of safety, that would be the right time to have the referendum.Independence supporters march onHe continued: ldquo has talked about a six-month period once the legislation is triggered which could be in June, so it could be the case we could face a referendum as early as late .ldquoBut the key thing is that we put in place the circumstances that allow that to happen, whenever it happens, and that we have an inclusive debate with everybody in Scotland about the kind of country that they want to live in.ldquoAnd it is a choice of two futures.

people identied as speaking Scots, yet much of Scotlandrsquos population is unaware that they possess skills in reading, writing and speaking Scots.Scots is part of the West Germanic language family and is a sister language to English with close affinities with Scandinavian languages such as Danish and Norwegian. Scots has four main dialects: Insular, Northern, Central and Southern, but for me, it was just the way folk spoke in their everyday lives.:Scots word of the week: Mither-leidGrowing up in rural Aberdeenshire, I didnrsquot realise that the way people speak ndash in Doric, a vernacular or byleid of Scots ndash was a special and unique trait of the regions people, lore and history. At the time, I was unaware of the similitude of Scots to other European languages, I was unaware of the languagersquos history and the signicance of the literature written in the language, and I was unaware of its desperate need for recognition and promotion.At , I left Huntly to pursue a degree in traditional music at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow, with my principal study being Scots Song. Since graduating in , Irsquove toured in several countries, released albums of Scots Songs which have been played on national and international radio, won the title of Scots Singer of the Year at the MG ALBA Scots Trad Music Awards and won the title of Young Scots Speaker of the Year at the inaugural Scots Language Awards. My career and artistic practice is centred upon my ability to sing, speak and perform in Scots, yet Scots is not a legally recognised official language in Scotland, despite being recognised under the European Charter for Minority Languages.Without legal status as an official language, Scots is not protected under linguistic equality and ersity policies, and companies, organisations and institutions are not held responsible for recognising the language. I became increasingly aware of this in December , when I tried to pitch my new single, a Scots translation of lsquoIn The Bleak Midwinterrsquo to Spoty playlists. The form asked, ldquoWhat languages are the lyrics in  and despite listing every other minority language of the UK such as Manx, Cornish, Gaelic, Irish Gaelic and Welsh, Spoty had omitted Scots from its language list. It dawned on me that mine and several other Scots language musicians, back catalogues of Scots Songs had been incorrectly listed under English. Three months of social media campaigning, an open letter, a motion in the Scottish Parliament lodged by Clare Adamson MSP, and countless emails later, Spoty finally adds Scots as a language.On th March, I released my new single, The Wild Geese ndash the first song to be released on the  correctly listed under Scots Language. Spotyrsquos move to recognise Scots will no doubt raise the profile of the language. It is incredibly important that a global organisation like Spoty has taken steps to recognise a minority language that % of the Scottish population speak, but I feel deflated that it took so much perseverance to pressure the organisation into recognising Scots, when every other UK minority language was already accounted for.This issue can only be solved with the introduction of a Scots Language Act, which would give Scots official status as a language. Over the pandemic, my tours and performances have been cancelled, and my time has been spent working voluntarily with Oor Vyce ndash an association of iniduals with a personal or professional interest in Scots, campaigning for statutory recognition of the Scots language by the Scottish Parliament. Oor Vyce hopes to achieve a Scots Language Act and the development of a Scots Language Board, which will help to advise the government on Scots issues and ensure that Scots is included in future language policies. The board will also advise on how Scots can be included in the mainstream educational curriculum and will develop a national plan for Scots.:Drew Allan: More Scots words  Gaun yirselWith the establishment of a Scots Language Board, comes more opportunities for those who work within the Scots language sphere, as well as enhanced educational opportunities and funding for organisations and iniduals alike to make Scots more immediately visible in society through artistic, creative, academic, educational and community-based projects. Of course, Scots faces many critics. Online trolls are quick to brand the language ldquoSNP nationalist agenda. When in reality the speaking of Scots is not a political statement and should not be politicised nor bound-up in party politics. Language is not a political stick to beat opponents with ndash it is simply our own ldquomither tongue.A Scots Language Act is about creating meaningful change to ensure that speakers can no longer be stigmatised, and they can feel comfortable in the way they naturally speak and that they can access media and content in their own language. If we have more TV presenters and broadcasters speaking in Scots, and normalising the use of Scots, then perhaps the next generation will feel empowered to use their mother tongue in their professional careers. We can inspire the next generation of authors, writers, presenters, broadcasters, journalists, academics, teachers, singers ndash all working in the medium of our national language. It is also about enabling non-native speakers to access opportunities to learn the language, with correct and developed pedagogy.As I look forward and plan to record my second album of Scots Songs, I can only hope that when the world allows me to tour again, I will be performing my songs in a language that is legally recognised, funded and supported by our Government.

The £ uplt in Universal Credit will continue for another six months, and corporation tax is to rise on profits above £, to  per cent in .Mr Carmichael said: “Today was a #stand still# Budget. There was a lot of hot air and warm words but the Chancellor has clearly put off the hard decisions for later in the year. He is postponing judgement on his intentions but he can only postpone so long.“If and when tax rises come to repair the damage to Government finances, they need to be targeted to those at the top — to big businesses rather than small ones — so that those who are most able will pay their fair share.“I am glad that the Chancellor has, at least, bent to pressure to extend furlough and the Universal Credit uplt, and that the VAT cut for hospitality and tourism will continue for the time being. This is really the least that the Government can be doing to support hard hit businesses which are still waiting for their chance to really recover. What the Chancellor needs to consider – and I shall be raising this point with ministers — is the potential for a long-term cut to tourism VAT. This could be a chance to give solid footing for the sector in building back in the years to come.He added: “News that the support scheme for self-employed people will be expanded to cover some who were previously left out is of course welcome, though we should keep in mind that this leaves millions still falling through the cracks. The Government has had the better part of a year to find ways to support people — there is little excuse left for their inaction.“The Chancellor today has presented a lot of half measures today. You cannot #half support# people in need. Either you want to support people and support recovery fully, or you do not. The Chancellor is again leaving too many people out.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Centralisation remains the most expensive and most economically damaging option and yet HIAL are determined to continue with it.“The proposal of yet another independent study on generating further economic activity falls far short of what is required here. HIAL should immediately pause this project and commission a genuinely independent report considering the feasibility of an alternative localised model,they refuse to do so then the Scottish Government must step in.“This is a major test of the credibility of the Islands Act which was intended to stop projects like this and ensure organisations considered less damaging alternatives. If organisations are allowed to simply ignore these Assessments then the whole Act will be rendered little more than a PR exercise.”On the issue of staffing he added: “The report also confirms Prospect own survey which found that staff in island communities will not relocate to Inverness. HIAL need to explain how they intend to live up to their promise of no compulsory redundancies as all evidence suggests that widespread redundancies now seem inevitable.#While HIAL has claimed that the report proves that an alternative local surveillance solution is #not viable#, Prospect fundamentally disagrees with this assessment.Mr Avery said: “HIAL’s claim that local implementation is not viable or that this report endorses their position is simply not true. This report states HIAL’s position, it very clearly does not endorse it. Any attempt to claim the contrary is just more desperate spin.“Local implementation of air traffic services including surveillance is how air traffic is implemented at almost every airport across the UK including at HIAL’s own Inverness airport. It is a viable workable and resilient alternative but HIAL refuse to consider it.#Meanwhile, HIAL has promised to engage with local authorities across the Highlands and Islands region as it seeks to deliver #viable solutions# to secure the future of leline air services.The company#s managing director Inglis Lyon, said: “We have always known there would be impacts by undertaking such a signicant and complex change management programme.“To date, there have been no alternative proposals that provide a solution that fully addresses all of the challenges HIAL currently faces.”“We hope that everyone with a vested interest in the long-term future of air traffic services in the Highlands and Islands will work us to deliver viable solutions that will maintain leline services and essential connectivity for generations to come.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Many constituents in the isles have written to me to voice their real concerns about the government’s eagerness to arm Saudi Arabia in spite of its persistent human rights violations.#We know thatwe are complicit in the creation of further conflict in the Middle East we are likely to feel echoes of that conflict globally for years to come.”..Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

We then had to anticipate the ageing cycle in dferent cask sizes and types and regularly taste the spirits as they developed, in order to choose which batches would represent us at the relatively youthful ages of our first bottlings.“This process has produced the first of four bottlings which will straddle Torabhaig’s formative years until they have Torabhaig Single Malt Whisky that has aged ten years in barrel that is to be released in .”The very first Torabhaig bottles were auctioned recently, raising £, for two Skye charities.The proceeds go to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig Development Trust and the Friends of Dr Mackinnon Memorial Hospital.Locals will be able to buy a bottle of Torabhaig through the Misty Bottle, Aros, An Crùbh and Armadale Stores – when they open their new shop later this month."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/BALMACARA-HOTEL-1-1.jpg","title":"exciting times ahead for new balmacara","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATUREHotel manager Juan Santos has overseen the refurbishment and the building of an extension in the last year, with the overall aim of improving the hotel’s star rating to four stars.

absolutely right and proper that the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit have extended the consultation period for the Stornoway Wind Farm planning proposal, to afford the Stornoway Community Council more time to make any representations with regard to any objections they might have.All the statutory consultees have been aware of the development and its environmental impact assessment since being notied as far back as the th of May  .The residents of Stornoway were also ‘leafleted’, grazing committees and councillors informed, and everyone was invited to view the public consultation events held in the town hall.Not a single objection was forthcoming.The conclusion that there was “no public interest in holding a public local inquiry” was, correctly, based on this.A hastily cobbled together Facebook poll, quickly seized upon, concluded otherwise.Stornoway’s own community council was only formed after the initial notications were distributed, thereby missing out, initially, on the opportunity to participate.They should be heard.They are highlighting several impacts on the town area.All of these were covered in the report that appeared before the planning application board, indeed all of the negative impacts of such a large-scale development were highlighted in the submissions , but, with the proviso that the comhairle work with the developer, statutory consultees and the Scottish Government’s energy consents unit to best mitigate these ‘impacts’.As vice chairman of sustainable development, and also a member of the planning applications board and the Action for Arnish group, I could not ignore these benefits.A lot does hinge on this particular application.The consultation deadline is March th.When it comes to visual impacts, down here in the ‘Republic’ of Point we have been subjected to the sight of no fewer than  turbines as we drive towards ‘Gotham’, for the best part of five years.Only three are of any meaningful benefit to our economy and they belong to us.Does this, to a degree, make them easier on the eye EDFhas long been subjected to a well-orchestrated campaign of opposition.The reasons are myriad, historical and complex.That the comhairle, the Stornoway Trust and most other local landowners failed to capitalise on the potential bounty on our own doorstep in the early s is hardly their fault.Blame previous administrations,you must.Yet for having the temerity to be foreign, have a confirmed lease, have a business plan, a grid connection offer and the finance to capitalise on the potential that we so obviously missed out on EDF have been hugely vilied at almost every turn.Of course it would be betterthe island was reaping all of these financial rewards for the complete benefit to the local community economy , but several factors must be taken into consideration.Should the comhairle be looking to build turbines now The dficulty arises with the ability to fund a project on which the comhairle has absolutely no sighting on the energy price which can be realised at the forthcoming Contract for Dference auction.The council needs to be looking to maximise the potential which can be gleaned from the renewables ‘regime’, while minimising its exposure to risk, unplanned spending, or speculation.The time for building turbines, or investigating the possibility of building turbines, was to  years ago and the opportunity was missed.Circumstances change and I’m sure that those trusted with the policy decisions of the comhairle, armed with all the facts they had at their disposal then, made what they considered the correct choice.The council’s current energy strategy is to attempt to generate income for the people of these islands who do not directly benefit from the current crop of excellent schemes, as listed above.The joint venture between the comhairle and the trust seeks to maximise, with no risk to either body, the potential income from their stake in Stornoway and Uisenis wind farms.That being said, the ‘playing field’ has changed signicantly and the days of ‘wine and roses’, currently enjoyed by those fortunate enough to have had the foresight to build historically, will not, in any way shape or form, be comparable to any future, post CfD, landscape.It would be dficult to go to the bank, ask for a loan to buy an ice cream van, without any idea what the market price for ice cream was.So why is the success of Stornoway Wind Farm so crucial The issue of windfarm development in Lewis is a challenging and complex one that requires negative impacts to be weighed up against signicant benefits. It is always a balanced decision that requires a host of issues to be taken into consideration.Here are a few things to consider for those asked to respond to Stornoway Community Council’s consultation.The island grid, supplied by a shaky distribution link from Fort Augustus through Skye, is full to capacity and closed to new connections – it has been for years.SSEN have decided to replace the failed Skye to Harris cable with a like-for-like kV cable.The new kV cable will offer  per cent more export capacity, enough to provide firm connections for our existing community generators .SSEN will not build a second kV cable without solid demand for it, in terms of prospective wind farms with approved planning permission and solid grid connection contracts.This effectively means that the only way to achieve additional capacity for the islands is to back the planned MW transmission link with its MW of ‘headroom’ for future projects.Only the commercial wind farms, Stornoway Wind Farm, Uisenis Wind Farm and Druim Leathann Wind Farm , have the financial wherewithal to underwrite the planned transmission link .Ofgem will authorise the transmission link onlyStornoway Wind Farm goes ahead.• Any attempt to derail Stornoway Wind Farm is an attempt to derail the £ million deep water terminal, since it is premised on a renewables and a hydrogen economy.With no transmission link, no commercial wind farms, no community wind farms, no low cost electricity, continued dependence on imported fossil fuels, an undermined deep water terminal, an undermined Arnish fabrication yard and a hydrogen economy set back by ten years what is the alternative I love my wild and unspoilt vistas, my beaches and my hills as much as the next islander.I’d love the notion of population growth and sustainability, based on gin, tweed, tourism, crofting and salmon farming to be a reality but it isn’t.There needs to be, and I’ve said this before, a ‘mix’ of the strands that make up the fabric of our island#s economy.And we need to add another strand to move in anyway the right direction to reverse the current trend.There are several sides to every argument.We count the peatland, the visual impact and the hen harriers on the one hand and all the rest, outlined above, on the other.We take everything on board and hope that we are making the right choices for the benefit of more than just Stornoway.If there are any better alternatives, they’ve managed to remain hidden from view for far too long."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ARMADALE-STORES-OPEN-1-scaled.jpg","title":"new shop opens its doors in south","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWhen the old shop, post office and petrol station closed in , the Sleat Community Trading board, management and staff expected to be operating out of their temporary container in Ardvasar for six months.Covid caused understandable delays, but eighteen months later the staff have now left their cold and draughty temporary shop behind.Shop and post office manager Mhairi Cousins said: “I can’t praise the staff, board and volunteers highly enough.

Wilfred J.A. Armstrong, BA, took place last Tuesday .Rev. Armstrong sadly passed away on Sunday, February .Second Broughshane Presbyterian Church Minister, Rev. Alastair Beattie conduced the funeral service, with all current restrictions adhered to. In a tribute Rev. Beattie outlined that Rev. Armstrong was born in Londonderry on February , . He was the son of William and Margaret Armstrong. William had a grocery business in the city and Wilfred grew up helping with the family business. The family were members of Great James Street congregation in Londonderry and Wilfred was educated at Foyle College. After school Wilfred studied at Magee University which was then affiliated to the Presbyterian Church. He graduated from Trinity College Dublin, moving to New College Edinburgh, and finalising his ministerial studies at Assembly’s College Belfast. Licensed by the Derry Presbytery in , assisted Rev Borland at Hamilton Road congregation in Bangor while still a student, then served an assistantship in Richmond Craigmillar Church of Scotland. In June  Rev Armstrong was ordained to the ministry and installed minister of Aughnacloy and Ballymagrane congregations in Co Tyrone. He arrived a bachelor boy, but met a girl from Lisnaskea in the county of Fermanagh, called Valerie Graham, and was married in March . After  years in Tyrone Wilfred received a call to be Minister of Second Broughshane Congregation in Ballymena Presbytery. He accepted that call and was installed on September , . He was a valued member of Presbytery, Synod and General Assembly fulfilling all duties required of him. Mr Armstrong was a devoted and faithful Minister. Preaching faithfully from God’s word he was an encouragement to many, and the means used by God to draw others to faith in Jesus Christ. In an era when Missions and Youth Coffee Bar were popular, Mr Armstrong was encouraged to see the congregation grow numerically but especially spiritually. He had a pastoral heart, caring dutully for all the people.He was especially particular about names, and recorded names in his memory, to recall in the future. His pastoral care endeared him to the sick and sorrowing of the congregation and his helpfulness to all was appreciated. During Mr Armstrong’s Ministry, the congregation carried out an extension to the church hall and extended the centre aisle entrance porch to incorporate a Choir Room on the ground floor and a Session Room above. A lover of historical facts and figures Mr Armstrong kept careful written and pictorial records of these projects and of other signicant in the le of the congregation. “I am told by Valerie that he had kept a diary since the age of , quite a compilation of daily facts,” said Rev. Beattie. In his Ministry Wilfred was ably assisted and encouraged by his loving we Valerie, who was known to borrow items from local shops for her husband’s children’s talks. “There was no use of PowerPoint then nor access to the internet and Google. They traveled together to dferent world destinations, including manse and pulpit exchanges on a number of occasions,” continued Rev. Beattie.In , after  years of Ministry in Broughshane, Rev Armstrong retired from active ministry and he and Valerie moved to live in Ballymena at Brigadie and settled into the Ballymena congregation of Wellington. “Retired, but not finished, as together Wilfred and Valerie filled engagements at ious meetings sharing their ‘Le Story’. This included coming to our own Sunshine Hour. Mr Armstrong also assisted the Ministry at Ballee for a time as well as many preaching engagements while able,” outlined Rev. Beattie. “The past few years have been marked by health issues that caused Wilfred to be in hospital on several occasions. Responding to treatment he wouldhome to the tender care of Valerie. With declining health Wilfred was finally called to his heavenly home early on Sunday morning .”Rev. Beattie continued -“As one who was faithful in ministry and in le, he has now entered the ‘joy of the Lord’. With the words of Paul to Timothy he could say, “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3676503.jpg--.jpg?1614945757000\n","title":"major new factory extension for ballymena based firm","story":"Mid and East Antrim firm Apeer Doors have much to celebrate after successfully completing their new ,ft factory extension.Despite the huge challenges of Covid-, the Ballymena-based door company also managed to increase its workforce through the creation of  additional jobs in .Apeer Doors seen an increase in the demand for their composite doors with people using the time indoors during lockdown to upgrade their homes, and with the projection of more homes being built across the UK, the demand for their product is expected to remain high.Production Director of Apeer Doors, Chris Wilson said: “We started the year strongly, but like many others we were forced to close for a period due to lockdown. “We worked hard during this period to ensure the factory was as safe as possible for our workforce when we re-opened in May, and since then we have seen increased demand for our Apeer Composite Doors.“This enabled us to hire additional personnel and we are determined to continue to grow the business through  and beyond.”The Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force , Graham Whitehurst MBE said: “Apeer Doors are now one of the largest employers in the Ballymena area and a key member of the MTF.“I was delighted to hear about their success in  and that they have been able to provide employment for  people. “I very much look forward to continuing to support the growth of one of our key local manufacturing companies. “The MTF and Council’s Economic Development Team will continue to work closely with Chris and the team at Apeer to provide any support we can to aid business growth and development.”Through continued investment in digital marketing to help build upon the Apeer door and Lumi window brands, the company hopes to continue to grow throughout .Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Manufacturing Task Force was set up in  to mitigate the impact of the closures of leading local employers and provide a robust  for inward investment, increased employment opportunities and economic development.

Pat Cullen, director of the RCN in Northern Ireland, described the proposed pay hike as “insulting” and said health bosses were “dangerously out of touch” with nurses and public opinion. It emerged on Thursday that England’s Department of Health wanted to award nurses a mere % pay rise because of the financial impact of the pandemic. The figure was contained in a submission to the NHS Pay Review Body, which advises on the wages of health service staff. Health Minister Robin Swann previously said he must award the same rise to local nurses. The Belfastasked Mr Swannhe agreed with the increase andhe would be willing to break with pay parity. A spokeswoman from the Department of Health said: “Any decision on a pay award for Northern Ireland workers will be taken after the pay review bodies make their recommendations. We do not intend to pre-empt those recommendations. “Our pay award decisions can only be taken in the context of a wider public sector pay policy set by the Department of Finance.” But Ms Cullen said: “Nursing staff will be feeling insulted by the suggestion that they are only worth a % pay rise. “It is clearis dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, other health care workers and the public. “While the Pay Review Body will make its own recommendation, our members have already been voicing their outrage. “The RCN has been clear that this year, of all years, we need a signicant and fair pay rise. “An additional £. a week for an experienced nurse is by no means fair and will do nothing to prevent an exodus from the profession. It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff. “Our members will not shy away from voicing their concerns. As a result of this announcement, the RCN Council convened an emergency meeting, voting unanimously and immediately to set up a £m industrial action fund.” Strike funds are used to provide compensation for workers during industrial action. The RCN said it was determined to have the finances available to members should they wish to take action. Covid- hit Northern Ireland weeks after healthcare workers suspended strike action over pay and dangerous staffing levels. Local NHS employees have been growing increasingly frustrated in recent months over what is seen as a failure by Stormont to act on their concerns. It emerged last week that legislation to address dangerous nursing levels would not be passed by the current Assembly. Stormont made a deal with healthcare workers last January that it would implement safe staffing laws to bring about a pause in industrial action. However, the chief nursing officer said there was now not enough time for the law to be passed.This came after healthcare workers waited almost nine months for the Department of Health topay docked from wages during strike action.Belfast Most ReadEx-DUP mayor Thomas Hogg convicted of trying to get underage boy to engage in sexual activityExecutive hopes to see last phase of lockdown by June : Michelle O#NeillOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesWhy you  DUP MP Carla Lockhart pulled up on her Commons languageTop VideosVideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoHealth correspondent Lisa Smyth reviews the executive#s roadmap out of lockdownVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandCase against RHI cuts put on holdElderly woman confronted by masked intruder during Belfast burglary Three PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry DUP#s Storey slams Sinn Fein asinhumane, ill-mannered and downright ignorantOrder forcing Newry gym to close its doors revokedLatest from Belfast Taoiseach – Other countries will use vaccine supplies themselvesTeam of  used ‘dogged determination’ to find mystery infected inidualMeghan’s friends rally to her defence after bullying allegationsOtter with fishing line round its middle rescuedCase against RHI cuts put on hold,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While there has been no runway extension, the airline said it could work around the issue.Its push to sell flights could put it at odds with Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, who said last week she would not encourage people to go on holiday. Dara Brady, Ryanair#s marketing director, said the speed of vaccinations suggested holidays would be safe from June.He confirmed the airline was not in favour of requiring vaccination passports, although most countries do require a negative Covid test to enter. Mr Brady added: The Government#s highly successful rollout of the vaccination programme gives customers the confidence that travel will be possible this summer, and Northern Ireland consumers now have eight routes at low fares to some of the most popular summer holiday destinations in Spain, Portugal and Italy to choose from.Brian Ambrose, chief executive of Belfast City Airport, said: This is excellent news for those in Northern Ireland considering a getaway this summer.A spokesman for the International Airport added: We are pleased that Ryanair will continue to operate its existing services from Belfast International.It is a year since Belfast City Airport found itself counting the cost of the collapse of Flybe, its biggest customer.Belfast Most ReadEx-DUP mayor Thomas Hogg convicted of trying to get underage boy to engage in sexual activityExecutive hopes to see last phase of lockdown by June : Michelle O#NeillOutlook#s bright as Louise Small becomes new face of UTV weatherWhy you  DUP MP Carla Lockhart pulled up on her Commons languageMichaela Foundation to close, John McAreavey announcesTop VideosVideoCarla Lockhart apologises for inappropriate language in ParliamentVideoHealth correspondent Lisa Smyth reviews the executive#s roadmap out of lockdownVideoMajor police operation as Holyland parties continue into a second nightLatest Northern IrelandCase against RHI cuts put on holdElderly woman confronted by masked intruder during Belfast burglary Three PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry DUP#s Storey slams Sinn Fein asinhumane, ill-mannered and downright ignorantOrder forcing Newry gym to close its doors revokedLatest from Belfast Case against RHI cuts put on holdWelsh Government have ‘not tried to set a ceiling’ on NHS pay rise, Gething saysIn-form Viktor Hovland impresses again on day two of Arnold Palmer InvitationalElderly woman confronted by masked intruder during Belfast burglary Three PSNI officers injured after police car rammed by lorry ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

dogged determination to find mystery","story":" FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBy Tom Pilgrim, PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA team of  people, armed with just a single bar code and limited test data, spent days using “dogged determination” to track down the mystery person infected with the Manaus coronavirus iant.Data analytic experts and laboratory and logistic resources were drafted in to help identy the inidual who tested positive for the iant of concern, with the team narrowing in on them among thousands of potential households.Three cases of the P iant, first identied in the Brazilian city of Manaus, were detected in England on February .A public appeal was launched for one of those people to come forward after they left no contact details.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on Friday, Public Health England’s Dr Susan Hopkins detailed how they were successfully found.She explained that the unnamed person, who lives in Croydon, south London, had attempted to register his test online, but “had failed to do so effectively”.Dr Hopkins continued: “Specialist teams from NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England immediately launched an investigation to identy the inidual concerned.“An incident team of  people from across the system made up of laboratories, logistics, data analytic experts was mobilised to trace the inidual.“The team began with very little information.”She said, on Sunday morning, they were only in possession of a single barcode and the date and time that the test was processed at the Cambridge Lighthouse laboratory.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ef .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-de-f-aafa-cecaaa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ef .ece AUTOCROP w

Hopkins PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHealthcare Epidemiologist Consultant Susan Hopkins The discovery, via reading the test barcode, that the sample had arrived at the Cambridge Lighthouse through the DHL service for home delivery helped narrow it down to two regions made up of , possible households.Even though NHS Test and Trace delivers “many thousands” of kits a week, the team were able to compare the test in question to others in the system and work “backwards” from when it arrived in the laboratory, to which testing hub it had come from and through the postal service.Their intelligence was then “overlaid with the geographical spread to look for the correlation of sequential barcodes”, Dr Hopkins said.Once the region and “time window” for the test were combined, experts tracked down “every single” distribution centre to filter down options.These were narrowed to  households with “enhanced contact tracing” then kicking-in, with call handlers phoning and emailing those who could have received a test in that time interval.This scaled it down to  iniduals who received further calls and text messages.Dr Hopkins said: “On Wednesday at pm, an inidual phoned the  service.“They were able to give the missing barcode number that they had held securely for the whole time.“This inidual has been interviewed extensively and lives within a household that had recently ed from Brazil and all had quarantined at home.“Further precautionary testing will occur in the neighbourhood and we have already started testing all of the samples from the neighbourhood through whole genome sequencing to ensure there is no further distribution of cases in the community.”She added: “This is a testament to the NHS Test and Trace teams, the call handlers and the Public Health England health protection team working together to find an inidual and prevent further transmission.”Health secretary Matt Hancock also hailed the “brilliant” team who had been “working so hard over the past week”.He said: “Using the latest technology and with the dogged determination of our Testing and Tracing scheme, we have successfully identied the person in question.“The best evidence is that this person in question stayed at home and there is no sign that there’s been any onward transmission but as a precaution we are putting more testing in in Croydon where they live to minimise the risk of spread.”PAMost ReadEx-DUP mayor Thomas Hogg convicted of trying to get underage boy to engage in sexual activityExecutive hopes to see last phase of lockdown by

The Duddy Group has a portfolio of hotel and property investments in Derry and Dublin. He said: “Last year when they had a phased opening of hotels and restaurants opened it had no impact on infections. “Sothings keep improving I would like to be open by the end of April or start of May – that’s what I’m hoping for.” googletag.cmd.push The NI Executivehas agreed a five-step planfor easing the Covid- lockdown restrictions. In contrast to plans announced in Britain, NIs ‘pathway’ does not include a timetable. Progression through each of the nine pathways will depend on public health criteria being met. The Executive will review its restrictions each month starting on March  and continuing to June . However, the plan does not include specic detail on what will guide the easements such as the rate of transmission or hospital numbers. Step one represents the current lockdown restrictions, with steps two to four allowing an easing of the rules and the final step entitled preparing for the future. googletag.cmd.push ‘DATA-DRIVEN’ Mr Duddy wants more guidance for businesses because financial obligations are growing by the day. As a hotel and property owner he said a ‘running time’ is needed so that people can organise their accommodation. He commented: “What can you do, it doesn’t give you any clarity, it gives you no clarity as a customer. “I suppose the hope is from our point of view, the sensible thing is to wait and see how the vaccine goes. “It doesn’t help us in a business sense, and whether or not I agree with them, they have to see how things pan out.     “But they’re going to have to open and they’re going to have to open probably sooner than we think.” He added: “I think there is going to be pressure from ious elements of business. “The Executive can only react as information emerges but you’d like to hope there would be some structure to it.” “It’s extraordinarily dficult to plan,” he explained. “There are banks to deal with, staff, suppliers, rent and insurance to pay and lt and fire maintenance. All bills that are coming up.” He expects to see extra details emerging in the coming days given that the pathway is supposed to be ‘data led’. Meanwhile, another local businessman, Eamon Gee, who owns and works in the Gee’s shop on Rossdowney Road said it has been ‘dficult’ trading throughout the pandemic. However, his business has experienced a bit of an uplt because people are eating in with restaurants closed. Mr Gee said government Ministers are in an unenviable position at present as they try to strike a balance between public health and the economy. “In all honesty I wouldn’t want to be in their position. They are never going to be able to please everybody, they are dealing with people’s lives and livelihoods. “Trying to balance the two is incredible dficult and I have a degree of sympathy for them. “They definitely could have done some things better, they’ve handled other things very well.” He continued: “The pathway isn’t clear, a lot of people were expecting dates, but realistically I don’t they can put dates on it. “However, I do think they could have given some factual information. “They said it’ll be very much data driven so they could have given an indication of where they want the rate of transmission or hospital admissions to be at each stage.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry woman Martina Keating passed away in  after battling with cancer. Along with others, the Keating family will be remembering a very special lady who is absent on March . They are holding a fundraiser for a local charity that has touched the lives of many people in the city. Donators will also be entered into a draw to win a gt set that can be presented to a mother, granny, aunty, sister, friend or any special lady. Martina’s husband Michael, daughters Natasha and Elisha, and sons Nathan and Jack are still coming to terms with the loss but hold on to many happy memories. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News, Natasha paid tribute to her mother saying: “Anyone who knew my mammy knew that she was somebody you could always go to for advice. “She always had a smile on her face and was carrying on. Mammy was just known by everybody and when she smiled she lit up the room.” In June  Martina was helping Elisha gather belongings to move to university when she experienced pain. At first she suspected it was a pulled muscle and went to the hospital. After performing gall bladder surgery doctors diagnosed cancer in her liver and bowel. “It came as a big shock to us all. My mum battled for six months and died at the age of ,” Natasha said. googletag.cmd.push Foyle Hospice supported the family, allowing them to comfort Martina until the end. In particular, one special nurse called Rose Green went above and beyond. Now retired, Rose worked as part of the Community Specialist Palliative Care Team at the Hospice. It is a group of specially trained nurses who provide professional palliative care expertise and support to patients and their families in their own home. Natasha recalled: “Rose arranged everything, we didn’t have to do anything when it came to getting a hospital bed or making sure that my mum was comfortable. “She ended up doubling up as a counsellor for us, she was amazing.     “So we always wanted to give back. “We know that the pandemic has impacted on all local charities and we’d like to help them all. “But we wanted to do it in memory of my mammy for Mother’s Day so that’s why we chose somewhere that did help us, in the hope it can help another family like us.” Martina’s death was the first time that the family was directly affected by cancer. Sadly, her family has experienced untold heartbreak in the past. Natasha said: “My daddy lost his mother to a brain haemorrhage in August , lost his two sisters in a house fire not far from the flower shop he owns in Beechwood and lost his father in a car crash. “It’s a lot of tragedy for one person to go through.” Martina’s death left a chasm in all their lives. “My mum had us spoilt rotten so we had to learn everything, we’ve had the support of family and friends who have been so good. “As a family we are really close and help each other so much. “Even though it has been seven years it’s still quite raw, I don’t think it’s something you can ever get over.” Having witnessed the dedication of hospital staff during her mother’s illness, Elisha trained to be a nurse and is now working on the ward where Martina was treated. As a family they wanted to do something more to recognise the hard work of the Foyle Hospice and Mother’s Day this year provided the perfect opportunity. The prize which will be given away is worth over pound with items including a Michael Kors bag, nomination bracelet, perfume set, rainbow flowers bouquet and beauty hamper. To be in with a chance of winning all you have to do is make a minimum donation of pound. The plan is for the competition to close and winner to be chosen on Mother’s Day.

The team will work in partnership with victims and survivors of Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry Institutions to establish the terms of reference for a fully independent investigation. In recent months the Derry News has highlighted the personal experiences of local people who either stayed at the Good Shepherd Home and Laundry in the city or had a mother who lived there. The  of experts announced today to lead an investigation includes local woman,Deirdre Mahon, who isDirector of Women and Children’s Services and the Executive Director of Social Work in the Western Health and Social Services Trust. googletag.cmd.push She is a qualied and experienced Social Worker Youth and Community worker and is passionate about ensuring that the voices of service users are heard, understood and are central to the development and delivery of services. Throughout her  year career, Deirdre has had extensive experience in both direct work with service users, and the management and development of staff. She has been a driving force in the roll-out of trauma informed practice across Northern Ireland. The other experts are, Phil Scraton, a Professor Emeritus in the School of Law,Queens University Belfast. He has an international reputation for research into the rights of bereaved families and survivors, particularly his investigative work into the Hillsborough disaster. googletag.cmd.push And Dr Maeve O’Rourke who is Lecturer in Human Rights at the Irish Centre for Human Rights, National University of Ireland Galway, and a barrister at  Bedford Row, London. She has worked pro bono for more than a decade with iniduals and relatives of those affected by Magdalene Laundries, Mother and Baby Institutions, forced and illegal adoptions, and related institutions and practices in the Republic of Ireland. The appointments follow a statement by the Northern Ireland Executive in January of its intention to establish a victim-centred independent investigation into the operation of the historical institutions between  and  – the date the last institution in Northern Ireland closed its doors.     The Executive also decided that the investigation would be designed jointly with victims and survivors over a period of six months. The Department of Health has also revealed details of a dedicated phone line    and website to enable victims and survivors of the institutions to participate. Anyone with a connection with the institutions can become involved. Information of how to take part is available on theNI Direct website. Information on a range of supports available can also be accessed on the website. Speaking about the appointments, the Health Minister Robin Swann said: “Iam delighted to announce the appointment of Deirdre Mahon, Professor Phil Scraton and Dr. Maeve O’Rourke to work with victims and survivors to establish the terms of reference for an independent investigation into Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry institutions in Northern Ireland. I have asked the team to start its work immediately and to report within the six month timeframe set by the Executive for this work.” SHAMEFUL PERIOD First Minister Arlene Foster spoke of the many women and children who were victims of shocking ill-treatment and abuse in Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalene Laundries who have had to wait far too long for their voices to be heard. The appointment of this team of experts to work with victims and survivors in shaping the independent investigation is another welcome step forward in the long fight to break the silence around their suffering. “All three iniduals bring a wealth of experience and expertise in this area and I am confident that, through a process of engagement and working side by side with victims and survivors, the team will be able to shape an investigation that will have their confidence and deliver the truth and justice they deserve,” she added. Meanwhile, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said:“The harrowing stories of the many women and children who suffered abuse in Mother and Baby Homes and Magdalene Laundries are truly heartbreaking. They were treated appallingly by these institutions and failed on every level. “This is another signicant step towards finally securing justice for the victims and survivors of this abuse, and it is vital that they are at the heart of the co-design process. “I would encourage all victims and survivors to come forward and to make their voices heard so that the team of experts can set about shining a light on this dark and shameful period in our history.” Judith Gillespie, the independent chair of the inter-departmental working group, which had oversight of research by Queen’s University and Ulster University into the historical institutions and made recommendations to the Northern Ireland Executive based on that research, also welcomed the appointments. She concluded: “This is another important step for victims and survivors of Mother and Baby and Magdalene Laundry institutions. For too long their voices have not been heard and the co-design process will be fundamental to addressing that.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Next week the local Trust will mark  months since the first pandemic patient was admitted to the South West Acute Hospital. Over  patients have died in Altnagelvin Hospital and South West Acute Hospital since who had a Covid- diagnosis. That has taken a ‘huge’ toll on families and staff who were with patients in their final moments, a Western Trust Board meeting was told. Chief Executive Dr Anne Kilgallen said that in the midst of the dreadful challenges and trauma experienced, iniduals and teams have grown and developed at pace. googletag.cmd.push Leaders have emerged at every level, and continue to do so, and Director of Human Resources Ann McConnell has played a big part in ‘sowing the seeds for this collective leadership’ well before pandemic, she added. The meeting heard that there are , people who work for the Western Trust and service teams now that did not exist  months ago. The Trust’s Covid Vaccination Teams continue to achieve ‘extraordinary levels of vaccine delivery’, by mobile teams in care homes, supported living facilities and day centres as well as in its three Mass Vaccination Centres. To date, the teams have delivered over , vaccinations. googletag.cmd.push All Care Homes in the WHSCT area have had second doses delivered to original residents who were fit to have the vaccine. In Supported Living facilities, the second dose programme is at an advanced stage. The mobile vaccination teams have also delivered vaccines to users of Learning Disability Day Centres and Day Opportunities as well as to long stay mental health inpatients and plan to deliver to the homeless population in the coming weeks. Dr Kilgallen said: “To successfully organise and deliver a public health programme of this scale and magnitude against a backdrop of uncertainties about supply, personnel and scope reflects the ingenuity, flexibility and problem-solving ability of a erse team nurtured under Ann’s leadership.     “We have relied on the expertise of Ann and of her team, their technical expertise and their strong relationships with our Staff Side colleagues to help us navigate and support our staff. “Those relationships have enabled us to respond to unprecedented challenges, always putting the care and support of our patients and service users at the forefront. “Ann leaves a team and corporate service of which she can be hugely proud. No one person could have achieved what we have achieved in the last  months yet no one person can have been more central than Ann. Those of us who have worked with her know this.” PROUD Trust Chair Sam Pollock echoed those sentiments saying: “You’ve stayed calm and cool. Your performance has just been superb, your support, your insight and way of managing people, bringing out the best in them is just awesome. “Thank you Ann for everything you’ve done. “The administration of the vaccine in Foyle Arena and other centres has been huge. I’ve had loads of compliments passed on to the Trust. “I’m proud of the Trust and the way we’ve administered the vaccine. “We’re way ahead of other Trusts, who’ve struggled, it’s down to your foresight and ability to manage and I want to acknowledged that publicly and wish you well in your retirement, you deserve it.” Speaking at her last Board meeting, Ann McConnell said it was a privilege to be part of the Trust Board having started out as a clerical officer. “It’s something I’ve never taken for granted. I’ve been really fortunate with the teams that I’ve had around me and the people supporting me,” she said. “They all inspire me to do my best and that’s what I’ve done, I will leave the organisation knowing that I’ve done my best in all of the circumstances. “I’m very proud of the vaccination programme even though it caused me many sleepless nights and more hours of my le than any job ever should. “Getting it off the ground in the West was a really challenge because we didn’t have many people on the register wanting to be vaccinators.” She continued: “But actually that programme has been one of the things I’ve been privileged to be part of because there aren’t many HR people who’ve run a service and now I feel like I have which has made a dference to patient’s lives. “I want to thank you all very much, I have been stretched, challenged, and supported lots and I thank you all for that. “I know you will be doing really important work rebuilding services for our population and there isn’t a more important job in the Western area so I wish you all the luck in the world.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Those closest to him insist that the renowned orator will again be on the streets of Derry with is trademark megaphone in hand. Earlier this week, the Derry man announced that he will be resigning from his role as a councillor on health grounds. He was diagnosed with epilepsy about  years ago but it had not hindered his work. However, it was discovered during tests some months ago that he had developed a neurological condition, Ataxia. googletag.cmd.push “This has made it increasingly dficult for me to fulfill my duty as a councillor in the way the people of the Moor DEA are entitled to expect,” he said. Social media was awash with goodwill messages and people sharing fond memories of the tenacious socialist. His partner, Goretti Horgan, thanked the well-wishers but emphasised that he still has ‘a couple of books in him yet’ and ‘will continue to be an active socialist’. “Eamonn isn’t sick but has mobility issues that make being a good elected rep dficult, hence the resignation,” she explained. Those sentiments were echoed by his friend and party colleague on Derry City  Strabane District Council, Shaun Harkin. googletag.cmd.push He commented: “Every tribute Eamonn has received is more than well deserved and hell be very much missed at Council. “However, anyone under the impression Eamonn is retiring will be sorely disappointed. “Ive no doubt Eamonn will, and look forward to seeing, Eamonn continuing to be a thorn in the side of the political establishment and an inspiring champion for justice, civil rights for all and socialism. Onwards Eamonn!” One of the founding members of the Civil Rights campaign, Eamonn is also an accomplished writer, journalist and trade unionist who has been involved in politics for more than  years. Speaking to the Derry News previously McCann believed in the need for ‘radical’ policies in government to ensure that Derry gets its fair share.     “Why are we still so far behind in terms of university education, infrastructure, of living standards, relative rates of poverty – why is Derry still lagging behind after nationalists took control of it  “Both orange and green have had their time, half a century each at running Derry, surely it’s time to try something that might work. “Public money is being frittered away in dodgy schemes which are semi-criminal enterprises. “There’s an awful lot that can be done and I believe in a radical programme for the future which I don’t think any other party has,” he said. McCann will make way for someone  to fill his shoes in council but will remain on the streets as a champion of the civil rights, a defender of the oppressed and an opponent of capitalism which he describes as ‘the never-ending source of all our political ills’.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The few weeks turned into years and Maggie lived with Bridie for almost  years before moving into Owen Mor care home in Culmore two years ago, where she has been very happy. Maggies grand-niece, Cornelia Duffy-Teymur, said what you see what is what you get with Maggie. “Auntie Maggie is loved by everyone who knows her and is renowned for her very straight talking opinion. Don’t ever ask hershe likes something you’re wearing - you’ll end up having to change,” said Cornelia. googletag.cmd.push “Having lived through historical le transformations and world events - she was normally the centre of attention during story-telling in Bridie’s at night. “Maggie never married, never had children of her own but did a magnicent job looking after her niece and nephews and indeed her great nieces and great nephew. “It was natural to her to give and care for others and this then automatically transits to her great great nieces and nephews too. “As far as aunties go - we think she’s definitely ahead of any game. Her influence, time and her constantly giving us money allowed us the privilege to enjoy le so much.”     Cornelia said that Maggies treats included bingo, brandy balls and a wee snuff now and again. And she was a huge fan of a certain TV show. “Dare you talk when she watched Home  Away, even though one of the two showings a day was a repeat,” she said. “The Sound of Music, The Quiet Man and White Christmas were her go-to movies and she loves a laugh. “We are so honoured and proud to call her our auntie. Her love and care to our mammy Bridie and to us - her children - made us the most fortunate family ever. “The world definitely needs more Auntie Maggies. We are so grateful she got to be ours,” said Cornelia.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For owner Ciara McKenna, lockdown has had a relatively positive effect. “A lot of shops and places arent open, but its been really busy,” she said. “Maybe with cafes not being open, and Kilrea having Portna and Hutchinsons Quay, people can grab something and go for a walk.”     Ciara began baking during the first lockdown almost a year ago, and as her confidence grew, so did her ambition. “Id been doing afternoon tea boxes, and then I got this idea that I wanted to convert a horse box into a wee coffee hut,” she said. “My partner did all the work himself and converted it. We got it off a man in Knockloughrim as a plain horse box and its unreal the way its turned out. “We opened up on the worst weekend, because it was really windy and rainy, and then on the Saturday the snow came. “The snow was heavy, but I couldnt believe how busy we were with how bad the weather was. Every time you look there is a queue. “When you open youd be worriedanyone was going to show, oryouve baked enough, but every weekend Ive had to bake more. “I keep telling myself, because I can move about, thatits not doing well, we can go somewhere , but I hope it wont come to that. “I thinkour stuff is good enough, well still get our customers.” An old-style phone box at the top of the Drumagarner Road. Kilrea has two, with the other at the Diamond. Things are starting to pick up as I head back down through the Diamond and onto Bridge Street. Chatter drts through the open door of McAtamneys as I make my way past. The late John Dallats constituency office sits empty, its signage stripped from above the door. What a dference a year makes. Gym equipment sits in partial shadow in the unit next to the car wash. On down the hill the lights on the school sign continue to flash a warning to motorists. The Bann glistens in the distance, still swollen from the recent rain as it meanders its way around the old Portneal Lodge site. After closing its doors in , the building has been dormant since, with just the picturesque walk around its perimeter left to attract people there. The appearance of a branded pick-up truck at its entrance, and the flashy new sign, however, point to renewed le at the site. Inside the gate sits yet another recent addition to the towns business landscape. Stranded is a burger van with a dference, as owners Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney explain. “Its been a bit mad, we thought wed be serving  burgers a night and weve been way busier than we thought wed ever be,” said Adrian. “I dont knowits just because of lockdown, but its good anyway. Were offering something dferent that no one  does round here.” Adrian Doherty and Ailish Deeney launched Stranded Burger three weeks ago. Adrians partner, Ailish, says local reaction to their opening has been hugely positive. “I think the local residents are very happy to see the site being used as well. Its been lying abandoned and people have been abusing it,” she said. “With the bridge, we thought it would be a good place for people passing, and its a nice location beside the river as well, its scenic. “Its something wed always considered, coming from a catering background and being foodie-lovers. Weve always talked about a burger van and this year we took the plunge. “Its been extremely busy, weve got a mad response that we just couldnt believe at all. People are queuing and travelling to come here, so we couldnt have asked for a better response.” The pair, like any other lockdown era entrepreneurs, have had their doubts, but they have planned well ahead, with both their business model and their branding. “It happened so fast we didnt really have time to think about it. We had to get the van done up and we were still doing that on opening week, so it was a whole rush to get everything sorted,” said Ailish. “The name Stranded works well, because we could be stranded anywhere. At the minute its Portneal Lodge, butsomewhere came up where there was demand, we could be stranded there. “As far as competition goes, there is room for everybody and we want everybody to do well, because were all in the same game at the end of the day.” On the way back to the car, I pause at the Diamond, taking a seat outside Mullins. The weather has brought people onto the streets and, as it often does, has them in good spirits. A man makes his way briskly towards Coleraine Street, his dog on a lead in front of him. A woman jogs up the hill as he heads down.  Conversation floats across the street from where three men have stopped outside the bookmakers. Its clear they havent seen each other in a while. Theyre uneasy, maintaining the required distance, but you get the feeling theyd be happy to take a seat and spend the afternoon just watching the traffic go back and forth. The conversation ends. They head off in separate directions, one down Bridge Street, one down Coleraine Street and the other across the Diamond towards Church Street. Late February. Sunshine. Old friends meeting in the streets. A community yearning for normality. As the daily update brings news of mounting vaccine numbers and falling case numbers, you can almost touch the hope. Or maybe thats just the good weather talking.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Liam McElhinney and Paul McFlynn are both in agreement regarding a , but insist any guidelines must be adhered to. Last month a letter, signed by  people from a range of sporting backgrounds across Ulster, was sent to the Office of the First Minister and Deputy Minister . It outlined the frustration in their communities and clubs about the neglect of youth sport. “We believe the curtailing of outdoor youth sport is now unnecessary and not supported by either science or best practice,” the letter read. The letter, which asked for immediate action be taken to mandate aof sport in covid safe environments, was only acknowledged yesterday, over two weeks later. googletag.cmd.push A response has been promised, but there seems to be some discrepancy whose remit it comes under. Former Derry and Loup player Paul McFlynn, the Course Director of the Postgraduate PE teaching course at Ulster University, was one of the signatures on the letter. Dr John McSparran, a former Antrim GAA Chairman, and Dr Martin McConaghy – a Sports Medicine Doctor – also put their support behind the letter. “The people who wrote the letter werent doing this for selfish reasons or they werent undermining the risk,” McFlynn told the County Derry Post. Former Derry player Paul McFlynn  googletag.cmd.push “When you look at the detrimental impact not having children involved in exercise and physical activity is having on them, thisis something you should surely be able to do.” McFlynn said those behind the letter had their homework done and had read an article from Marie Murphy, a Professor in Exercise and Health “She was alluding to there being no evidence out there saying about any problems with playing outdoor sport and the transmission rate. If anything, we know the risk is extremely low,” he added. McFlynn, a former PE teacher, said that despite schools currently not open to all pupils, it has no direct relevance to outdoor sport.     “With children being in a classroom all day and it is not ventilated, there is more of a risk and hence thats why schools are closed. “The fact that outdoor transmission is minimal, really and truly kids should be back at sport and thats where itcame from.” He points to pupils not only missing the academic side of school, but the social side and playing with their friends. Measures can be put in place to alleviate some of the stress and pressure with the dficulties they are having without sport. “Sport is definitely something that should be done in a safe way, provided the right mitigations are in place,” adds McFlynn, who now lives in Maghera and coaches Glen Us. “Ones were seeing it on a personal level, the effect it was having on their own kids. My own boys are trying to get outside and they are reaching for an iPad and a phone, you want to get them out and away from that. You can see how easy they can get drawn into something like that.” McFlynn speaks of the focus on mental health and the need to interact with others. “For a lot of kids it is about reconnecting. Some kids will come out of this and they will be suffering from mild anxiety and some even more so” he adds. When he gets a chance to begin coaching again, everything will centre around fun in a safe environment, with all the necessary precautions. “Our emphasis is about getting back out on a pitch and running about free, something they were not able to do with the restrictions,” he outlines. The thought of playing against any opposition, mixing communities or competitive games, shouldnt be entertained until sporting bodies are given the green light to proceed. For McFlynn, the danger will be clubs and coaches who will want to do more, with the fear of falling behind or to steal a march of everyone . “Clubs have got to forget that their teams have missed out on almost a year of football and they are going to be behind in their development. Everybody has lost that. “Unless they have got back to reconnect properly and got back in the social scene, it wont matter what comes after it. Their mind needs to be free from the pressures of competing for as long as possible.” He also states that, should the powers that be signal ato sport in a safe environment, it needs to be clear and clubs need to adopt a strong stance. “Thats the big thing,” McFlynn stresses. “There can be no mixed messages or grey area when we go back. Its a case of having everything done as safely as possible.” He references players without an available lt pooling with others outside their bubble, or even parents congregating to watch, with no social distancing. “That cant happen,” he adds. “The onus is on the clubs and mentors to be responsible and that needs to be overseen by those on a youth committee or the hierarchy of a club. “If this isnt happening, then somebody needs to be strong enough to step in and say this needs to change or theyll call a halt to it.” McFlynns thoughts have been echoed by former Dungiven and Derry player Liam McElhinney, who is urging politicians to bring about ato outdoor sport. McElhinney, a former teacher in St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, is now teaching in Rossmar Special School in Limavady and is a local representative for Aontuacute. Liam McElhinney “It’s terrible that our youth have been forgotten about during the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown that followed,” he outlined in a statement to the County Derry Post. While insisting on the importance to adhere to all the guidelines during the pandemic, McElhinney says its absolutely vital that young people are back participating in sport. “Sporting activities will develop important character building and lelong values in children which will have a positive impact in their lives,” he stated. “As a former player and coach, I believe that all sports at youth level needs to be prioritised as society emerges from lockdown – in particular children who are disabled and those from socially deprived areas.” He references experts in physical education being critical of the decision to curtail outdoor sport with no evidence of outdoor transmission. “Young people need their sport now more than ever, as they are rapidly becoming our forgotten generation who have lost so much in their young lives,” added McElhinney, who has coached at club and school level. “It is vital that we resume our sports as soon as possible for both the physical and mental wellbeing of our children. “Sports clubs throughout the island of Ireland will be devastated to learn that despite the gradualto school for our children, there is no change in sight for outdoor sports. Our young sports people need to be brought back sooner rather than later, through structured and organised competition. I firmly believe that the time is now rather than later to ensure the physical and mental wellbeing of our children.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Their mother Marcella taught in New Row Primary School and their uncles – James and Malachy McAfee – played for Ballerin and Derry. They were among five sets of sisters, as the names Pickering, OKane, Totten and Mulholland also featured heavily on the team-sheet. It was a team that, without wiping all before it in the underage ranks, matured to form a senior team that would come to the top and knock on the door of four county finals. “Mary McAuley, she won player of the matchand she was  and a real old hand,” Maura points out. “There was a real mix...our Katie was playing and she was only  or . “It was a mixture of old hands that had been playing camogie for years for Castledawson and some of the younger ones.” The  was littered with players who tasted success at minor level with Derry and on the Ulster College scene with St Marys Magherafelt. Sharpshooter Róisín Pickering hit - in UUJs Ashbourne Cup Final win over UL. A talented bunch was beginning to form. At club level, a minor title in the late nineties brought through five or six players to the senior ranks. It was followed by seasons of frustration with a host of first round exits. “Wed have got beat by Bellaghy, Swatragh and Lavey...we could never get over the hurdle,” Maura explains. Any team knocking on the door of success will have a turning point. Malachy McToal and Tommy Cox took the reigns in the  season that saw Castledawson make their greatest stride to date. Going into their semi-final with Swatragh that year, the Dawson were underdogs. The Davitts had  titles to their name and after a staggering  in succession, they were chasing another five-in-a-row. “We beat them, it was a big scalp,” Maura points out. “They were high and flying and werent expecting it...and to be fair, neither were we.” The result was just the tonic. Katie McAuley scored three goals in an enthralling - to - win. Once Castledawson got their noses in front, they battened down the hatches at the back. It was time to stand up. “We threw everything into the back line to keep them out,” Maura remembers. “You couldnt let that Swatragh team near the goals or theyd have opened you up.” It was a seismic step forward, one to foster belief. Though, thats where their title hopes ended. In the decider, Lavey ran out - to - winners on the way to four titles inside six years. Castledawson just couldnt find their semi-final form and reach the same heights. “As they say, you have to lose a final to win one” offers Maura. The following year, Castledawson werent in the reckoning, yet didnt disappear from the pecking order. In  they ed for another crack at the title. It was their time. *** Paddy Henry senior was taken too soon. Maura McAuley still remembers her sister Únas phone call. It was Saturday, August , , just two years after managing Castledawson to championship glory, and down the line filtered the tragic news that Paddy passed away. “It was awful at the time,” Maura said. “It was such a short time after us winning the championship and although he wasnt with usthat year, well never forget him for what he did. Katie, Úna and Maura McAuley pictured with Paddy Henry senior during the celebrations “He was brilliant and was able to get the best out of everybody,” said Maura of Paddys greatest strength. She remembers after weekends when theyd have been in Dublin socialising, their manager always struck a balance to get his charges back on track for the next challenge. “Hes just  said Ill run the drink out of you and he knew what to do to get you going and it worked,” Maura added. “Others may have taken a dferent approach, but Paddy just had that way with him.” With the experience of having coached football teams around the club, mixed with his infectious personality made him the perfect leader for their ever-improving camogie side. Without the endless array of team meetings that has crept into sport now, Paddy still managed to leave no stone unturned. His son Paddy junior, who won an Ulster minor medal with Lavey the previous season, and Bridie Totten came on board as part of the management. “Young Paddy would have been working with Claireon puck-outs. He was handy with the hurl and hed be firing shots in at her and working with the free-takers,” Maura points out. The two other Henry boys - Christopher and Peter - were also part of the back-room team, who would later help Paddy junior get Castledawsons underage hurling teams get their foot on the ladder. On the camogie front, Castledawson entered the  Ulster League, giving them games against the cream of other counties. Again, it was another ingredient, helping them raise the standard. Despite losing to Swatragh early on in the Derry league, Castledawson went on to win the title and Maura vividly remembers the next training session after their defeat. “He gave us some running after that game, he knew we shouldnt have got beat.” Maura laughs. “Paddy made it enjoyable. We did the hard running and the hard hours.” Later in the year, after a championship semi-final win over Greenlough, Castledawson were one step from realising their dream. Standing in their way were rivals Lavey. The buzz began to kick in around the parish, but the team needed to keep their eyes on the prize. “We knew it was going to be a do die and you had to do what it took to win,” Maura remembers. On the eve of the final, one of the players found the nerves overwhelming her preparations. Paddy seniors attention for detail took another direction, prescribing her an hour in the Thatch and a couple of drinks to take the edge off her anxiety. “It was his way of pacying her and getting her settled...and it worked a treat,” Maura jokes, of their Declan Pilkington moment. It was the last base that needed covered. It was time for Castledawsons date with destiny. They had knocked the door long enough. “We had gotten off to a good start,” Maura remembers of the decider. “Shaunascored two goals and we were doing very well, but of course Lavey came back at us again. “It ebbed and flowed all the way. It wasnt a high scoring match and after Katie got that goal, her  sealed it.” In reports after the game, Castledawsons diamond formation of dropping a player behind midfield was attributed as their master plan. “Paddy came up with that,” Maura reveals. “Katie Pcame back as our defensive midfielder. She dropped back between the full and half back lines, between me and Eileen .” It was their plan for the season. An extra set of defensive handsneeded. “Katiewas told thats your role, shes going to have to defend and push on to support midfield,” Maura explains of their plans. “She came dropping back to help out. Her and Maoliosa Shivers were midfield, they were flying fit and were able to get back and cover and get up the pitch again.” The arduous training sessions and simplistic, yet effective, system, had paid off. Their name was on the cup. But, a Tuesday night county final doesnt fit in with the traditional weekend party slot, of a Sunday night spilling into wee small hours of Monday. “We tried our best,” Maura laughs of their extended celebrations. “We went back to Mary McAuleys house and I remember coming back home at half six the next morning and Daddy was going up to do the milking...he just shook his head at us.” A matter of days later, Rossa were waiting, but the short turnaround ahead of a tilt at Ulster was a bridge too far for the Dawson. The Belfast side ran out - to - winners, on their way to the All-Ireland Final before growing into the machine that would go the whole way in . “It was the Jane Adams show, she was unreal,” Maura conceded. “We had won the Derry championship for the first time and wed go and give it a go.” It was Paddy Henrys last game in charge, telling the squad after the game that he took them as far as he could. A signed Castledawson jersey from  Castledawson stuck together and reached two more finalsbut came up short against Lavey on both occasions and have yet to land their second county title. It leaves a hint of regret, as Maura explains. “The team that we had...we shouldve gone on and won more,” she admits. “To win one, it was special but youd like to have won more, but it wouldve been far worseyou didnt win any and lost in all those finals.” When Cargin set up their camogie club in , the McAuley sisters headed back to their roots and won an Ulster junior title with their native club. “The Castledawson ones always knew thatCargin started up, we were always going to go to our own club.” Maura concludes. But fteen years on, Mauras memories are razor sharp of the night when she led her side into battle and they stood tallest above the rest - the Queens of the Castle.\",\"keywords\":\"camogie,Katie McAuley,Maura McAuley,Paddy Henry,Derry,Castledawson\",\"articleSection\":\"GAA\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"From , Lavey and Swatragh dominated the Derry senior camogie scene.

Of the next  titles, the superpowers won seven each, but in  an emerging Castledawson side annexed their first senior title. Michael McMullan spoke to Dawson captain Maura McAuley as she looked back on their historic success.Light was fading fast, but it was never going to suppress the tension lingering over Swatraghs Davitt Park. You could almost taste the sizzling pressure as the  Derry senior camogie final headed for a dramatic conclusion. The championship had been held up and the decider was prised into an unfashionable Tuesday night slot. Antrim giants Rossa were waiting in the wings, destined to meet the winners the following weekend. For the guts of  minutes, with the game in the melting pot, it looked like Lavey would emerge as champions. The two Shauna Mulholland goals that set Castledawson into a - to - and in cruise control were cancelled out. The momentum had swung full circle. Attracta McPeake and Therese McCann found the net for Lavey, who now led - to - as the race headed for the final fence. googletag.cmd.push In the semi-final two years earlier, Castledawson sunk Swatragh who were going for five in a row but didnt produce the fairytale ending, going down to Lavey in the decider. This year was going to be dferent. It would take until the dying moments, but the girls from the Broagh would get both hands on the cup this time. In the dying moments a Katie McAuley shot found its way into the net to turn the game on its head. In the middle of the pandemonium, she put the icing on the cake with a sweet strike over the bar from a . googletag.cmd.push They werent to be denied. It was Castledawsons moment of glory. Katies oldest sister Maura was stationed at the other end of the field. At full-back, yards in front of goalkeeper Claire OKane, she had a dferent view of that defining goal. “That night...it was so dark,” Maura recalls. “All I saw was the net rippling, I saw it moving and I thought shes got it and we knew then...we knew we were going to do it. “You could see nothing from the other end and Swatragh pitch...it is massive. It was a relief itwent in and you were praying for the whistle at that stage.”     Maura McAuley with the cup after the game With no camogie at the time in their native Cargin, the McAuley sisters - Maura, Uacutena and Katie – crossed the Bann to join Castledawson. Their mother Marcella taught in New Row Primary School and their uncles – James and Malachy McAfee – played for Ballerin and Derry. They were among five sets of sisters, as the names Pickering, OKane, Totten and Mulholland also featured heavily on the team-sheet. It was a team that, without wiping all before it in the underage ranks, matured to form a senior team that would come to the top and knock on the door of four county finals. “Mary McAuley, she won player of the matchand she was  and a real old hand,” Maura points out. “There was a real mix...our Katie was playing and she was only  or . “It was a mixture of old hands that had been playing camogie for years for Castledawson and some of the younger ones.” The  was littered with players who tasted success at minor level with Derry and on the Ulster College scene with St Marys Magherafelt. Sharpshooter Roacuteisiacuten Pickering hit - in UUJs Ashbourne Cup Final win over UL. A talented bunch was beginning to form. At club level, a minor title in the late nineties brought through five or six players to the senior ranks. It was followed by seasons of frustration with a host of first round exits. “Wed have got beat by Bellaghy, Swatragh and Lavey...we could never get over the hurdle,” Maura explains. Any team knocking on the door of success will have a turning point. Malachy McToal and Tommy Cox took the reigns in the  season that saw Castledawson make their greatest stride to date. Going into their semi-final with Swatragh that year, the Dawson were underdogs. The Davitts had  titles to their name and after a staggering  in succession, they were chasing another five-in-a-row. “We beat them, it was a big scalp,” Maura points out. “They were high and flying and werent expecting it...and to be fair, neither were we.” The result was just the tonic. Katie McAuley scored three goals in an enthralling - to - win. Once Castledawson got their noses in front, they battened down the hatches at the back. It was time to stand up. “We threw everything into the back line to keep them out,” Maura remembers. “You couldnt let that Swatragh team near the goals or theyd have opened you up.” It was a seismic step forward, one to foster belief. Though, thats where their title hopes ended. In the decider, Lavey ran out - to - winners on the way to four titles inside six years. Castledawson just couldnt find their semi-final form and reach the same heights. “As they say, you have to lose a final to win one” offers Maura. The following year, Castledawson werent in the reckoning, yet didnt disappear from the pecking order. In  they ed for another crack at the title. It was their time. *** Paddy Henry senior was taken too soon. Maura McAuley still remembers her sister Uacutenas phone call. It was Saturday, August , , just two years after managing Castledawson to championship glory, and down the line filtered the tragic news that Paddy passed away. “It was awful at the time,” Maura said. “It was such a short time after us winning the championship and although he wasnt with usthat year, well never forget him for what he did. Katie, Uacutena and Maura McAuley pictured with Paddy Henry senior during the celebrations “He was brilliant and was able to get the best out of everybody,” said Maura of Paddys greatest strength. She remembers after weekends when theyd have been in Dublin socialising, their manager always struck a balance to get his charges back on track for the next challenge. “Hes justsaid Ill run the drink out of you and he knew what to do to get you going and it worked,” Maura added. “Others may have taken a dferent approach, but Paddy just had that way with him.” With the experience of having coached football teams around the club, mixed with his infectious personality made him the perfect leader for their ever-improving camogie side. Without the endless array of team meetings that has crept into sport now, Paddy still managed to leave no stone unturned. His son Paddy junior, who won an Ulster minor medal with Lavey the previous season, and Bridie Totten came on board as part of the management. “Young Paddy would have been working with Claireon puck-outs. He was handy with the hurl and hed be firing shots in at her and working with the free-takers,” Maura points out. The two other Henry boys - Christopher and Peter - were also part of the back-room team, who would later help Paddy junior get Castledawsons underage hurling teams get their foot on the ladder. On the camogie front, Castledawson entered the  Ulster League, giving them games against the cream of other counties. Again, it was another ingredient, helping them raise the standard. Despite losing to Swatragh early on in the Derry league, Castledawson went on to win the title and Maura vividly remembers the next training session after their defeat. “He gave us some running after that game, he knew we shouldnt have got beat.” Maura laughs. “Paddy made it enjoyable. We did the hard running and the hard hours.” Later in the year, after a championship semi-final win over Greenlough, Castledawson were one step from realising their dream. Standing in their way were rivals Lavey. The buzz began to kick in around the parish, but the team needed to keep their eyes on the prize. “We knew it was going to be a do die and you had to do what it took to win,” Maura remembers. On the eve of the final, one of the players found the nerves overwhelming her preparations. Paddy seniors attention for detail took another direction, prescribing her an hour in the Thatch and a couple of drinks to take the edge off her anxiety. “It was his way of pacying her and getting her settled...and it worked a treat,” Maura jokes, of their Declan Pilkington moment. It was the last base that needed covered. It was time for Castledawsons date with destiny. They had knocked the door long enough. “We had gotten off to a good start,” Maura remembers of the decider. “Shaunascored two goals and we were doing very well, but of course Lavey came back at us again. “It ebbed and flowed all the way. It wasnt a high scoring match and after Katie got that goal, her  sealed it.” In reports after the game, Castledawsons diamond formation of dropping a player behind midfield was attributed as their master plan. “Paddy came up with that,” Maura reveals. “Katie Pcame back as our defensive midfielder. She dropped back between the full and half back lines, between me and Eileen .” It was their plan for the season. An extra set of defensive handsneeded. “Katiewas told thats your role, shes going to have to defend and push on to support midfield,” Maura explains of their plans. “She came dropping back to help out. Her and Maoliosa Shivers were midfield, they were flying fit and were able to get back and cover and get up the pitch again.” The arduous training sessions and simplistic, yet effective, system, had paid off. Their name was on the cup. But, a Tuesday night county final doesnt fit in with the traditional weekend party slot, of a Sunday night spilling into wee small hours of Monday. “We tried our best,” Maura laughs of their extended celebrations. “We went back to Mary McAuleys house and I remember coming back home at half six the next morning and Daddy was going up to do the milking...he just shook his head at us.” A matter of days later, Rossa were waiting, but the short turnaround ahead of a tilt at Ulster was a bridge too far for the Dawson. The Belfast side ran out - to - winners, on their way to the All-Ireland Final before growing into the machine that would go the whole way in . “It was the Jane Adams show, she was unreal,” Maura conceded. “We had won the Derry championship for the first time and wed go and give it a go.” It was Paddy Henrys last game in charge, telling the squad after the game that he took them as far as he could. A signed Castledawson jersey from  Castledawson stuck together and reached two more finalsbut came up short against Lavey on both occasions and have yet to land their second county title. It leaves a hint of regret, as Maura explains. “The team that we had...we shouldve gone on and won more,” she admits. “To win one, it was special but youd like to have won more, but it wouldve been far worseyou didnt win any and lost in all those finals.” When Cargin set up their camogie club in , the McAuley sisters headed back to their roots and won an Ulster junior title with their native club. “The Castledawson ones always knew thatCargin started up, we were always going to go to our own club.” Maura concludes. But fteen years on, Mauras memories are razor sharp of the night when she led her side into battle and they stood tallest above the rest - the Queens of the Castle.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans for the site, which is located at  Clooney Road, on a plot between Waterfoot Park and the Waterfoot Hotel, were first submittedto the councils planning department in . The original proposal was to build six houses and six apartments on the land. A number of residents in the surrounding area lodged objections to the plans. In November , a report by one of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning officers recommended that the planning application for the properties on the land be refused. googletag.cmd.push Also in November , the owner of the site submitted a new proposal seeking planning permission to build six houses on the land, instead of the houses and the apartments. A total of  objections to the housing plans were received by the council. Its planning department has now recommended that planning permission for the new houses also be refused. However, the final decision on the matter rests with councillors on the councils Planning Committee. The application for the Clooney Road site is scheduled to be discussed at a meeting of the Planning Committee tomorrow. At the meeting, a planning officer will explain to councillors why they believe that planning permission for the houses should be refused. googletag.cmd.push Councillors can then either decide to go with the planning departments recommendation to refuse, or instead grant planning permission for the development. In a report on the planning application for the houses, a planning officer said the layout of the proposed housing does not respect the character of the area and adversely impacts existing residential amenity. The report adds: “It has not been demonstrated that the layout has appropriately taken into account the existing trees and vegetation within the site and its boundaries and will impact protected TPOtrees. “There are adverse impacts on the existing amenity of residents in Waterfoot Park in terms of dominance, overbearing and loss of light.     “The access road to serve the development will also impact on mature trees within the site as will the retaining wall at the northern boundary. “The road, turning head and parking are heavily engineered and the proposal is considered over development of the site,” the report adds.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A further planning application with more detailed plans will still require approval before the plans can be finalised. Permission has also been granted for a new factory building for Specialist Joinery Group on the Coleraine Road, Maghera, and a development of  detached dwellings in the Desertmartin Road area of Magherafelt.

In passing such signicant developments such as additional new factory space for the long established family company Specialist Joinery Group and a new hotel for the district, we are doing just that. These developments are crucial to allow our local economy to continue to grow while also creating additional jobs for local people in Mid Ulster. “Mid Ulster has the fastest growing population of any of the  council areas and with that growth comes demand for housing.

A DfI spokesperson said: “The Department has carefully planned these road works and associated traffic management arrangements in order to minimise inconvenience to the public. “Road users are advised to avoid the area whenever possible, allow extra time for their journey and follow the alternative routes which will be clearly signed on the approaches to the closure. “Completion of the work is subject to favourable weather conditions, however, the Department will keep the public informed of any change. “All work will be carried out in line with current public health and health and safety advice, with safe systems of working in place for staff and contractors. googletag.cmd.push “In the interests of public safety and the safety of the contractor’s workforce the public is asked to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with extra care when travelling in the vicinity of the works.” Meanwhile, a pound, resurfacing scheme on the U Ervy Road in Eglinton got underway last Thursday.

Acknowledging that his departure from the Brandywell  months ago was far from amicable, McClean looks back at his two spells at the club with no shortage of regret. After  appearances under Kenny Shiels in , the Creggan manto Derry City under Declan Devine in , but reoccurring injury problems, amongst other things, saw him play just  more games before leaving to join Glentoran. googletag.cmd.push McClean is enjoying a new lease of le at the Glens, but in the short time since he left the Brandywell, he believes he has done a lot of growing up. “Since I left Derry I’ve become a father, I’m playing football regularly now, I’m injury free and I couldn’t be happier,” he said. “I think whenever I signed back with Derry that was just me trying to prove a point from whenever I was there before. I was thinking ‘I’m back at Derry and I’m going to do this and do that’, but it just didn’t happen. From then to now I’ve matured a lot and I look at things dferently and how I live my le as well, and I would say I’m a much better person.” googletag.cmd.push McClean, still just , looks back at his time with Derry, knowing he would do a lot of things dferentlyhe had the chance. “I do have regrets on how I left things with certain people because I was very, very bitter,” he acknowledged. “Whenever Derry got beat I was finding that amusing even though that’s my hometown club. I was looking forward to them getting beat just because of my own bitterness. I have brushed all of that aside now, I’m happier, I’m in a better place and I wish Derry City all the best and I hope they have a good season.”     McClean has had spells at Derry City, Waterford and Sligo Rovers but he seems happiest at his current club Glentoran, with whom he won the Irish Cup last season. He recently celebrated his th appearance with the club and is much, much happier now that his injury problems are behind him. “From a personal point of view, I’m a lot happier,” he added. “From the minute I walked through the doors at Glentoran, it has literally been a big family. Everyone is pulling in the right direction and it’s unbelievable to be a part of and I couldn’t be happier. “When I was at Derry City, there were a lot of things going on outside football. I had an injury and things between me and the club weren’t going well, so it was best to part ways. “I just want to play football and be happy. I’m not looking at anything . I’m playing football, taking each game as it comes and as long as I’m happy and I’m providing for my child, then that’s the main thing.”  Future Whilst more than happy at the Oval at present, McClean still has a long career ahead of him, and he admits he would not rule out ato Derry City, and making things right at the Brandywell at the third time of asking. “I would never rule it out,” he said. “I pissed it down the drain, the two times I was there. That’s the bottom line. I blamed everyone , but it was my own faults that caused me to leave. I would never rule it out. I love Derry, I’ve supported Derry all my le, and it’s something I wouldn’t say no to. At the moment though I’m just focused on Glentoran and where we’re going.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A council delegation is also seeking a meeting with bank officials.Mr Hazzard described the proposed closure in the teeth of a global pandemic as ldquothe wrong decision at the worst possible time, with serious consequences for local customers and staff.He said: ldquoBank of Ireland has attempted to justy this announcement based on a fall in branch visits over the past  months. This is hardly surprising given the entire population has had its movements signicantly restricted inresponse to a public health emergency.ldquoIn reality, the bank is using Covid- for cover, punishing customers for following public health regulations. This is not just a cynical move, but a slap in the face that will hurt customers, staff and communities. This knee-jerk reaction will leave vulnerable customers without access to essential services.The MP said Sinn Fein supported the call from the Financial Services Union for a moratorium on branch closures until the end of , once the pandemic has ended.South Down MLA Colin McGrath said the Bank of Ireland has been a ldquopillar in the financial institutions of Downpatrick for a generation.ldquoIt is a sad facet of modern le that banking is no longer a face-to-face task like it once was, he continued. ldquoLarger banks are having to adjust their business models as a result of this but it is taking away from our high streets and that is sad.He confirmed that the SDLP Assembly team is liaising with Bank of Ireland to ensure that there is minimal disruption to customers and ldquocredible alternatives in place for those that wish to stay with the bank.Jim Wells MLA said South Down had lost half of its bank branches in the past  years, warning thatthe present trend continues, the constituency will be a ldquobank free zone within the next decade.He said the decision to shut the Downpatrick branch was not a shock as Bank of Ireland had already closed branches in Kilkeel and Rathfriland, describing the trend as ldquo extremely worrying.Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon, Gareth Sharvin, Dermot Curran and John Trainor have also criticised the planned closure of the Downpatrick branch.Cllr Hanlon accused Bank of Ireland of making a ldquoknee-jerk reaction that cannot be justied with many local businesses and families in Downpatrick left in a very vulnerable position because of this ldquocruel decision. She has urged the bank to reverse its closure decision immediately and commit to a moratorium on closures until the pandemic ends.Cllr Sharvin mdash who proposed the emergency motion at Monday nightrsquos council meeting mdash called on bank officials to urgently clary how they will support customers and workers.ldquoThis move will undoubtedly leave vulnerable and elderly customers without access to essential services. It is also highly disappointing that there appears to have been very little local consultation or stakeholder engagement on this decision, he added.Cllr Trainor said that over recent years there has been a migration of business away from city and town centres to the internet, followed by the collapse of trade in traditional retail centres as a result of the Covid pandemic.Cllr Curran said he was concerned that Bank of Irelandrsquos move leaves Downpatrick with just three banks which will impact on customers and the business community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Clampdown.jpg","title":"Clampdown on visitors  ","story":"POLICE are being urged to clampdown on all non-essential travel across the district after tourist attractions and beauty spots were swamped with thousands of visitors last weekend.Despite the continued circulation of the deadly coronavirus, people made the most of the warm weather, swarming to Newcastle, Murlough, Tollymore and Castlewellan forest parks, Delamont Country Park outside Killyleagh, the Quoile River in Downpatrick and beaches and villages dotted along the Lecale coastline.One image of a packed Newcastle Main Street last Sunday posted on social media has shocked local politicians who say people need to continue to exercise social distancing as the virus has not gone away.Mournes councillors Laura Devlin and Willie Clarke have expressed concern about the huge increase in visitors to the district, many of whom are not adhering to public health advice.They insist that there is no room for complacency at this crucial time and have warned that failure to comply with public health advice places others at risk, despite the decrease in new coronavirus cases locally and continued roll out of a comprehensive vaccination programme.Cllr Devlin confirmed that she is so concerned at what happened that she has urged police to deploy additional resources to the Newcastle area in particular, admitting that this would be a ldquodrastic measure to enforce the public health message.She has warned that what happened last Sunday at popular beauty spots and destinations across the district has the potential to destroy local efforts over the winter months to curtail the virus.ldquoThe scenes in Newcastle last weekend had to be seen to be believed, she declared.ldquoWe remain in lockdown and people should only be out and aboutitrsquos deemed essential, or for specic reasons.ldquoI wrote to the First and Deputy First Ministers in the New Year asking that a travel restrictions be implemented, but the  mile from home limit is advisory, not enforceable.ldquoWe are all entitled to our exercise and fresh air and itrsquos vital that we avail of it butwe arrive somewhere and itrsquos too busy, the onus is on us to go somewhere . I have total sympathy for those living right in the thick of this as for many they are prisoners in their own homes.Cllr Devlin confirmed that she has spoken with police asking for additional officers to be deployed to Newcastle, pointing to the need for checkpoints along busy routes.ldquoI think that that the extra visibility of police would make a dference. Whilst this sounds drastic, the scenes from last Sunday have the potential to destroy much of our local efforts over the winter.ldquoWe are hopeful to be near the end of this lockdown and want it to be our last. However, last weekendrsquos scenes are deeply worrying. We know the beauty of our area and depend upon tourism, but not now. Now is not the time.Cllr Devlin said she fears that with the weather improving, the current situation is going to get worse, but hopes that as the vaccination programme continues to roll out, people will feel that bit more secure and safe in their locality.ldquoI would encourage everyone to avail of the opportunity to have the vaccine to protect themselves and others in the community to help us all to get to a better place. It is also important to continue adhering to public health advice, she said.Cllr Clarke raised his concerns about the huge influx of visitors with senior Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials, pointing to recent problems in Newcastle and surrounding areas, including the Bloody Bridge, Murlough beach, Keel Point and Tollymore forest park.ldquoIn recent weeks we have seen a signicant rise in visitors to Newcastle and the growing concern of the community is that many people are too relaxed when it comes to adhering to guidelines on social distancing and face masks, he said.ldquoI have emphasised that there needs to be better co-ordination between police, local council and the Department for Infrastructure. The provision of cones helped deter illegal parking last weekend at the Trassey Road and Bloody Bridge but some of the cones were removed by police. The cones need to be provided all year round.Cllr Clarke confirmed that he has asked the council chief executive, Mrs Marie Ward, to ensure that police are stopping all non-essential travel and are monitoring the districtrsquos tourism hotspots.He added: ldquoI am working with a local landowner at the Bloody Bridge and the local council to potentially provide additional car parking spaces at this popular attraction.ldquoThe lack of compliance to health advice not only puts others at risk, but frontline hospitality staff, retail workers and the community.ldquoLocal residents have made major sacrices to reduce the spread of Covid  across the community and we need to ensure visitors exercise social distancing, wash their hands and wear masks while visiting for essential travel..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Daisy.jpg","title":"Daisy Lodge helping families during Covid  ","story":"FOR families living with cancer or mourning the loss of a loved one to the disease, the fact that Daisy Lodge is running at half its normal capacity still makes it a sanctuary ndash especially through the pandemic.Run by the Cancer Fund for Children, the centre on Newcastlersquos Bryansford Road provides short therapeutic breaks for families.The chance of getting a whf of sea air, a walk along the beach and a view of the stunning Mournes is something that all families appreciate. When itrsquos combined with the care and attention that Daisy Lodge gives to them, it means a rare spell of respite in whatrsquos a truly challenging period in their lives.Normally welcoming just over  families through its doors each year, Daisy Lodge resumed breaks last July after having to suspend breaks from mid-March last year due to the spread of Covid-.Resident Services Manager Raphael OrsquoConnor says that while the centre has had a reduced capacity, his staff of  have ensured that familiesrsquo experience are more intensely therapeutic for each short break.He knows that the  families who have been stayed at Daisy Lodge since last summer have really needed and appreciated the break.ldquoWe are dealing with extremely vulnerable client group, children and parents with cancer. Because of their cancer treatment have extremely low immunity, they would be viewed as high risk during normal times, said Raphael, who is a nurse by profession.ldquoWith the Covid- situation, families have felt extremely vulnerable and having a short break here has been a lesaver for a lot of families.He said that the decision to close last March was ldquogutting to him and his staff, but realised that it was based on current advice and policy.Staff were furloughed for four months, although online and digital support was offered to families and the charityrsquos community services team still worked with families in hospitals and at home.However, knowing how valued the breaks were to families, Raphael and his team did a major online consultation with the Department of Health, its board and families to assess the attitude to a re-opening. The response was that % of families were willing to take a short break at Daisy Lodge.ldquoWhat became clear was because of the high need our families were in at that time, getting the break was essential, particularly for families with someone in a palliative condition. While we are not a hospice, families needed somewhere to come to spend those last few weeks to be together, said Raphael.However, before they opened their doors to two families per week in July, Raphaelrsquos team had major work to do.He explained: ldquoWe had to redraft our entire Covid procedure for hygiene, PPE, the donning and doffing of these, temperature checks with a digital thermometer, etc.ldquoOur protocols had to be of a standard comparable to a hospital ward. Overnight we had to become very clinical, which is something we had moved away from as Daisy Lodge was to be an experience away from the hospital ward.One family memberrsquos feedback comment illustrates what the break meant to them.The Covid- pandemic has made navigating le with a cancer diagnosis extremely dficult. Our quality of le is already compromised and the fear of contracting the virus has forced us all into isolation, they said.ldquoDuring our stay in Daisy Lodge we felt confident that we could relax and be together knowing that everything was being done to ensure our comfort and safety. It felt like a refuge, a safe-haven.Raphael remarked: ldquoWe know we are making a huge dferent to the lives of these families and that despite Covid, they have been able to come here and enjoy themselves and forget about it.ldquoWe exist for families with cancer and kids with cancer, we wouldnrsquot be doing this workwe didnrsquot feel passionate about it.ldquoWe know the magic that this place gives families. They leave us walking on air, feeling rejuvenated, feeling that they can cope with whatrsquos ahead. We know we help them on their journey and the feeling that we couldnrsquot do that during the first lockdown, yes, we were all disappointed.The charity was funded by over pound, from the Executive in July in recognition of the role it provides and the impact that the lockdown had on its finances. It requires pound.m per year to provide its services to families across Northern Ireland.Raphael added: ldquoWe plan to continue to aim for this target despite the challenges of Covid- and the impact this has had on fundraising. We have confidence in our dedicated fundraising team but rely now more than ever on the support of the wider community across Northern Ireland.He says he is proud of his team who have risen to every challenge during the last year.ldquoI have a very resilient and diligent group of staff who they go above and beyond for families. Itrsquos the best team I have ever worked with and they deliver time and time again for families, despite all the new changes and new procedures. They retrained, they adapted quickly and our cleaning regime is now second to none.The remaining issue for Raphael is how to deal with the many families who still require a short break.ldquoWe are on the back foot going forward as we know we have a backlog of families needing breaks. When restrictions ease and we are back delivering five or six families a week, we are going to have a greater demand than ever.To find out how to donate to the charity, visit www.cancerfundforchildren donate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Eimear.jpg","title":"Eimear and Gavin nominated for prestigious volunteer accolade  ","story":"TWO local GAA members are in the running for a major volunteering accolade.Eimear Murray, from Loughinisland, and Gavin OrsquoShea, from Ardglass, have been nominated for the Translinkrsquos Young GAA Volunteer of the Year Award.Seven other members of Down clubs have been dominated for the award, which celebrates the outstanding contribution made by young members of the GAA to their clubs and communities throughout the challenges of the Covid- pandemic.Eimear Murray was appointed secretary of Loughinisland GAC last November.In nominating Eimear for the award, the club said: ldquoIt is a huge responsibility and workload in a committee especially at such a young age.

They were also placed on so-called CPAP machines which are specially designed to help people with their breathing by delivering oxygen air into the airways through a mask and tube.The couple then developed Covid pneumonia and on February  Mr Douglas, who has five daughters with his we, was admitted to the intensive care unit.One of the couplersquos daughters, Karen Watts, said the family felt ldquocompletely helpless at having both their parents in hospital fighting Covid-.ldquoIt is devastating because you think the worst and because they are older and you hear so many stories, she said.ldquoIt was the possibility of losing them both together. It was awful, even one. One would be completely lost without the other. I see that now.While in intensive care, Mr Douglasrsquos condition improved and a few days later he was readmitted to ward four at the Ulster mdash which treats coronavirus patients mdash to be near his we.However, her condition had deteriorated and the family believe that it was because she had ldquolost hope that her husband had been taken to ICU.Thankfully, within a few days of her husband ing to the ward, Mrs Douglasrsquos condition began to improve.On Saturday, February , Mr Douglas was discharged from hospital and ed to the couplersquos home in Ballynahinch to be followed eight days later by his we.Mrs Watts said she and her family was relieved and grateful to have them home and paid tribute to the staff at the Ulster Hospital who had cared for them.ldquoThey [the staff] are not just doing the basics, they are going above and beyond what they need to do. They are absolutely brilliant. Even the things dad tells us about what happened within the ward, she told the Irish News.Mrs Watts, a science teacher who also lives in Ballynahinch, said her family is so thankful to the staff that they raised pound, for them.When the staff were asked what they wanted the family to buy for them with the money, they requested new watches for their unorms and so  were purchased with the funds.ldquoIt was to say thank you for the work they were doing, she said.ldquoThey were going the extra mile for them and going the extra mile for us because they were keeping us informed on how they were doing and they donrsquot get enough recognition for what they are doing.The mother-of-two said her parentsrsquo recovery had been ldquoamazing and said it just shows how quickly things can swing either way.She continued: ldquoMum had lost hope when she heard dad had gone to ICU. Then he came back and the nurses remarked that she was like a new woman. They could see an improvement. The two of them perked up from that point.Mrs Watts said that it was a real a miracle that her parents both got through it Covid and did so quickly.She added: ldquoThey do genuinely spur each other along.

A senior police officer has said the motive for the attack may be sectarian.One of the injured men sustained a broken leg during the incident and had to be treated for his injury at the Downe Hospital in the town.At first light on Saturday, a blood-stained part of Irish Street was sealed off by police to allow a detailed search of the area to be carried out. Forensic scientists also combed the area where the assault had taken place in the search for clues.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Dozen more jobs are likely to go from a Ballynahinch firm which laid off  workers last week.Sources within telecommunications company, Viasystems, have this week revealed that  more employees now face the axe.

While friends with John and Junior, Alan said he was also proud to have known their father very well.ldquoTo say that Jim was an acknowledged engineering genius is no overstatement, he continued.ldquoJim told me that he served his apprenticeship at Stewartrsquos Motor Works in Downpatrick before World War Two and thought the world of James Stewart whom he referred to as lsquogolden handsrsquo because he could turn his hand to anything.ldquoJim then worked for the former Ulster Transport Authority during the war and opened his Antrim Road Garage in Ballynahinch in late  which he purchased with a loan from a family friend.Alan also revealed that Jim and his son John sponsored him when he used to race cars.He continued: ldquoOnce Jim, or JN as he was known, started to help me with mechanical development, I quickly moved from being a back marker to a front runner in no amount of time. Jim always said that % of winning was done in the workshop before the race meetings.ldquoJim was very much a self-made man with an independent pattern of thought and kept his motorcycling hobby quite separate from his business interests, Alan explained.ldquoWhile he preferred not to align himself with any dealership other than David Brown Tractors, for whom he did development work and sold numerous new and second-hand tractors, he steadfastly refused to repair road going motorcycles.Alan revealed that it was Jimrsquos love of motorcycles and an interest in tuning and modying British machines, a process later adopted by manufacturers like BSA, Norton and Triumph in the s that earned him a much-envied reputation.He said James was ldquoalways extremely modest about his dramatic successes as he was happy developing innovation after innovation in his own workshop.ldquoJim was certainly well ahead of his time when explaining in simple terms that engines had to be enabled to breathe easily to make them perform better, Alan explained.ldquoHis new thinking about breathing, valve and camshaft design, carbureation and compression ratios brought phenomenal output at , rpm from an ordinary production BSA machine when the company was the worldrsquos biggest motorcycle producers in the mid-s, long before the surge of Japanese two-strokes.Many years later, Alan said he still finds it hard to understand that Jim Brown was given motorcycles by leading manufacturers with an instruction to keep them winning at world class level, which is exactly what he did.He also revealed that a lot of Jimrsquos ideas were incorporated into the BSA cc Victor machine that Jeff Smith used to win the motocross world championship in  and .Alan revealed that in earlier years, Jim provided Irish champion road-racer Wilfie Herron with a race-bike, as he did for Ian McGregor, Campbell Gorman and Tom Herron.ldquoHailed as a wizard, he personally tailored the BSA bikes which brought Mervyn McConkey so much success on grass tracks and motocross events throughout Ireland, he continued.The Crossgar man said that when Jim lost interest in the motorcycle industry because of its domination by Japanese-built machines, he turned to Cosworth, who employed him as a consultant.ldquoJim became great friends with Keith Duckworth, the English mechanical engineer famous for designing the Cosworth double four valve cylinder engine and cylinder head, and was also great friends with Sir Frank Williams and Sir Patrick Head from the Williams Formula One team, said Alan.ldquoThrough my friendship with Jim and his we Minnie and their sons John and Junior, I met some wonderful people. Jim was great friends with the Rev Harold Good who latter became the Moderator of the Methodist Church in Ireland, while I helped the Brown family run motorsport events in the Martin and McCormickrsquos quarries in the eighties in aid of the Ballynahinch Methodist Church building fund.Mr Brown passed away in  with a huge number of mourners making their way to Ballynahinchrsquos Lough Inch cemetery, including leading names from the world of motorsport including Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Keith Duckworth.ldquoI will always remember Jim as a great innovative, pioneering engineer who was fired by his own initiative.

His nephew Pat Rice was a member of the Down team whichfamously brought the Sam Maguire Cup north of the border for the first time in .Reared at Bunkers Hill, he played soccer for Castlewellan Stars and neighbours Annsborough, before he went on to shine with Belfast United in the midst of World War One.Following the end of the war he came to the attention of Arsenalrsquos talent scouts and was whisked off to the famous London club in , in time for theirto the First Division following promotion.He made his debut against Everton in the newly-built Highbury stadium in October . Wearing the No  shirt, he helped his new team-mates to a - victory. He would go on to make  appearances for the Gunners.Arsenal, like so many post-war clubs, were one in ious stages of flux. The team would change regularly with players often struggling to keep their place for one reason or another.In his second season at the club, he did not feature until December.Arsenal would end the campaign ninth in the table.Despite his infrequent Arsenal appearances, international honours came along. He made his Ireland debut on April , , against Wales. The match at Windsor Park was played in front of a crowd of , and finished in a - draw. He would play eight times in all for Ireland.The arrival of the great Herbert Chapman as manager of Arsenal in  coincided with even fewer chances for Toner.He played only two games at the start of the - season and in January  he went north of the border and signed for Scottish side St Johnstone.However, he was immediately hit by injury, breaking his leg in his first full season. That injury would ultimately force him out of the club at the end of the - season after  games.The following year he ed home to Northern Ireland, going on to coach Coleraine. In fact on one occasion, owing to so many injuries in the Bannsidersrsquo team, he even made a playing appearance.A descendant of Joersquos, Peter Toner, who now lives in Cumbria in England, said Joersquos achievements were a source of great pride to his family.ldquoI had a telephone conversation with his late son Gerard [who passed away in ], who was immensely proud of his fatherrsquos footballing prowess, Peter said.ldquoHe claimed that Joe excelled in any position on the pitch. He recalled him playing for a Whitehaven side, as well as another team in a town a few miles away. That team, we later confirmed, was Cleator Moor.Remarkably, Joe is also remembered with affection at St Johnstone, even though it is almost century since he played for the Perth-based club, which plays at Muirton Park.The official St Johnstone club website still publishes a testament to his role in their history today.ldquoJoe Tonerrsquos place in St Johnstone history is assured by virtue of one simple fact: he was the first player to receive international recognition while playing for the club. He came to Perth from Woolwich Arsenal, having already been capped for his country ndash which was Ireland.ldquoA tricky, pocket-sized left winger, he had an unfortunate start to his Muirton career. He signed in January , and made his debut on the sixth of that month in a First Division match against Motherwell.ldquoSaints lost -, but the Perthshire Advertiser, displaying an unusual degree of inaccuracy noted: lsquoThe Englishman [sic], who is by no means a giant, gave indications of being a sound investment for the Saints. He made the most of any chances he got, but I do feel that he was needlessly starved in the second halfrsquo.In his relatively brief time at Muirton Park he had distinguished himself by becoming the clubrsquos first capped international player.Upon moving back to Castlewellan, his le was touched by tragedy after his we Elizabeth died in her early s from influenza.

However, only the female species of buckthorn exists in Northern Ireland and so concerns of this taking over are exaggerated and unfounded.Cllr Brown said the area containing the buckthorn proposed to be grazed is a natural habitat for many hedgehogs and badgers which will be disrupted and possibly displaced by the proposed grazing.He also said residents are concerned about badger baiting in the area which they fear will be made easier when sets are exposed due to the removal of natural grasses.ldquoThere are also issues around property disputes and Cllr Enright and I feel strongly that Newry, Mourne and Down Council should not be erecting fences until ownership of the property has been established, continued Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoMoreover, the money being spent on this scheme would be much better used to protect the dune-front from erosion using the same beach restoration strategies deployed in Ballyhornan. We would suggest this is a much better use of ratepayerrsquos money and urge DAERA and the council to utilise these other beach restoration strategies instead.Cllr Enright argued that grazing cattle will cause ldquosevere degradation of natural dunes which far outweighs the minimal risk from any invasive species, suggesting that the current proposals will severely impact on the coastal landscape.ldquoPermitting grazing at the seafront facing part of the dunes will only accelerate the massive loss of dunes due to unprotected footfall from thousands of people every year, as has been seen at sites such as Ballyhornan, he contended.ldquoIt is vital that Lyme, sand scutch and marram grasses that form the dunes are protected from footfall as they donrsquot regrow after the second or third time their underground growing tips are walked upon.Cllr Enright said that while there is a need to enclose parts of the dunes to combat erosion caused by human footfall and littering, he and Cllr Brown question the decision to use barbed wire given the large number of children and animals that visit the area.He added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council should provide visitors with clear messaging around what parts of the beach they can walk on,andwire has to be used, it should be sheep wire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-Ciara.jpg","title":"Portaferry’s Ciara set to miss out on Euros  ","story":"PORTAFERRYrsquoS Ciara Mageean has withdrawn from the Ireland team to take part in the European Indoor Athletics Championships, which begin tomorrow in Poland.In a shock announcement, Mageean said she was taking the decision after recent ldquosetbacks.The -year old has struggled in her two most recent indoor races in Germany and England.ldquoI am just not where I want to be in order to compete in the European Indoor Champs and do myself and the Irish vest justice, she said.Mageean won the bronze medal in the m at the last European Championships in Glasgow two years ago.She said she had decided to opt out of the championships following consultations with her Manchester-based coach Steve Vernon.She said she felt the decision was the right one in order to best prepare for the summer ahead.

Every single penny counts.Grace added: ldquoWe want to say a huge thank you to Steven and everyone who has supported sales of his amazing calendar..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3March2021-When.jpg","title":"When Frankie Fitzsimons claimed his final winner  ","story":"THE East Down point-to-point meeting of , which took place on March  at David Corbettrsquos estate at Tyrella, brought the curtain down for Frankie Fitzsimons.The popular Downpatrick jockey decided to call time on his long and successful career in the saddle after winning the opening race, the Alan Dunlop confined hunt race on his own horse, Killinick Robyn.Frankie always said to me that when he made the decision to retire, I would be the first reporter to know. True to his word, he informed me right away, sayingPeter Scudamore could do it, so could he.The race saw  of the  entries go to post, with Frankie making the early running. With three fences to go, the leader was Dave Anthony, ridden by John Bright, with Brian Hamilton chasing on John Turleyrsquos Friendless Friend.Anthony then crashed out and Hamilton was unseated from Fearless Friend, leaving Frankie on Killinick Robyn to win from Darragh Cross owner Judith OrsquoGradyrsquos Another Partner, ridden by James Lamb, with Raymond Martinrsquos Kasperova and Paul Parkin third.The best horses that Frankie rode over the years were Jim Gloverrsquos Hopersquos Choice, trained by his father and namesake, Frankie Sr.Frankie Sr also owned and trained young Frankiersquos first winner under rules, Bright Trick, in a Hunterrsquos Chase at Downpatrick in .One of his most notable winners was Joe Rearsquos Palo. Trained by Peter McCreery, it was the result of a big gamble the day that Frankie rode it to success at Navan.His reward that day from Joe, renowned as Downpatrickrsquos ldquobusy draper, was a new suit. I believe he still wears it on special occasions.The following week at Johnnie Grantrsquos Ramble Inn at Ballykilbeg, Frankie threw a big party for all his friends in the sport. I was lucky enough to be invited and it was a great night. Former amateur and top local funny man Terence McKeag was acting as MC. Frankie took to the stage to play the guitar and sing.Thankfully, Frankie has not been lost to the sport as he is now an officer at point-to-points, as well as being the inspector of courses. He is also a qualied steward at meetings north and south.Also at Tyrella in  there was a local winner in the two-winner race with Moving Statue, trained at Banbridge by Leo Young and ridden by Alfie Evans winning for Dromara owner David Hanna.The six-year old geldings race saw Ian Buchanan ride his own Some Day Soon to success and the Douglas and Cromie Maiden race was won by Mrs Stuart Catherwoodrsquos Bad Boy, ridden by Paddy Graffin.In the open race, Pyral, owned and trained by Moirarsquos Therese OrsquoNeill, and ridden by Graeme Martin proved to be too good for the hot favourite Mill Park Bay, ridden by Pat Kelly.At the Warwick meeting on Friday, Downpatrick jockey Caoilin Quinn recorded his first success for an outside stable when he won the racingtv Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle on the   favourite Eaton Miller, trained by R Potter.Despite the fact that the race was for conditional jockeys, Caoilin was again listed on the card as a Mr. He had been a professional at this stage since early-January.This is something that does not make sense as, at present, amateur riders are unable to compete and sadly will not be able to do so at the Cheltenham Festival.They have always been a big feature of the action there, with so many Irish riders involved. Top riders like Patrick Mullins, Derek OrsquoConnor, Noel McParlan, Jamie Codd, and Barry OrsquoNeil are as effective as any professional.They are working with horses every day of the week, so it is a big disappointment for them and many others.Congratulations to Cumbria- based Downpatrick jockey Danny McMenamin on riding his th career winner. He led   shot Archie Brown at the recent Market Rasen meeting.At present, Danny leads the conditional jockeys title race on  winners. He is five ahead of Cork-born Bryan Carver. He started off in pony racing and is based with Nicky Richards, as was Anthony Dobbin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/12384968.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He does not live up to his full title the Right Honourable Boris Johnson, says Davy WightAugust . The Right Honourable Boris Johnson MP, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, promised. “There will be no border down the Irish Sea - over my dead body.”As of today’s date, despite attempted denial by Johnson’s obviously purblind familiar Lewis, that border demonstrably exists and Johnson still appears to be in good health. The PM therefore can claim to be neither right nor honourable. I would suggest that under the Trade Descriptions Act  as amended by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations  those two words are patently misleading, untrue and should be removed from Johnson’s title forthwith.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Not only did they cravenly sign up to legislation enabling that border but now, with the honourable exception of Lyons, they are actively, and some might add treasonably, facilitating the border’s operation. They are voluntarily providing both infrastructure and personnel to do border checks and do the EU’s dirty work for them. This not at the expense of EU but of UK taxpayers and worse, the rate payers in Mid and East Antrim. While whining after the event it is these so-called unionists themselves who are making an unprecedented assault on Northern Ireland’s secure position as an integral part of UK. These people are certainly not acting as unionists so they have neither the moral nor the legal right to continue to use that word in their party names. To do so constitutes a clear and serious infraction of the regulations above.Both Johnson and ‘unionist’ parties need now to be prosecuted swtly and vigorously by the appropriate body.

We know that that will also depend, to some extent, on the presence of the new iant.ldquoI think a cautious approach where we introduce the lowest risk children back to school first, [and] evaluate the impact of that - that will teach us a great deal. Then well be able to work with ministers to progress more rapidly, but we do have to very cautious here as we still have a vulnerable population and a signicant risk of cases increasing. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is judged on those awards and the quality of your signings, and wersquore proud wersquove managed to gain that title.ldquoPenarth is also home to drum and bass clothing brand Concrete Junglists which has become known worldwide, and High Contrast ndash who is a drum and bass icon ndash was born here.Talking more about how he got into the industry, Mr King said: ldquoI always wanted to be involved in the industry and realised by  I wasnrsquot going to make it as a musician.ldquoIt just wasnrsquot coming together and didnrsquot feel like it was me.ldquoItrsquos something Irsquom really passionate about but it started off as quite a light-hearted thing just giving away free music.ldquoThen it started to grow slowly and some people started to approach us, and then in  it just boomed with the top  acclaim. We started getting lots more people approach us, and wersquore now in a great position. Itrsquos been surprising.A host of top DJs including Miaszmafrom Florida, and Austrian duo Divisionand Seculahave signed up to the label, and Incurzion has grown exponentially in Florida, Austria, Germany and Russia.But strangely, Mr King says, he doesnrsquot think the label is known about by many people in Penarth.ldquoI feel wersquore starting to get rewards now for the way wersquove tried to really stand out in what is a saturated market, he said. ldquoWe feel wersquove done that by trying to offer a dferent sound and brand.ldquoOur style is deep and dark drum and bass, dark branding and graphic design ndash almost like horror.ldquoBut most of all itrsquos about bringing on board top quality musicians, and thatrsquos what wersquove managed to do.ldquoItrsquos been a massive shock to see how much interest our music is getting from Florida since Miaszma signed. Itrsquos really exciting.ldquoI donrsquot think people living in Penarth really know about this townrsquos standing in the drum and bass industry. Itrsquos quite unbelievable for a small town to have such a big connection, and I think it needs to be celebrated more.As lockdown hit last March, so did all of Incurzionrsquos events, which kept Mr King busy every week.He believes musicians have been ignored throughout the pandemic, which he worries may have caused a mental health crisis in the industry.ldquoAs live events go wersquove been absolutely decimated, he said. ldquoThe financial impact of that on venues and on companies like ours, as well as inidual musicians, has been unbelievable.ldquoBut fortunately for us our digital sales have been through the roof. That might be because people have more time on their hands at home to explore dferent genres, and itrsquos great they feel they want to purchase our music.ldquoBut the major thing for this industry is the live events, wersquore nothing without those, just like every other label and performer.ldquoThe funding has been awful, and the impact this will have on mental health seems largely ignored.ldquoThis is what we do every single week, and to have that stripped away from you for so long is dficult. Itrsquos also our place to network, so to not have that space will have long-term ramications.ldquoI know venues in Cardf that have had next to no support, andit carries on you canrsquot see how theyrsquod survive.With cases going down by the week, he hopes the music industry will be able to start up just in time for those venues and for musicians.ldquoWersquore obviously very eager to get back to le as it was, and to pick up where we left off.To find out more about Penarthrsquos Incurzion Audio, visit https:www.incurzionaudio Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
