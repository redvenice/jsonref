One claimed that he had to once wipe a \u0027substance\u0027 from the actor\u0027s face in a nightclub. It was also claimed that he spent the day \u0027smoking and drinking\u0027 on the set of City of Lies, formerly known as LAbyrinth, in which Depp plays a LAPD detective investigating the deaths of rappers Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.             Possible explanation: Depp shaved his head and bleached his eyebrows to reprise his role as Grindewald in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. It wrapped filming in December and he has scarcely been seen since then . The film comes out in November           During his visit in Moscow, Depp also visited the Mayakovsky museum where, in one image, he looked happy and healthy as he posed with staff          A third image, taken in Moscow earlier in the week during a visit to a state museum, provoked more concern. Depp is pictured with one of the museum\u0027s staff The production wrapped filming last year and Depp was praised by some for his conduct on set including a handful of extras who said he \u0027couldn\u0027t have been nicer\u0027. It was however alleged that he asked a production staffer to punch him during one incident. According to sources cited by Page Six, Depp allegedly asked the staffer to punch him and said he would give him $100,000 to do so. His representatives did not comment at the time.             Depp is pictured in June, 2017, at Glastonbury festival in England when he had a full head of hair and fuller face           Depp is pictured with ex-wife Amber Heard in September, 2015.

It was established back in 1954 by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands.The elite group takes its name from Hotel de Bilderberg in Oosterbeek, the Netherlands, where it held its inaugural meeting on May 29, 1954, at the behest of Prince Bernhard. The group’s initial aim was to revive transatlantic ties between Europe and North America, as the United States and Canada had prospered as Europe, recovering from World War II and faced with the Soviet Union on its doorstep, had seen a rise in anti-American sentiment.The Bilderberg Group’s early leaders deemed its meeting necessary to strengthen North American and European ties as Cold War tensions escalated rapidly.Over the years, the group’s main goal has evolved to promote free market Western capitalism. However, given the powerful nature of attendees and the fact that its secretive annual meetings are held under Chatham House Rules – meaning that participants are free to use any information gleaned to them but are unable to ulge the identity of the person or group who gave it to them – the group has become the subject of many conspiracy theories over the years.When is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The Bilderberg Group’s 2018 meeting will take place from June 7 to June 10.Where is the Bilderberg Group conference 2018?The 2018 Bilderberg Conference will be held in Turin, Italy.            IMF director Christine Lagarde has attended the Bilderberg Group meeting in years pastBilderberg Group membersThe Bilderberg Group’s annual meetings have traditionally drawn many of the most influential and powerful political and business leaders from all across North America and Europe.The annual conference is usually attended by roughly 120 to 150 people, with the 2018 meeting slated to include 131 attendees. Just a few of the reported attendees for this year include tech entrepreneur Pete Thiel, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, Colorado Governor and possible 2020 U.S. presidential candidate John Hickenlooper and many others.Influential political and business leaders who’ve attended in years past include former U.S. President Bill Clinton, businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates and International Monetary Fund director Christine Lagarde.Bilderberg Group conference 2018 agendaThe rise of populism in Europe is at the top of the Bilderberg Group’s 2018 agenda, a development not at all surprising considering the recent success of populist political leaders across the continent and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote in 2016.Socio-economic inequality, trade, artificial intelligence and the implications of the upcoming 2018 midterm elections in the United States are also high on the powerful group’s agenda for this year.According to the press release, the following items are currently on the meeting’s agenda in order of precedence:1. Populism in Europe2. The inequality challenge3. The future of work4. Artificial intelligence5. The U.S. before midterms6. Free trade7. U.S. world leadership8. Russia9. Quantum computing10. Saudi Arabia and Iran11. The “post-truth” world12. Current eventsAs the powerful group’s meetings are always private and no minutes have traditionally been taken, the Bilderberg Group has become a favorite target of conspiracy theorists for decades.          A protester\u0027s sign is shown at the 2016 Bilderberg Group conference  in Dresden, GermanyBilderberg Group conspiracy theoriesThe secretive nature of the group and its powerful, elite members from around the world have attracted suspicion for decades and made it a prime target for various conspiracy theorists.Some have claimed that the group is ultimately trying to establish a New World Order, often claimed to be Marxist or fascist in nature. Radio host Alex Jones has been particularly vocal in his criticism of the Bilderberg Group, branding it as ‘evil,’ ‘ruthless’ and ‘puppeteers above the major parties’ in recent years.Hereditary film trailer, release date, plot and cast revealedTony Awards 2018 host, date and nominations revealedHow to Train Your Dragon 3: All you need to know about The Hidden WorldSnow Patrol tour 2018: All you need to know about the band\u0027s UK \u0026 Ireland showsTyson Fury v Sefer Seferi: What time is the fight, what channel is it on and what is the undercard?Who is Sefer Seferi?

The airfield was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriot capital, was ided into a Greek south and Turkish north area after the brief but devastating war of 1974          Definitely a no-go area: Rolls of sharp barbed wire prevents entry into the main hall inside the decaying Nicosia International Airport. Closed since 1974, Nicosia was the island\u0027s primary airport. It is now abandoned and located in the UN-controlled Buffer Zone which separates the Turkish-occupied north from the south. The airport\u0027s crumbling walls, barbed wire and deserted airfield are a far cry from its heyday, as the gateway to sun-filled holidays in Cyprus          Parts of this plane appear to have been shot at, and scavenged, while the elements have clearly also taken a toll. This picture shows the rusting, discoloured exterior of the fuselage of an Cyprus Airways Trident passenger jet parked on the tarmac of the long-abandoned complex. Nicosia International Airport was used as the island’s principal airport. However it was initially a military air base, and underwent expansion during the Second World War          You\u0027d need more than a mop here: Bird droppings cover nearly every part of the passenger departure area in Nicosia, Cyprus, while in the ceiling above, light fixtures have become rusty because of the lack of maintenance over more than four decades. It\u0027s hard to believe it was once a beacon for holidaymakers, who once flocked to the airport before journeying to and from holiday destinations at stunning resorts nearby. Local wildlife, however, is obviously taking advantage of its abandonment          No passports needed: This office has been boarded up for over 40 years now, with just the sign about the doorway showing its former life as the official border control post. Speaking about the 1974 invasion, Captain Adamos Marneros was flying when he saw Turkish warships approaching the Mediterranean island in an invasion triggered by a coup by Greek Cypriots aiming to unite with Greece.  The pilot recalled he \u0027couldn\u0027t allow myself to be frightened\u0027 because he had to land the plane safely     The former main terminal at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city in Cyprus. Capt Marneros, who was then a 27-year-old pilot with national carrier Cyprus Airway, said he had deep misgivings about making the flight to Nicosia. After a sleepless night in his London hotel room watching TV reports of the buildup to invasion, he pleaded on three separate occasions with the airline\u0027s boss to cancel the flight - to no avail          Spooky too: The former arrivals hall in the main terminal at the airport also looks bare, with debris covering the floor, while an old sign can be seen with the word \u0027Yes\u0027 to the rear, near passport control. Recalling his flight\u0027s approach to the island in darkness, Capt Marneros saw the hulking silhouettes of warships \u0027creeping\u0027 toward Cypriot shores. His warnings to the airport control tower were met with what he said were halfhearted attempts to ease his concerns          A dilapidated plane, lies abandoned on the tarmac. Capt Marneros was among the last to leave the airport during an evacuation. As he left in his car, he caught sight of Turkish paratroopers just north of the airport drifting down from the skies          \u0027I could see the paratroopers\u0027 eyeballs,\u0027 Capt Marneros said, \u0027and the guns strapped to their gear.\u0027 His aircraft, one of the airline\u0027s four Tridents, was later wheeled to the head of the runway in a bid to prevent Turkish planes from landing. It was promptly blown to bits by Turkish bombs          Nicosia International Airport was once the main airfield for Cyprus, but it has taken on a \u0027ghostly\u0027 appearance after being been shut to passengers for 44 years. Located near the Cypriot capital of Nicosia, this airport has not had a commercial flight since 1977 – three years after a coup d’etat by Greek nationalists and an invasion by Turkish forces          It\u0027s hard to fathom now, but this hole-strewn hallway in the arrival terminal was once part of a modern, new terminal designed by a German company, which opened on March 27, 1968. The new terminal could accommodate 800 passengers at one time and the parking apron eleven aircraft. Nicosia International Airport now stands thick with dust while old aircraft decay next to the landing strips outside in the largely disused airport located 8.2km west of the Cypriot capital city of Nicosia          Also abandoned, this is the former Nicosia International Airport control tower which has deteriorated dramatically since the the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. Currently, the runways and main airfield facilities are principally under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNFICYP) in Cyprus. The control tower is adjacent to the terminal building and two surviving aircraft, an Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Trident, which also lie derelict          A sign reading \u0027Tipping porters not allowed\u0027 has somehow remained upright, among rolls of barbed wire below a decades-old advertisement for Seiko watches inside the once state-of-the-art terminal. Once an emblem of the young republic\u0027s growing confidence just 14 years after independence from British colonial rule, the airport overnight became a symbol of a future hijacked by unresolved conflict. The airport was the scene of intense fighting during the invasion in 1974          This would have once been a bustling part of the terminal, where people gathered to grab a bite to eat, at the airport cafe. A bar can still be seen in the background, with a few dilapidated shelves and cupboards. During the invasion, Turkish forces tried to seize the international airport and effectively encircle the capital. Taking heavy losses, the attackers failed amid fierce resistance, prompting United Nations peacekeepers to take it over and declare it a U.N. protected zone          A sad sight: The shell of an airplane, which has been sitting for 44 years at the abandoned Nicosia International Airport in Nicosia, Cyprus. All that remains is the exterior of the plane, as the rest of its key features have been gutted for years. The airport\u0027s grounds remain the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island and serve as the venue for U.N.-mediated reunification talks. Herders can sometimes be seen moving their goats across the airport tarmac          Debris and bird droppings cover what were once comfortable chairs for those visiting Cyprus, while the floor of the passenger departure area at the former airport is also a mess. Crumbling walls, with ripped cigarette advertisements, can also be seen in the background of Nicosia International Airport. Larnaca International Airport (LCA), a new airport, was opened in the Republic of Cyprus in 1975, after Nicosia\u0027s closure, while Paphos International Airport (PFO) followed in 1983            The former baggage claim hall at Nicosia International Airport stands decaying inside the buffer zone on the southern, Greek side of the ided city on March 7, 2017 in Nicosia, Cyprus. The airport was abandoned following the ceasefire of the 1974 war and today stands derelict. Nicosia, the Cypriotic capital, has been ided into a Greek south and Turkish north ever since the brief but devastating war of 1974. Since then United Nations peacekeepers have maintained a buffer zone          Smoke rises from bomb explosions during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974          The July invasion eventually resulted in some 3 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced, while about 37 per cent of the island was occupied in the second Turkish invasion the following month          Grief-stricken relatives contemplate the fate of their loved ones who have gone missing during the invasion          British troops hand out food rations to Cypriot refugees during the crisis          Desperate Islanders clasp photographs of their loved ones who have vanished since Turkey invaded Cyprus          Turkish troops during the July invasion.

The set, made up of 5,550 pieces and a custom-made landscape ten square metres large          Mr Wrobel  gave up work full-time work around five years ago and decided he had enough figurines to recreate the battle.

The 4m x 2.5m diorama representing the actual battlefield of 6km x 4km dominates a loft extension. Mr Wrobel told Kent Live: \u0027My eldest son moved out about five years ago. hat was probably the other catalyst - I finally had a room to do it.\u0027He was very upset,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said in jest, \u0027he can\u0027t come back - he would have to sleep under the table.\u0027 \u0027I would not want my wife to know the total cost,\u0027 Mr Wrobel said, \u0027but it will run into thousands of pounds.          Mr Wrobel spent hours studying what the battlefield at the Battle of Waterloo looked like in order to create the best possible replica of the scene          Mr Wrobel holds up two figurines which are part of his 5,550-strong collection. Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display          The level of detail that has gone into finishing this replica of the Battle of Waterloo is second to none. The trees, houses, fields and land have been copied to match what the scene looked like in 1815\u0027She thinks it\u0027s insane. She can\u0027t understand why anybody could be the least bit interested.\u0027But having seen the finished project I think even she can feel the wow factor.\u0027Mr Wrobel said he had always been interested in military history tactics, which was one of the motivations for finally finishing his impressive display.He said: \u0027Waterloo was a seminal battle in history that marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars - and it\u0027s also the same date as my birthday.\u0027The uniforms of that period are very colourful so it is visually very impressive.\u0027And then when I semi-retired I thought I was not far off having all the figures for Waterloo, and I thought I better build the landscape for it. That\u0027s taken me about five years.\u0027Despite having no background in model making, Mr Wrobel believe his design is the best in its scale.  He said: \u0027I have really gone to a lot of trouble going through old maps and drawings to get it right.\u0027I\u0027m pretty pleased with it in terms of its accuracy.\u0027 Mr Wrobel still has to act out the key moments of the battle and document it in his photobook.He said: \u0027I think that will take me a couple of years, and then when I am done I will do it all again but, but moving all the troops doing what in my view Napoleon should have done.\u0027So I will do my photobooks of what did happen and what might have happened.\u0027He said there are two professional models to rival his own - both in museums.But the scales are different, and while the most famous one at the National Army Museum, made in the nineteenth century, is much bigger, the characters are much smaller and it cannot be used for war gaming in the same way.           Figurines of French and English troops on the battle, as they would have been in 1815.

The knowledge is driving him to desperation. He\u0027s sure they are buried inside the home where he grew up in San Miguel Los Lotes, covered by ash that swept down the Volcano of Fire into this small community.Lying on his stomach, he reaches into a narrow space left between the top of a window and the tons of ash now filling the one-story house. The ash is almost up to the roof, and his efforts are so futile he stops and weeps softly.Hernandez was talking to his father, Margarito Hernandez, on the phone when millions of tons of volcanic ash tore through a hamlet sitting on the volcano\u0027s slope.\u0027He called me at 3:13 p.m. Sunday,\u0027 said the younger Hernandez, who was working in Antigua that day.\u0027The last thing he told me was to go far from here ... the last thing I could hear was him saying: \u0027Get inside!

Guatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it eruptedGuatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it erupted.Local newspaper El Periodico revealed that from 6:00 am on Sunday, the National Institute of Seismology alerted the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction  about the impending eruption of Guatemala\u0027s Fuego volcano.During the following seven hours, until the moment of the eruption, the National Institute issued two further warnings which were not heeded by emergency response agency Conred.According to the newspaper it was not until 1.45 pm, nearly eight hours later, that the Disaster Reduction Coordinator finally raised the level of alert and urged sounded the alarm for evacuations to take place.  Mario Taracena, a senior opposition figure, wants Conred\u0027s boss dismissed and said the government should investigate whether there was criminal negligence.                         Guatemala\u0027s disaster agency, Conred, suspended the search several times this week, including for most of Thursday. Volcanic activity dumped more than a foot of additional rock and ash on the search sites between Wednesday and Thursday and officials worry downpours could destabilise slopes.Francisco Chavez showed up early with two sons, without tools, to check a collapsed house for a missing son, Edgar Otoniel Chavez, his wife, Sandra Hernandez, and their 4-year-old, Josue.At first they dug with bits of broken boards and sticks in the thick ash, now turned concrete-like by rain.Eventually, a few police officers took pity, and instead of running them off, lent them shovels and helped them in the desperate task of digging.But the huge ash field dwarfed their efforts, and the lack of government help angered them.\u0027They are cleaning the highway - the president has commitments to businesspeople.\u0027But here, since the people have nothing to offer him, he leaves this part as a burial ground,\u0027 said one of the sons, William Chavez, a 29-year-old accounting student.Anger was growing at President Jimmy Morales, who made only one brief visit Wednesday to the area. He didn\u0027t stop to talk to residents or reporters or offer much help. After a few minutes, his convoy sped off to a waiting helicopter.\u0027Why did the president come if he didn\u0027t bring anything?\u0027 said Gloria Esperanza Lopez, 35, who brought tamales to donate to residents and rescue workers, but wasn\u0027t allowed to pass a police checkpoint. \u0027How could he come with empty hands when we come with at least a tamal?\u0027At a shelter set up in a school in the nearby city of Escuintla, Nohemi Ascon, 41, waited Thursday. She is the aunt of six children aged one to eight who died in Los Lotes. A photograph taken shortly after the disaster showed their bodies huddled together on a bed in the corner of a room, covered in white ash and blood.She said other relatives are missing.\u0027My father, my mother, my sisters are there,\u0027 she said, upset over the decision to again suspend the official search.\u0027It is their job. It is not right that they leave them there. They should get them out so we can take them to the cemetery.\u0027           Oscar Chavez (centre) and his brother William (right) and father Francisco, search for their brother Edgar Otoniel and his family, wife Sandra and son Josue          A selection of police officers eventually decided to help as families scoured through the mess for loved ones          The volcano is in the Central American country\u0027s south, southwest of the capital Guatemala CityConred, the national disaster agency, said climatic conditions and still-hot volcanic material were making it dangerous for rescuers, and it was also taking into account the fact that 72 hours had passed since Sunday\u0027s eruption.That is the window beyond which officials had earlier said it would be extremely unlikely to find any survivors amid the ash, mud and other debris that buried homes up to their rooftops.\u0027It rained very hard yesterday. The soil is unstable,\u0027 said Pablo Castillo, a spokesman for national police.Guatemalan prosecutors ordered an investigation into whether emergency protocols were followed properly, as many residents were caught with little or no time to evacuate.Troublesome downpours and more volcanic activity had been hindering searches, but when teams have been able to work in the hardest hit areas, the death toll has continued to tick upward. The official number of confirmed dead was raised to 109 in the early evening, with about 200 more believed to be missing.            Bertilia Hernandez (left) who lost parents, brothers and nephews during the eruption of Fuego waits outside the morgue of Escuintla, Guatemala          Bodies of victims who died during the eruption lined in the morgue.

The synod will include bishops from nine countries of the Amazon basin, including indigenous peoples\u0027One of the main points to be heard is the cry of thousands of communities deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time,\u0027 the document says.Only priests can say Mass. The document calls for a \u0027process of discernment\u0027 within the Church to respond to the \u0027concrete realities of the Amazonian people\u0027.It says the Church presence in the Amazon basin \u0027has been spread precariously thin\u0027 because of the vast territory and its cultural ersity.The synod is expected to discuss the possibility of ordaining \u0027viri probati\u0027 - Latin for men of proven character - to deal with the shortage of priests. Such men would be elderly, outstanding members of the local Catholic community and with grown-up families.Pope Francis, in an interview with a German newspaper last year, said he was willing to consider ordaining older married men as priests in isolated communities.But he ruled out opening the priesthood to all married men or watering down the Catholic Church´s commitment to celibacy, seen as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.Pressed by reporters at a news conference about \u0027viri probati,\u0027 Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said: \u0027The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement.\u0027But he urged patience and caution. \u0027Let\u0027s leave the time necessary for reflection about everything that is in here.\u0027Some Catholic scholars have said the approval of \u0027viri probati\u0027 in the Amazon may eventually pave the way for their use elsewhere in the world as a response to the shortage of priests.The preparatory document also says that, given the size of the region: \u0027It is necessary to identify the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women, taking into account the central role which women play today in the Amazonian Church.\u0027The document did not elaborate. It ended with a 30-point questionnaire in which members of the Church in the Amazon were invited to give their opinion of the main challenges facing the area.

The knowledge is driving him to desperation. He\u0027s sure they are buried inside the home where he grew up in San Miguel Los Lotes, covered by ash that swept down the Volcano of Fire into this small community.Lying on his stomach, he reaches into a narrow space left between the top of a window and the tons of ash now filling the one-story house. The ash is almost up to the roof, and his efforts are so futile he stops and weeps softly.Hernandez was talking to his father, Margarito Hernandez, on the phone when millions of tons of volcanic ash tore through a hamlet sitting on the volcano\u0027s slope.\u0027He called me at 3:13 p.m. Sunday,\u0027 said the younger Hernandez, who was working in Antigua that day.\u0027The last thing he told me was to go far from here ... the last thing I could hear was him saying: \u0027Get inside! There\u0027s a lot of fire out there.\u0027\u0027Hernandez peers into the narrow open space and points to the back wall of the house, where the lahar hit the structure. \u0027That\u0027s where they had the beds.

He\u0027s also sure his siblings wouldn\u0027t leave her. \u0027They would never want to leave my mom. They were always with my mom.\u0027His only thought now: \u0027Don\u0027t leave them here,\u0027 he said with iron determination. \u0027I\u0027m not going to leave them here.\u0027          View of abandoned houses in the ash-covered village of San Miguel Los Lotes, which was  flooded with hot mudOrlando Paez plans never to go back to San Miguel Los Lotes, where he narrowly escaped an onrushing river of superheated volcanic ash as his dying neighbors screamed for help.\u0027I don\u0027t know what they are going to do with this land, but please, nobody should ever be allowed to live there again,\u0027 Paez said.A good question is why authorities ever allowed it in the first place.Nestled on the flanks of the extremely active volcano, the village was square in the path of a gulch that channeled the downhill flow of fast-moving hot rock, ash and debris when the mountain erupted Sunday, burying homes up to their rooftops. While the volcano hadn\u0027t produced a similar town-destroying outburst since 1974, it has been almost continuously active since 2002, and over the past year, it has repeatedly sent lava or superheated flows of ash and debris running down ravines on its flanks, sometimes for more than a mile (more than 2km).Still, locals said that since the village was first settled in the 1950s as housing for coffee pickers who worked on local plantations, such rivers of ash and rock had never flowed through Los Lotes.Residents thought they were safe.\u0027Not disaster officials, not anybody, nobody knew what was going to happen,\u0027 said Efrain Suarez, 59, a truck driver who lived in the neighboring village of El Rodeo and whose relatives lived in Los Lotes.    Guatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it eruptedGuatemalan authorities were warned to evacuate citizens from the danger zone surrounding a volcano more than seven hours before it erupted.Local newspaper El Periodico revealed that from 6:00 am on Sunday, the National Institute of Seismology alerted the National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction  about the impending eruption of Guatemala\u0027s Fuego volcano.During the following seven hours, until the moment of the eruption, the National Institute issued two further warnings which were not heeded by emergency response agency Conred.According to the newspaper it was not until 1.45 pm, nearly eight hours later, that the Disaster Reduction Coordinator finally raised the level of alert and urged sounded the alarm for evacuations to take place.  Mario Taracena, a senior opposition figure, wants Conred\u0027s boss dismissed and said the government should investigate whether there was criminal negligence.                         Guatemala\u0027s disaster agency, Conred, suspended the search several times this week, including for most of Thursday. Volcanic activity dumped more than a foot of additional rock and ash on the search sites between Wednesday and Thursday and officials worry downpours could destabilise slopes.Francisco Chavez showed up early with two sons, without tools, to check a collapsed house for a missing son, Edgar Otoniel Chavez, his wife, Sandra Hernandez, and their 4-year-old, Josue.At first they dug with bits of broken boards and sticks in the thick ash, now turned concrete-like by rain.Eventually, a few police officers took pity, and instead of running them off, lent them shovels and helped them in the desperate task of digging.But the huge ash field dwarfed their efforts, and the lack of government help angered them.\u0027They are cleaning the highway - the president has commitments to businesspeople.\u0027But here, since the people have nothing to offer him, he leaves this part as a burial ground,\u0027 said one of the sons, William Chavez, a 29-year-old accounting student.Anger was growing at President Jimmy Morales, who made only one brief visit Wednesday to the area. He didn\u0027t stop to talk to residents or reporters or offer much help. After a few minutes, his convoy sped off to a waiting helicopter.\u0027Why did the president come if he didn\u0027t bring anything?\u0027 said Gloria Esperanza Lopez, 35, who brought tamales to donate to residents and rescue workers, but wasn\u0027t allowed to pass a police checkpoint. \u0027How could he come with empty hands when we come with at least a tamal?\u0027At a shelter set up in a school in the nearby city of Escuintla, Nohemi Ascon, 41, waited Thursday. She is the aunt of six children aged one to eight who died in Los Lotes. A photograph taken shortly after the disaster showed their bodies huddled together on a bed in the corner of a room, covered in white ash and blood.She said other relatives are missing.\u0027My father, my mother, my sisters are there,\u0027 she said, upset over the decision to again suspend the official search.\u0027It is their job. It is not right that they leave them there. They should get them out so we can take them to the cemetery.\u0027           Oscar Chavez (centre) and his brother William (right) and father Francisco, search for their brother Edgar Otoniel and his family, wife Sandra and son Josue          A selection of police officers eventually decided to help as families scoured through the mess for loved ones          The volcano is in the Central American country\u0027s south, southwest of the capital Guatemala CityConred, the national disaster agency, said climatic conditions and still-hot volcanic material were making it dangerous for rescuers, and it was also taking into account the fact that 72 hours had passed since Sunday\u0027s eruption.That is the window beyond which officials had earlier said it would be extremely unlikely to find any survivors amid the ash, mud and other debris that buried homes up to their rooftops.\u0027It rained very hard yesterday. The soil is unstable,\u0027 said Pablo Castillo, a spokesman for national police.Guatemalan prosecutors ordered an investigation into whether emergency protocols were followed properly, as many residents were caught with little or no time to evacuate.Troublesome downpours and more volcanic activity had been hindering searches, but when teams have been able to work in the hardest hit areas, the death toll has continued to tick upward. The official number of confirmed dead was raised to 109 in the early evening, with about 200 more believed to be missing.            Bertilia Hernandez (left) who lost parents, brothers and nephews during the eruption of Fuego waits outside the morgue of Escuintla, Guatemala          Bodies of victims who died during the eruption lined in the morgue.

By comparison, Brando was nearly twice his size, hitting the scales at more than 15 stone (95kg). The archives show a who\u0027s who of acting legends, all white, considered for the role including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman.In 1963, Attenborough wrote to Guinness, asking him to play the title role, however, Guinness’s agent replied in the negative, with the actor himself following up with a derisive comment about his portly physique: \u0027I’m too big, grey, fat and blue-eyed and would sound like Peter Sellers.\u0027          Gandhi director Richard Attenborough considered a who\u0027s who of acting legends including Alec Guinness, Al Pacino, Albert Finney and Dustin Hoffman          Richard Attenborough directing Gandhi, 1982Finney (The Bourne Ultimatum and Skyfall) also declined.

Hollywood icon Marlon BrandoThe hunt continued as the director realised the idea of having a white actor play the part of the Father of the Nation would not pan out. So, instead of choosing Brando, the actor famous for such films as A Streetcar Named Desire and The Godfather, Attenborough settled for Ben Kingsley, who he had seen in Bertolt Brecht’s Baal at the Donmar Warehouse.Riverdale producer signs a $400MILLION all-cash deal to stay...Shopfitters discover chest stuffed with £1m worth of...Share this articleSir Ben Kingsley, born Krishna Pandit Bhanji, was part Gujarati by descent.

He was looking for an actor the fit the role would Ben Kingsley be interested?

The synod will include bishops from nine countries of the Amazon basin, including indigenous peoples\u0027One of the main points to be heard is the cry of thousands of communities deprived of the Sunday Eucharist for long periods of time,\u0027 the document says.Only priests can say Mass. The document calls for a \u0027process of discernment\u0027 within the Church to respond to the \u0027concrete realities of the Amazonian people\u0027.It says the Church presence in the Amazon basin \u0027has been spread precariously thin\u0027 because of the vast territory and its cultural ersity.The synod is expected to discuss the possibility of ordaining \u0027viri probati\u0027 - Latin for men of proven character - to deal with the shortage of priests. Such men would be elderly, outstanding members of the local Catholic community and with grown-up families.Pope Francis, in an interview with a German newspaper last year, said he was willing to consider ordaining older married men as priests in isolated communities.But he ruled out opening the priesthood to all married men or watering down the Catholic Church´s commitment to celibacy, seen as a virtue that frees priests to devote their lives fully to serve God.Pressed by reporters at a news conference about \u0027viri probati,\u0027 Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said: \u0027The Church is not static ... there is possibility of movement.\u0027But he urged patience and caution. \u0027Let\u0027s leave the time necessary for reflection about everything that is in here.\u0027Some Catholic scholars have said the approval of \u0027viri probati\u0027 in the Amazon may eventually pave the way for their use elsewhere in the world as a response to the shortage of priests.The preparatory document also says that, given the size of the region: \u0027It is necessary to identify the type of official ministry that can be conferred on women, taking into account the central role which women play today in the Amazonian Church.\u0027The document did not elaborate. It ended with a 30-point questionnaire in which members of the Church in the Amazon were invited to give their opinion of the main challenges facing the area.

It means Aramco will not have to sign up to a controlling shareholder agreement, which require the biggest investor to operate at an arms length from the business, nor be subject to shareholder approval for related party transactions.The finalised rules, which follow an FCA consultation launched last year, are expected to make London more appealing for an Aramco listing.The director general of the Institute of Directors, Stephen Martin, said: “The IoD is deeply disappointed that the FCA has decided to press ahead with the creation of a new premium listing category, which reduces key corporate governance requirements.“This decision has been made despite opposition from across the governance spectrum and without providing evidence as to the necessity for the reduction in standards.”Royal London Asset Management said it was pleased the FCA had listened to concerns about changing the listings regime, but that “we still think that the new rules fall short of the high governance standards that investors expect in the UK”.The Investment Association, the trade body for UK investment managers, said there could be “unintended consequences” and called on the FCA to review the segment after two years.The FCA defended the rule changes, saying the decision would encourage more firms to adopt the UK’s governance standards. Its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, said: “These rules mean when a sovereign-controlled company lists here, investors can benefit from the protections offered by a premium listing.“This raises standards. This package recognises that the previous regime did not always work for these companies or their investors.”Bailey has told MPs that waiving rules for sovereign-owned companies will not weaken protections for investors. He met Aramco early last year but said he had not done so again since and had no plans to do so. “To be clear, this was not ined with Aramco,” he said.The new category, which will be effective from July, was welcomed by the City of London Corporation and the trade body for the financial services industry.The corporation said it would ensure the City’s global competitiveness , and TheCityUK said that Britain could not be complacent despite having one of the “world’s foremost listing regimes.”The Saudi Aramco IPO had been planned for late 2018 but the Saudi energy minister recently confirmed speculation that the flotation was likely to be delayed until next year.The valuation of the company will hinge on the oil price. Brent crude recently hit $80 a barrel, but has since fallen slightly in anticipation of the oil cartel Opec increasing supplies after the US asked Saudi Arabia to boost production."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/035342425c1f4eabfd1f46cc407a34cd80671087/0_103_5647_3388/master/5647.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a0a8353d90a2f77d4b60fd020b1b23e","title":"tel avivs central bus station theres a society inside the building","story":"It is vast, decayed and dirty, but the bus station has become a space for ersity in the Israeli cityMost Israelis pass through the central bus station in south Tel Aviv as fast as they can. It is dirty and decaying, its maze of corridors a haven for drug addicts. Abel, who fled Eritrea 10 years ago, doesn’t like working here but says he does it for his kids.When architect Ram Karmi began work on the central bus station in 1967, it was to be one of the hallmarks of Tel Aviv: the largest bus station in the world, a brutalist colossus with seven storeys and a modern shopping centre and theatre. Karmi, who also designed Israel’s supreme court building and the third terminal of its main Ben Gurion airport, envisioned that two million people would pass through a year. He also designed it to be vast and confusing to navigate, thinking lost shoppers would spend more.But by the time it opened in 1993 following decades of delays, Tel Aviv’s centre had shifted north. The southern neighbourhood surrounding the station, long a gathering place for newly arrived migrants, was increasingly neglected. Today south Tel Aviv is regarded by most Tel Avivians as the underbelly of the city, and the station “the monstrosity.”The station’s ambitious vision and flawed realisation – and the way it reflects the priorities and problems of modern Israeli society – are the focus of Central Bus Station, a documentary by Czech director Tomáš Elšík. “I realised there’s a society inside the building,” he tells  Cities. “The building itself is empty without the people.” From the late 2000s on, the Israeli government began sending African asylum seekers straight from the border with Egypt to nearby Levinsky Park. They soon they made the neighbourhood theirs, much to the chagrin of other Israeli residents from marginalised communities, like the long-standing Mizrachi and newer Russian Jews. With the African and Asian people who work in the station largely shunned by mainstream society, the building fosters a community like no other in Israel. Amid the shops selling clothes and knick-knacks are a Yiddish book centre, a Filipino church, refugee health clinics, a military command centre. On Saturdays, when public transport shuts down for the Jewish Sabbath, the fourth floor transforms into a Filipino food market.Nearly two decades ago Yonathan Mishal, an artist and activist, started exploring the station and became hooked by its hidden urban subculture. “Little by little I started gathering information mainly by walking around and talking to people,” he says. “There isn’t any information where all of this is covered in one place.”Mishal and others in a collective offer tours of the station every Friday at 2pm, alternating weekly between Hebrew and English. Israelis do not consider their society to be as erse as the station shows it to be, he says. “When you think about Israeli society, of course it’s very erse, but no one thinks about it that way. People think you’re unified, you’re Israeli.”Mishal appears in Elšík’s documentary and praises the film as accurately capturing the “kind of weird” atmosphere inside the station, as though there is no sense of time or direction. He compares it to the military in that both are “connected to every part of society” in Israel. The station serves as a gathering point, bomb shelter and command centre for people during times of war, as well as a transit hub for soldiers passing through to their base, work or home.“In times of conflict it kind of transforms instantly into its military function,” says Mishal. “But it’s always in the background, like everything else.”Now there are plans to revitalise – and gentrify – south Tel Aviv, and local leaders want the central bus station closed in favour of smaller bus hubs around the city. But the “white elephant” won’t be budged: it is made from so much cement that it is next to impossible to safely and economically tear down.So the station will remain for the foreseeable future. It is “not only a weird space”, Mishal says at the end of Elšík’s film – the neglected urban space is also, somewhat paradoxically, a site of escape.“The central bus station is not interested at all in who you are or what you want to do,” he says. “It takes some effort but if you cross that line and step inside, you get an opportunity to have a safe space to be whoever you want to be.” Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/430a091496123db4bce6265242beacd01a6605ca/1351_452_2690_1614/master/2690.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c2b15e80d7dfd018a580bd83f5fe88c","title":"brexiteers radical rhetoric tory brexit","story":"The Tory ploy of stirring up fear of leftist hotheads won’t work now that it’s the Brexit ultras who use the fieriest languageThe revolution is being betrayed! That is the battle cry of the Tory Brexiteer ultras: that a dastardly counter-revolutionary assault on their sacred project is under way. Yesterday’s latest non-resignation by the Brexit secretary David Davis – having secured a time-limited backstop that the EU will never accept and that has no actual time limit – and his briefing against the prime minister for “Brexit backsliding” was the latest act in the Great Betrayal saga. That the Daily Mail will now be edited by a rightwing remainer rather than a rightwing Brexiteer has only added to the mounting panic. Then came the Boris Johnson leak: not only lauding Donald Trump and craving his approach to politics, but castigating the Treasury as “the heart of remain”.The Tory Brexiteers have dressed themselves in revolutionary garb, posing as insurgent Jacobins. “We have initiated revolution,” as Tory remainer Dominic Grieve bemoaned last year, “and the trouble with revolutions is you’re never quite sure what’s going to happen next.” Their opponents are “enemies of the people” and “saboteurs” and “traitors”. They claim the establishment is seeking to subvert the popular will. To be clear, I think it’s all nonsense – the Tory right are reactionaries, not revolutionaries, who wish to hand the economic elite more wealth and power through tax cuts, privatisation and deregulation. But by legitimising revolutionary rhetoric, they have helped the left more than they can ever know.How can the Tories pose as bastions of stability and order against the revolutionary menace of the left? That was, after all, their traditional posture. They wove a national myth about British exceptionalism, rooted in the 18th-century philosophy of Edmund Burke, that Britain repudiated radical change in favour of moderate gradualism, unlike the hotheads across the Channel. This myth airbrushed out the tumult and struggles of our history, but it served a purpose: to portray the left as somehow un-British, as alien to the national character. But on both sides of the Atlantic the right has adopted a revolutionary style, posing as insurgents against a corrupt, self-serving elite.Labour is run by genuine radicals, who want to end the 40-year-old neoliberal experiment and transform British society. Traditionally, the Tories would have presented this as a dangerous project that promised nothing but upheaval. They undoubtedly still will – but it can hardly pack the same punch, can it? That is no longer an option, is it? The Tory Brexiteers have not only made revolutionary rhetoric legitimate, they’ve made it almost compulsory in British politics. They have stopped the left looking dangerous, and so made a peaceful, democratic socialist revolution all the more likely. And for that, I suppose, we should be grateful.• Owen Jones is a regular contributor to the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28bf192e697b92251a929c2047030fa67011751c/0_312_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c4a9e77f01f74b9ef37624dbb08c5b","title":"mindfulness loneliness tories minister decimated services","story":"Are we living through an epidemic of loneliness?

At Cheltenham science festival last week Aparna Shankar, from St George’s, University of London, described levels of loneliness in the UK as having been “fairly consistent” since the 1940s.But this is the least interesting question to be asking. Interviewing experts in neuroscience, genomics, evolutionary biology, psychology, psychiatry and psychoanalysis has helped me understand something about what loneliness does to our brains, bodies and minds. These conversations introduced me to the theory that loneliness evolved as a biological warning sign, like hunger, thirst or pain, to tell us that isolation is a threat to our health, and we need to find some social nourishment.You cannot simply cure loneliness by shoving a load of lonely people randomly in a room together, because loneliness is not defined by being alone, but by feeling alone even when surrounded by others it is about the quality of the connection, not the number of our social relationships. Feeling lonely makes your sleep worse, and transforms your immune response. Greater loneliness means poorer outcomes for people with mental health problems.Speaking to  readers who have overcome chronic loneliness about how they did it, and reading the shattering testimony of more who are still caught in its grip, has shown me that what works for some is simply not possible for others.So what can be done? It seems Crouch had high hopes when she took up her position, speaking of her plans to make “significant progress in defeating loneliness”. I wonder how she will manage this when her government’s policy of austerity continues to result in the closure of local services that provided not just a sense of community but of vital support to people who are most in need of it. More than 100 libraries closed in 2016, more than 500 children’s centres have closed since 2010, and in the same period almost one-fifth of specialist refuges for victims of domestic abuse have closed. So, too, have many day centres for people with autism, dementia and learning difficulties.This hypocrisy of a government that declares its aspirations to “defeat loneliness” while cutting services that support those most at risk of feeling socially isolated is not surprising. As David Bell, a psychoanalyst and consultant psychiatrist at the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust, tells me, it fits neatly in a neoliberal worldview in which “iniduals are thought of in an atom-like way, disconnected from the cultural and social determinants that form their lives”.This is our culture of self-help, where we must meditate ourselves out of loneliness by being more mindful, or pick ourselves up by going for a run and a yoga class. It is not a culture where we think about our responsibility for each other and for the systems of social and health care that were built to protect people at their most vulnerable – systems that are now being pulled apart.Loneliness is not only something that happens to an inidual, it is something structural that permeates a society, as it is permeating ours right now. While it can and does affect people from all backgrounds, loneliness rises as income drops. Bell says there are particular social, cultural and material conditions that mitigate loneliness, that help provide iniduals with feelings of connectedness with their world.They include employment in a job in which they feel respected, reasonably secure material conditions, and a home in a community in which they feel they belong. It does not take a career in psychiatry to work this out, he says: “It is common sense, but common sense that is easily lost.”So we can throw some statistics around, come up with different studies and try to pinpoint exactly how many more of us are lonely than however many decades ago, but in the meantime, this government, with its first ever minister for loneliness, will continue to decimate the services that care for our citizens who are most at risk, leaving them with no one to turn to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a778b30b89287ecffd1cdbfab88b2f2f2cae4ced/0_94_3786_2272/master/3786.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea3eef7c36360a62cf60e140f5f67e87","title":"save planet meat dairy livestock food free range steak","story":"Farming livestock for food threatens all life on earth, and ‘free-range’ steak is the worst of allWhether human beings survive this century and the next, whether other lifeforms can live alongside us: more than anything, this depends on the way we eat. We can cut our consumption of everything else almost to zero and still we will drive living systems to collapse, unless we change our diets.Whenever I raise the crucial issue of yield per hectare, I receive a barrage of vituperation and abuse. But I’m not having a go at farmers, just pointing out that the figures don’t add up. We can neither feed the world’s growing population nor protect its living systems through animal farming. Meat and dairy are an extravagance we can no longer afford. There is no way out of this. Those who claim that “regenerative” or “holistic” ranching mimics nature deceive themselves. It relies on fencing, while in nature wild herbivores roam freely, often across vast distances. It excludes or eradicates predators, which are crucial to the healthy functioning of all living systems. It tends to eliminate tree seedlings, ensuring that the complex mosaics of woody vegetation found in many natural systems – essential to support a wide range of wildlife – are absent. Unless you can cook well – and many people have neither the skills nor the space – a plant-based diet can be either boring or expensive. We need better and cheaper vegan ready meals and quick and easy meat substitutes. The big shift will come with the mass production of cultured meat. There are three main objections. The first is that the idea of artificial meat is disgusting. If you feel this way, I invite you to look at how your sausages, burgers and chicken nuggets are currently raised, slaughtered and processed. Having worked on an intensive pig farm, I’m more aware than most of what disgusting looks like.This could also be a chance to break our complete dependence on artificial nitrogen. Traditionally, animal and plant farming were integrated through the use of manure. Losses from this system led to a gradual decline in soil fertility. The development of industrial fertilisers saved us from starvation, but at a high environmental cost. Today, the link between livestock and crops has mostly been broken: crops are grown with industrial chemicals while animal slurry stacks up, unused, in stinking lagoons, wipes out rivers and creates dead zones at sea. When it is applied to the land, it threatens to accelerate antibiotic resistance.Understandably, the livestock industry will resist all this, using the bucolic images and pastoral fantasies that have beguiled us for so long. But it can’t force us to eat meat. The shift is ours to make. It becomes easier every year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ed2537fd95a6a6e43e2548401098e39f39ee0f/0_275_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8edd76305245ab2e1a2bd3632e11bf4c","title":"appleby horse fair 2018 in pictures","story":"Thousands of Gypsies and Travellers from across Britain congregate at this annual event to buy and sell horses.

It disproportionately affects children and poorer Londoners.Khan said: “Tackling London’s lethal air and safeguarding the health of Londoners requires bold action. Air pollution is a national health crisis and I refuse to stand back as thousands of Londoners breathe in air so filthy that it shortens our life expectancy, harms our lungs and worsens chronic illness.”Unveiling the plans at a London primary school on Friday, the London mayor announced a four-year study looking at the impact of toxic air on the health of 3,000 primary schoolchildren.The project, led by scientists at Queen Mary University of London, will compare the health of children in the capital with those in polluted areas of Luton where there is no low-emission zone planned. Children are especially vulnerable to traffic pollution, with evidence showing stunted lung growth in polluted areas worldwide, leaving them at risk of lifelong breathing disorders and earlier death. Pollution also triggers asthma, asthma attacks and chest infections.Once the zone is extended to the North Circular and South Circular, it will cover a huge area of London, and officials estimate 100,000 cars, 35,000 vans and 3,000 lorries will be affected per day.It will also include a “particulate matter standard”, after the  revealed every part of London exceeds World Health Organization air quality guidelines for PM2.5 – the most dangerous particulate.Paul Morozzo, a clean air campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “It’s going to have a huge impact on air quality and make a real difference to Londoners’ quality of life. London is leading the way in tackling harmful air pollution.”The government is being taken to the European court of justice for failing to tackle illegal levels of air pollution, and Morozzon said its response to the crisis had been “shameful”.“The government must fund and support cities around the country to offer the same level of protection as London. People everywhere have a right to breathe clean air,” he said.Environment lawyers at ClientEarth, which has defeated the government three times over its air pollution plans, said “political leaders across the UK should take note”.But James Thorton, the organisation’s chief executive, said the London mayor should go further. “A stronger, bigger ultra-low emission zone, brought in sooner, would be key to tackling the illegal and harmful levels of air pollution found across the whole of Greater London,” he said.The charge in the central London zone and extended area will operate all day, every day. Drivers within the expanded zone using “non-compliant” vehicles will pay a daily charge of £12.50.Khan will also tighten standards for the most polluting heavy vehicles, including buses, coaches and lorries, which will face a daily charge of between £100- £300, across the whole of London from October 2020.Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said he “could not fault the Mayor’s crusade to tackle air pollution”.However he warned that there were about 1.2m non-compliant cars and vans registered in London with many will be owned by the most deprived households.“Our analysis suggests that even an ambitious scrappage scheme, as yet an unfunded ask of central government, could leave many of these households out of pocket unless the Mayor puts other initiatives in place to help them.”Matt Winfield, London director for the walking and cycling charity Sustrans, said the announcement was “a vital step in tackling toxic traffic pollution”. But he added: “Cleaning up vehicles will only take us part of the way toward truly clean air. We need fewer vehicles, not just cleaner ones. That’s why the mayor must continue to invest in measures to prioritise walking and cycling and reduce traffic on our streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15a95297b008723a9c4d46ad573318e7f38edb20/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=156cf9626eebf13720764bb85fa0026a","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Foraging wood ducks, an adder taking a dip and a fearless baby rabbit are among this week’s pick on images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e87f81d323dfcc986e5489db0a28af023925563/0_219_6580_3948/master/6580.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67fb849648c8c97707781109992d91d3","title":"the wild workout a yorkshire coastal adventure","story":"The North York Moors national park hugs a coastline made for adventurers and the curious. Sarah Wharton tries her hand at foraging, fossil hunting, hiking and stand-up paddleboardingStay over in StaithesThe eclectic personality of Staithes reflects residents past and present. In the jumble of tiny cottages that spill down a gorge to the harbour have lived James Cook (later Captain), who came to work in a grocer’s store, and the influential Staithes group, a 19th-century artists’ group. It’s home to the Staithes festival of arts and heritage in September, and is a shoo-in for basecamp on a trip that takes in culture, natural history and a yomp. Rest up at the Endeavour B\u0026ampB, where host David Linley is a walking encyclopedia of activities, and heritage tales. He makes a mean breakfast too: don’t miss the kippers from Staithes’ own smokehouse. For dinner, try the delicious crab salad at the Royal George – like all pubs in this fishing village that’s something of a sovereign state, it’s independent and family owned. And if food and flavours really are your thing, then book a day of coastal foraging and cooking tips with Taste the Wild, which runs courses out of Staithes. Co-founder Chris Bax says: “Foraging reflects the resurgence of ersity in food: we let people rediscover things we used to eat but have dropped out of fashion.” The Attenborough in all of us will want to get closer to wildlife in an area rich in flora and fauna from moor to sky to sea. Jump aboard a birdwatching and cetacean safari with ecologist Richard Baines at Yorkshire Coast Nature (YCN) and you might just see some minke whales. Or stay grounded and snap up a seabird photography workshop with YCN’s Steve Race. Find your waveStand-up paddleboarding is “surfing without the faff of having to get up while the wave is breaking all over you,” says Simon Palmer, explorer, who co-founded SUP Adventures with Dan Fawkes. Both have that ex-military knack of turning what should be a gruelling encounter – with messy sea, two left feet or black skies – into a fun escapade and day-long grin. “People love it because it’s so accessible, irrespective of ability. It’s a terrific confidence booster if you’re anxious about getting out to learn a new activity or getting in the water. And it’s an all-body workout too.” Conquer position, posture and paddling technique at postcard-pretty Sandsend or alongside Saltburn’s trim, elegant Victorian pier. Then treat yourself to a follow-up session to learn how to read wave conditions and ride on to the beach. For something more stretchy, try SUP Adventures’ river yoga. Determined to have a Point Break moment? Head for surf spots at Staithes, where the rock bottom breaks produce powerful and defined waves (experienced surfers only). Or dip a beginner’s toe at Whitby’s West Cliff beach with Whitby Surf School. Hike into natureIf watersports aren’t your thing, then hiking along this extravagantly handsome Jurassic coastline, creaking with 200m years of stories, puritanical Victorian glamour and fishing folklore, will definitely get your heart rate up. North Yorks Moors senior ranger Bernie McLinden offers some tips: “Hayburn Wyke is a fantastic place to get to,” he says, referring to a secretish cove at the southern end of the North York Moors national park. “I was there at 7pm last night and even spotted a couple of surfers: they seemed to be having a great time.” With a waterfall that plops on to the beach, it’s a fairytale scene to take in on a circular five-mile walk that goes south along the Cleveland Way and returns along part of the Cinder Track, a defunct 21-mile railway line from Whitby to Scarborough that’s great cycling too. Another inspiring journey is the “source-to-sea” hike that picks up the river Esk at Westerdale Moor and closes at Whitby’s harbour mouth. At 37 miles, the full walk takes three or four days, but the Esk Valley railway enables you to cheat and do a day’s chunk to suit. “You might be lucky enough to see an otter along the way,” McLinden says. “At Sleights, if it’s the right time of year, you can see salmon leap. And in springtime, the woodland areas across the park are just wonderful, brimming with the beauty of the bluebells, primroses and ramsons.” Back in Staithes, if you have just 15 minutes to spare you can sprint southwards then upwards on to the cliff and a new part of the England Coast Path, to get the best view of the waterside hamlet. If you have longer, plump for a four-mile circle, taking in the industrial ironstone past of Port Mulgrave. Paddle back in timeThe Dinosaur Coast has never been more alive than when kinetic geologist, marine biologist and sailor Peter McGrath is talking about the natural kingdom that surrounds smartly turned-out Runswick Bay. He says: “One of ‘my’ best finds in 40 years came from my daughter Ruby on one of her first fossiling trips. ‘I’ve found an ammonite,’ she shouted casually. Not just any ammonite! A rare 18cm Hilderocas bifrons is a very good find.” McGrath is on a mission to discover and photograph every fossilised and living thing he can in the area, and shares his vast expertise with interested visitors as part of local firm Barefoot Kayak’s fossil foray team. If McGrath is the vim in this expedition, topping up your knowledge of fossil poo and Devil’s toenails (coprolites and Gryphaea respectively), Barefoot Kayak’s founder, paddlesport guide and coastguard Andy Monaghan provides the calm – putting the newly waterborne at ease with a deceptively laid-back style that nails safety. Paddling along with the duo is relaxing and stimulating in equal measure. Sea kayaking is manageable for most people and great for independent travellers or family groups with a yen for adventure.

As a complement to JJ he is a No 5 that can do everything: a marker, dribbler, he’s able to sneak in a ‘filtered pass’ and freely roam the midfield. Just in front, Omar Sívori, the fantasist. It could equally well have been Di Stéfano but I’ll go for Sivori – an all-terrain player the sort that would get hold of the ball in the centre of the pitch and lead it right into the back of the net.Then, categorically and without any doubt, Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona – both have to be in. Can I imagine them playing well together? Yes. And finally, the 11th man, the striker Manuel Pelegrina – not just because he’s ‘pincha’ (an Estudiantes fan) he was captain at the 1930 World Cup, top goalscorer for Estudiantes and the national squad, and nowadays we talk so much about the importance of education – well, he quit football to sit the exam that would complete his schooling and then returned to play at the World Cup … an example on and off the pitch, then and now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07968ce15d0829679d477e04aa6dd29ccb60fd08/0_321_4306_2584/master/4306.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=962443347427011d9bd6442d8cd08049","title":"the fiver brazil world cup nets","story":"Sign up now!

While there, he was arrested and imprisoned by police, who confiscated his memory cards, phone and laptopSlavery has a long history in this north African desert nation. For centuries, Arabic-speaking Moors raided African villages, resulting in a rigid caste system that still exists to this day, with darker-skinned inhabitants beholden to their lighter-skinned “masters”. Slave status is passed down from mother to child, and anti-slavery activists are regularly tortured and detained. Yet the government routinely denies that slavery exists in Mauritania, instead praising itself for eradicating the practice.Members of Mauritania’s leading anti-slavery organisation, the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA), hope to oust the majority Arab-Berber government in national elections next year. The IRA leader, Biram Ould Abeid – a Haratine who was imprisoned for years before coming second in 2014’s national elections – has vowed to remove President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who came to power in a 2008 coup and has since dismantled the Senate in what critics see as a bid to broaden his powers.Fatimatou and her daughter Mbarka, above, were slaves to a family in the Aleg region, roughly 250km from the capital, Nouakchott. “They called me ‘Fatma the servant’: I looked after the cattle, prepared food, and fetched water from the well,” says Fatimatou. “I lost two babies to this family because they prevented me from taking care of my own children. I was forced to work when I had just given birth.” Fatimatou was freed with her children in the early 1990s by the organisation SOS Slaves. Today, she lives with her family in one of Nouakchott’s working-class neighbourhoods.Former slaves Habi and her brother Bilal, above left, stand in front of Bilal’s garage outside Nouakchott. The siblings were both slaves to a family east of the capital, but Bilal fled suddenly one day after his master beat him. After several attempts to rescue his sister, who was a victim of sexual abuse and forced labour, she was finally freed with the help of SOS Slaves in 2008. Today, the pair live in a poor neighbourhood on the periphery of Nouakchott. With the help of some activists, Bilal recently opened a small tyre-mounting garage.Mauritania is a bridge between the Arab Maghreb of north Africa and darker-skinned sub-Saharan Africa. The ruling Arab-Berbers have higher paid positions in jobs and government, while the darker-skinned Haratines and Afro-Mauritanians are under-represented in leadership positions and face many obstacles in society, from access to education to well-paid jobs.Haratines do many jobs that Arab-Berbers consider dirty or degrading, such as working in local markets. Sos Slaves provides workshops to help empower Haratine women, most of whom are unemployed, poor and have little or no education. Some workshops teach recently freed slaves about money – what it is and how it is used – while others teach Haratine women skills such as embroidery or sewing, which help them to earn money for the first time in their lives.Mabrouka, 20, was a child when she was taken from her mother, also a slave, to serve with a family in the south-western Rosso area. Around the age of 11, when she was cooking for her masters, she was badly burned on her left arm. She still suffers from the pain. Mabrouka was 14 when she was freed in 2011, but was never able to go to school. She got married at the age of 16 and is now the mother of Meriem, four, and two-month-old Khadi.A Tarhil neighborhood resident outside her house, where she was relocated by the state when her slum in Dar Naim was demolished to make way for the construction of a road. Married, with two children, she sells biscuits to passersby while her husband holds small jobs in the city. “If we had the budget, we would have rented a room in Nouakchott. Here, we don’t even have water – we have to pay for a cart to deliver water,” she says.Haratines work in certain professions that are designated for their caste alone, such as butchery and rubbish collection. Above, on the left, men at a slaughterhouse prepare cattle for sale in Nouakchott. The picture on the right shows Youssef, 18, who is in his third year of secondary school in Nouakchott. A few days a week he works as a rubbish collector to help support his family.Moctar was born into slavery in an Arab-Berber family, where he was forced to work alongside his mother and brother. In 2012, after several attempts, he managed to escape and met an activist from the anti-slavery movement. He tried to liberate his mother and brother, but they refused to go with him. His mother even criticised his escape and testified against him. “When I was younger, my mother told me every night that we must respect our masters, because their caste is higher than ours, and they are saints,” says Moctar. He started school at 13 and hopes to become a lawyer, in order to fight for the rights of the Haratines.Meryem (in blue) lives in Znabeh, a small village comprised of former slaves. In 2014, following the death of their father, the children of slavemaster Sheikh Mohammed freed four women and their children: Meryem, Aïcha, Beïga, and Merine. They all fled with their children and grandchildren and settled near a water source. They now survive off of their small holding and the little food it brings.Salma, above right, served for more than 50 years as a slave in a white Moorish family in northern Mauritania’s Chagar region. Her children were also born into servitude.In 2013, Salma and her daughter Yema were released by her two sons, Bilal and Salek (pictured above), who had escaped a few years earlier. But Yema twice ran back to her master’s family. Today, she is married and has two children. Salma, Yema and her brothers now live together in a slum in Dar Naim.Aichetou Mint M’barack was a slave by descent in the Rosso area. Like her sister, she was taken away from her mother and then given to a member of the master’s family to be a servant. She got married in the home of her masters and had eight children, two of whom were taken away from her to be slaves in other families. In 2010, Aichetou’s older sister was able to free her with the help of the IRA Movement, after she herself fled her masters when they poured hot embers over her baby, killing it. Aichetou and her eight children are now free and live together in Nouakchott.Jabada, below, is over 70. She fled her master after he tied both her hands to a tentpole, which cut off one finger entirely and deformed the others. She is now unable to use her hands. Taken in by another family who helped heal her wounds, Jabada stayed with them until her freedom in the 1980s. She now lives with her children and grandchildren in one of Nouakchott’s poor neighbourhoods."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/592fe40bbeccc30f72e94678ff2ba58a5b61e5fb/0_95_2464_1479/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51d4eee689a425a9a425662f4b6559e0","title":"anthony bourdain made food writing muscular and kinetic","story":"Food critic Jay Rayner pays tribute to the chef who knocked down culinary walls Anthony Bourdain, TV chef and travel host, found dead aged 61 Anthony Bourdain was, by his own estimation, a jobbing restaurant cook who “just got lucky”. It’s a classic bit of Bourdain understatement. It’s true he was never a chef who was going to knock down culinary boundaries – Bourdain was schooled in the French classics – but as a writer he was massively influential, changing forever what the business of food and appetite on the page could be.Before the publication in 2000 of Kitchen Confidential, his memoir of life as a line cook, food writing was, for the most part, a job for those who had pulled their sizeable bellies up to the table in the dining room. It was effete and delicate. Bourdain gave a voice to the career cooks on the other side of the kitchen door the ramshackle, itinerant tribe of restaurant chefs, with their skin burns, tattoos, appetite for long hours and hard drugs. He made food writing muscular and kinetic. He blew the whistle on how your steak was likely to be cooked in a big New York restaurant – by being dumped in the deep fat fryer – and famously cautioned against eating sushi on Mondays, because the fish was less than fresh.Naturally enough, in time, there was a backlash. There were accusations that he was falsely glamorising a life of excess – one he had abandoned – though his fans from behind those kitchen doors wouldn’t hear a word against him. You could spot them a mile off at the public events which inevitably became part of the author’s working life: pallid skin, wild hair, clutching a stained volume they wanted to be signed.Although it was writing that gave him his profile, Bourdain’s biggest contribution to food media may well have been to television. His various series, first for the Food Network, then later the Travel Channel and CNN, had an immersive, nerdy quality that fixed the dishes he was eating to the communities and cultures from which they came. Without him, vast amounts of today’s food content – the various documentary strands, such as Ugly Delicious on Netflix – simply wouldn’t exist.I shot a sequence with him for a London-based show in the summer of 2016 at Fergus Henderson’s St John in Clerkenwell, which he regarded as a culinary temple. He made it clear it was now the mechanics of film-making that most intrigued him. He had no time for the usual artifice of TV: no retakes, no stop-starts, just shoot what happens. As he told the New Yorker in 2017: “I travel around the world, eat a lot of shit, and basically do what the fuck I want.” The fact that Bourdain’s long, rambling journey has finally come to such a sad end will leave his army of fans, including this one, utterly bereft."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09e7228e3a720ba0d33f2299e8d58bad34f4b056/0_0_4992_2995/master/4992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28fc4c3fda46a2f196c741c7f8b999b4","title":"people who swim too fast in slow lane coco khan","story":"Mark my words, there will be an entire circle of hell dedicated to themI reached two adulting milestones recently: I\u0026nbsppassed my driving test and I completed a length in\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspswimming pool. These accomplishments were a vital lesson in expectation versus reality. I thought that once I had these basic skills life would be all spontaneous drives to Cornwall and snorkelling with the cast of Finding Nemo. My life is mainly getting cut up by 17-year-olds in the Sainsbury’s car park, and being too slow for the slow lane\u0026nbspat\u0026nbspthe pool.Mark my words, there will be an entire circle of hell dedicated to people who swim too fast in the slow lane. Don’t these people understand that “slow” is a relative term? If someone (ie me) slows\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspaverage speed of the lane, so be it. Either swim slower or move to a faster lane.

I catch their desperate, goggled eyes when they pop up for air. “I know,” I\u0026nbspmouth.

Oh\u0026nbspno – I see through their pettiness and rise above it. “I\u0026nbspforgive you!” I think, hanging on to the side, and catching my breath as they douse me in water from a\u0026nbsptumble turn. After all, they are just doing what they\u0026nbspneed to do to survive – to get me out so that they can stay, rather than move over and face a\u0026nbspfaster lane. It’s the law of the jungle: kill or be killed splash or be splashed.In comparison, driving has been far less stressful. Yes, you are much more likely to die instantly, but at least you can overtake, do U-turns or pull over for a quick pasty. Now I just need to learn how to ride a bike.

I’m 30 years old, alone on a fake-fur blanket in the back of a cold Transit van. Most of my generation are out there in pubs, or indoors by the telly, canoodling, arguing or cooking, or going across to the thermostat to turn the heating up. I’m parked on a Cornish industrial estate with no warmth except the tiny, wavering plume of heat that rises out of my lantern. This place is so lonesome that even the doggers, boy-racers and stoners have spurned it. I curse myself silently. You’re not a Traveller, my mate, you’re a . What sort of Traveller would come and sleep here on their own? I have covered thousands of miles in my van in a bid to uncover the history of Gypsy Britain. But the road is proving tough.Gypsy reality is partly composed of fairgrounds and showgrounds, picturesque lakeside halts, sheltered commons, bright heaths. But it also comprised frozen copses and hilltops. Old maintenance roads with potholes and bad light. Scrapyards. Council waste ground. Lay-bys near the edges of tips. Slag-heaps and drained marshes. Fen ends. Chalk pits, yards and quarries. These are the stopping places, these fringes and in-between places. They are the places that nobody lives except Travellers – or nobody but those who share ancient connections with them: gamekeepers and poachers, scrap-metal men, horsewomen, rangers and shepherds. They are the old nomads’ haunts of the island. Many are smashed and built over some – magically – are still more or less just as they were in centuries long past. They form the hidden Gypsy and Traveller map of the country we live in: they are the bedrock of our reality and, perhaps, the antidote to the unending cycles of romanticisation and demonisation.I had conceived a plan to visit these places, to live in them in my own way, and see what I might learn. Perhaps I might even solve the bizarre contradiction of Britain’s love affair with caravanning, camping and glamping, and its hatred of those who were born to this life, and who largely inspired its adoption as a non-Gypsy pastime. As one Scottish Gypsy Traveller put it: “There are 80,000 members of the Caravan Club, but I’m not allowed to travel?”There is more to this Gypsy geography than a list of physical places. The stopping places themselves are an outgrowth of something non-physical, something that is ancient, unseen yet important, precious and reviled, envied and feared. This thing is the Gypsy belief – the core belief of the culture – that it is possible to live in a different way: in your own way, part of the world, but not imprisoned by the rules. That you can know the ropes and yet not be hemmed in by them. That you can dwell alongside the mainstream, while not being part of it. Otter-like, you can live in the bank of the river and swim and hunt there when you need to, and then climb back out with equal ease and alacrity. There is no better symbol of this belief than the network of atchin tans (stopping places) laced across Britain they are historical, topographical proof that the Gypsy philosophy has existed here, that it still does, that it still can. By staying at the traditional stopping places, I hoped to answer the questions that had been following me, on and off, all my life. What is left of these places? What might we learn from them? What redemption might lie there, in a country that still passes new legislation aimed at ending the Traveller way of life? Is it still possible to live on the road? Was the end of the old Gypsy life a tragedy, or was it a case of good riddance to an irredeemably hard and pitiless life on the edge? Above all, I hoped to resolve the biggest question: the question of myself, whether I could make my peace with Gypsy culture. My conflict seemed to echo the wider tension between nomads and settled people that endures in modern Britain.On the way to our regular pitch selling flowers in the marketplace in Petersfield, my elders would point and nod at empty spaces by the sides of the road, flat areas on verges and slightly raised banks, vacant pull-ins and lay-bys, and make comments as if there was something there, something I couldn’t see. They were glimmers of another world, but it felt as distant as the stars. I knew the places had something to do with the time they were “on the road” – most of my family were settled now, living in houses or caravans and mobile homes on private bits of land.Travellers I knew from the east of England had lived rough deep into the recent past, still working the farms into the 1990s. By then, it had been the best part of 50 years since anyone in my family had depended on that kind of work. So it came as a shock to meet Travellers younger than me who had grown up picking turnips in January. They described reaching down with a gloved hand and grabbing hold of the big, leafy tops, how it would sometimes send a plug of ice shooting upwards.Alongside selling flowers, my family had roofing and car-breaking businesses. We had a big field and a yard, a word that seemed to mean a place where all things might, and did, happen. Terriers, geese and perturbed-looking cockerels roamed in between the legs of cantankerous horses. Stables were stacked full of the musty paraphernalia of horsemanship, flower-selling, roofing and car respraying. Bits of cars lay everywhere, named as if they were the parts or clothes of people or animals: bonnets, boots, seats, wings, belts. There were brass-handled horsewhips, jangling harnesses, buckets of molasses-sprayed chaff and milled sugar-beet, bales of sweet-smelling fresh hay. But all of this old rustic stuff was stacked and wedged in among the hard and greasy gear of the family economy: gas bottles, blowtorches, leaky old engines, spray paint, rolls of lead, felt, and seemingly infinite stacks of every conceivable type of roof tile. A heavy boxing bag swung with barely perceptible creaks, keeping time in the half-light of the dusty old garage.There were caravans there that we sometimes lived in and out of, especially in the summer. We never considered this odd, even though we also had a big house on the land that my grandad had built with his men. And there always seemed to be heavy and dangerous things lying close to hand. The hard stuff of motion was everywhere, although we were settled: cars, tractors and trucks, some brand-new, others eaten by weather and time horses, ponies, traps, sulkies and carts scattered wheels and bolts from Ford and Bedford lorries. And, hung from a barn door like a pair of swords and scabbing to ochre with rust, there were two axles rescued from the ashes of the last wagon owned by our family.We had a name for ourselves: Travellers. In our case, it didn’t just mean anyone who travelled around, regardless of their race: to us it meant our people specifically, the Romanies of Britain. The first Romanies probably arrived on the British mainland towards the end of the 15th century, and had been a contentious presence ever since.Wherever the Gypsies went, they took with them their strange tongue, Romani, and it was through this that the mystery of their origins was solved. An 18th-century German linguist called Johann Rüdiger overheard Gypsies talking, and was struck by the similarity of their speech to Indian languages. Later linguists, including the so-called “Romany Ryes” – rye being the Romani word for a gentleman – such as the English writer George Borrow and the Irish academic John Sampson, would identify layers of borrowings from Persian, Slavic and Romance languages in the Gypsies’ speech, using these to trace a philological map of their long road into the West. English Romani had German-derived words in it, like nixis, meaning “nothing”, and fogel for “smell”.As for the name of the Romanies, it was derived from their own word for “man” or “husband”, rom, and it had nothing to do with Romania, which got its name from the Roman military camps which once filled its territory. The Gypsies called their language Romanes, an adverb meaning “like a rom”. To rokker Romanes meant, simply, to talk like a Gypsy and not like a gorjer – a non-Gypsy. The word gorjies comes from the old Romany word gadje or gadzhe, and though its form has mutated with time, its meaning is the same: the non-Gypsies, outsiders, the people-who-aren’t-us.Almost everyone who has studied Romani in Britain has remarked on how adept its speakers are at coming up with names for things. In some ways, talking Romanes means having to be constantly inventive and alert, both in terms of creating words and also interpreting the new ones that get spun off the cuff and thrown into daily Traveller conversation. There is no stigma attached to inventing words, as there so often is in English nor are new words looked down upon as annoying neologisms that we’d be better off without. Invented words are more likely to be smiled upon or chuckled at as evidence of a witty, intelligent mind one with a good and flexible grasp of the ancient Travellers’ tongue.Besides, if Romani is to retain one of the functions which has kept it alive thus far – and which it has in common with almost all minority languages – namely, to stop outsiders knowing what you are talking about, then it will always be necessary to invent new ways of saying things. According to a Belarusian Romany man I once met, a word is no longer a truly Romani word once its meaning becomes known amongst the gadzhe – it is useless, dead, and best left where it is. This is an extreme opinion, but it points to a common anxiety: that the language will lose its power if it becomes too widely known. Yet words come and go as they please, like mood and temper traded by friends, explained by lovers, and hurled across the fray. Every Gypsy who “gives away” the Romani language risks the accusation of treason.In the old Romany tradition, you can only call yourself a true Romany Gypsy – one of the kaulo ratti, the black blood – if all your ancestors, as far as you know, are of the tribe. I can trace my Romany ancestry back at least six generations I was brought up to know the Romani language to learn the old tales and to keep the Romanipen – the cleanliness taboos of the old-fashioned Gypsies. I was raised, and still live, in a Romany psychological realm a mental Gypsyland.I have both Gypsy and non-Gypsy blood and so, in many Travellers’ eyes, I do not have the right to call myself a true-bred Romany. It does not matter that there is no such thing as a racially pure Gypsy: over a 1,000-year migration it is virtually impossible that there will have been no mingling in the line. The mixing in my family had happened within living memory, and this meant I was at best a poshrat – a mixed-blood Gypsy – and at worst a “half-chat gorjie” or, as a friend once memorably put it, a “fucked-up half-breed”.I do not look like most people’s idea of a typical Gypsy, my blue eyes and fair hair belying my origins, my picture of myself. My identity was inside me and the outside didn’t match up. It imbued me with a tetchy defensiveness, and a resentment of people whom I then believed had simpler ethnicities: Scottish, Nigerian, Han.I felt so close to my roots, and especially to the Romany women who had brought me up – my mum her mother, Gran and Gran’s mother, Nan. But this seemed to count for little in a world which, for all its modernity, still believed in labels such as “half-caste”, “full-blood” and “mixed race”. Later, as a teenager, I started carrying photographs of darker-haired family members in my wallet, to challenge the disbelief of those who thought I was lying about my Romany background. I lived in a world that wasn’t sure if I really belonged in it, and so I wasn’t sure, either. Regardless, it was where I was. Our family were the mistrusted local Gypsies, the bane of the decent, upstanding parish council. We were “gyppos”, “pikeys”, “diddakois”, “them lot”. Locally, we were infamous. The ide was crystal clear.Compared with the insults and slurs, the words Romanies, Gypsies, and Travellers were dignified, and we used all of them interchangeably. The greater part of our family owned their own yards and bungalows, but the name Travellers still seemed to make sense. There were wheels everywhere, and we were always on hair-trigger alert to hook up trailers and go when the need arose: we drove miles for a living, and had family who lived on the road. Some places with links to the Travellers were not easily romanticised. The sides of the M1, the A1, the A303 and the M25 are peppered with modern-day atchin tans. They are sites with access to opportunities to earn money, and – being less desirable to non-Gypsies – also the sorts of locales where less cash is needed to set up a camp.Such places symbolise the misunderstood truth of many Traveller lives, which is that they are neither permanently nomadic, nor ever truly static. Howbeit, these yards provide a base, the highway is right beside them, ready for the times when family ties, work, a wedding, a funeral, the fair season, beckon. Councils refer to them as “sites close to the key regional transport corridors, favoured by Gypsies and Travellers”. Travellers call them :“Handy, being right by that main road”. Handy, yes, but still handcuffed to tragedy. Every family is haunted by stories of relatives, too often toddlers, who have been knocked down and killed by their literal closeness to roads.The word “Gypsy” wasn’t often heard back when I was a teenager. When it was, it was usually as part of a story about the old days, where someone had shouted out, “Dirty Gypsies!” and nine times out of 10 a fight had ensued, which the dirty Gypsies – who, in my grandad’s words, were “rough, tough and made out of the right stuff” – almost always won.In our world, arguments are often resolved by somebody leaving and the relationship being severed. If this doesn’t happen, then there will almost always be a fight. In the best-case scenario, it’ll just be a fair fist fight, nice and clean, one-on-one, with a referee to see fair play and as few spectators as possible to get sucked into the row. It can be between two men or two women: it’s usually men, but not always. These things are often organised quickly in a place right out of the way, so the law is unlikely to be an issue plus, some police officers I’ve spoken to even seem to have a laissez-faire stance on it, possibly because they have seen worse ways of ending a row than a bare-knuckle fight. Worst-case scenario, it will not be clean and it will not be fair, and the more people that get involved, the more likely that is. If weapons come into it, then the police are especially likely to show an interest.The proceedings of the Old Bailey from 1674-1913 are speckled with references to London’s Gypsies and Travellers. There is a website that explains why they were “over-represented in the proceedings”: they formed part of “what many contemporaries considered a dangerous and crime-prone “residuum”’, which seeped back into the city at autumn following the end of the temporary farm work. It goes on, telling how “in a working-class mirror to the elite’s “London Season”, October and November saw hundreds and thousands of men, women and children returning to the capital from hop-picking and market gardening, from touring the fairs and tramping in search of work”. It was a yearly migration from the city to the countryside and back that continued, for some, right up to the 1950s.For all its flighty connotations, Gypsy culture can be stifling in its demands for living in line with its hidden rules. Rock stars employ “Gypsy” to mean those who have escaped from moral claustrophobia, but in reality, Gypsies are just as likely to feel confined as anybody else. In Glasgow, I watched as a troupe of little girls from the local Roma community danced in brightly coloured dresses at a community event. They clicked their fingers on outstretched arms and sang “Ja tuke tuke” to a furious klezmer beat. The audience clapped and twirled, unaware of the lyrics’ meaning: “Get away from me.”Nan talks of the old paradox that we have heard about all of our lives. The hardship of old times, versus the sense of togetherness that Travellers have lost. The gratitude for comforts that not long ago were undreamed of and unheard of, set against the moral corruption, unhappiness and constant malaise that have come from an overfast integration into the gorjies’ consumerist world.For centuries, politicians had guessed that if Gypsies could be settled in regular housing, then within a few short generations they would be just like everyone else. There would be no need for a word for outsiders, because we would be just like them. But that isn’t what has happened. Many Gypsies now live either in housing, or on permanent caravan sites, not in meadows or lanes or lay-bys or by the sides of old tips. And yet they are still what they are, changed in some ways, but different enough to draw the old line between themselves and the gorjies.I sometimes wonder what Nan thinks I am. Of course, I am her great-grandson, born from her line, flesh and blood. But I’m not what she calls a “true Traveller”. Aside from my mixed roots, I wasn’t born to that life: I arrived into a changed era, one of stability, stasis, hot running water, and Christmases stacked with teetering piles of presents. The Romany bloodline never dies out. But the life of the Traveller changes, sometimes so much so that you could forgive the outside world for thinking the people themselves have vanished.When I was small, Horsmonden in Kent was a typical Travellers’ horse fair. This meant that most people weren’t actually there for the horses. It’s true that a core of those who came, mostly men but quite a few women as well, were proper horse people. They came towing their boxes with strong cobs standing inside, tethered in the half-light their two-wheeled sulkies – light trotting carts with a seat big enough for one or two people – and their harness, head collars and whips. But people came from far and near to the fair, and most of them weren’t interested in any equine displays. If they were, then it was simply because they provided an authentic backdrop. What they were interested in depended on the inidual: but mostly, they were interested in each other. It is a quirk of our scatteredness: a few hundred thousand people at most, flecked across Britain’s damp islands, and we meet mostly at weddings, funerals and fairs. The horse trade has its ups and downs – as I write this, it’s down, the worst in my lifetime. But the horse fairs will persist, because their purpose goes beyond trade.When the days are hot and tanned skins gleam with sweat in the sun, it is clear once again that horse fairs are shop windows for young brides and husbands. They always have been. This much, at least, is gospel, and proudly announced to journalists and inquisitive souls who come asking questions about the culture. But not every dalliance ends in a marriage, and rumours occasionally flare of unauthorised, ultra-brief flings at the fringes of fairs: dangerous liaisons that lead to bad names, fights, or worse, feuds that run on and on.For the not so young, what they seek from each other is something subtler, less clear to outsiders, but an equally powerful draw. I suspect few would want to explain what it was, for fear of sapping its power by giving it voice. What the fairs offer is a chance to track the progress of our lives: to reminisce about previous years when we trod the same field, but equally to remark on how far we have come.We polish and dress up our lives for the day and compare them to the lives of others, affirming their context, confirming their meaning. The fairs are where we remind ourselves who we are. It’s not that we don’t keep being who we are in between – of course we do. But the fairs provide a special concentration of Traveller experience, a tincture of what it is to be a Gypsy. At a horse fair we get to see, just for one day, what life would be like if the world shared our Gypsy priorities.And then there are those who despise both horses and the fairs. For some families, the horse had its day a long time ago. I once asked my mate Charles if he and his family used to go to the fairs up north, which is where he comes from. He looked at me as though the question was perverse. “We don’t mind a day at the races, but Damian, can you see me or me dad, or any of us here, fucking about with horses? My great-great-grandad was a proper Gypsy man, and he was driving a Rolls-Royce a hundred year ago.”Traveller culture, preoccupied though it can be with bygone times, has always preferred the tangible: today’s bread, the here and the now. As Nan says, “You can only eat one meal at a time.” In the past, writers took this as evidence that Gypsies inhabited a “heroic present”, lacking a sense of history and living so sharply in the moment that concepts such as deferred gratification were lost on them. I have always dismissed such ideas as inherently dangerous: they are liable to slide into essentialism, and the belief that races have irreconcilable differences. But maybe in turning so sharply away from a lie, I lost sight of a truth: that the present holds a finer promise than the past with its shadows and dust. In an inversion of the obvious, perhaps even the Traveller obsession with cemetery maintenance itself supports this view. After all, isn’t the act of placing flowers on a tomb a gesture of bringing a little life back to the dead?After the fair at Horsmonden, I largely avoided gatherings of people, spending time in empty stopping places, visiting forlorn churches and well-kept graves. It is dawning on me that there is only so much I can learn from this. Another of Nan’s catchphrases comes to me: “There are no pockets in shrouds.” Perhaps this saying, a caution against overzealous pursuit of riches, masks a second meaning as well. There is a poverty to death a limit to how much a skeleton can teach you about a life it no longer knows.I realised how sparsely furnished my van was. Its naked pale blue surfaces stared at me like sheets of ice. For eight months, I had been travelling with what I thought were the bare essentials – bed, stove, wash gear, clothes and so forth. But there were other trappings of Romany life, when it was lived most richly: beautiful furnishings, gilded surfaces, portable pictures, talismans and silks. I’ve been missing a trick: the means by which a difficult life was rendered livable and even, at times, enviable.When I asked Mum for help, she looked happy, as if pleased that I’d finally grasped the meaning of life. She gave me armfuls of folded materials. There was an Islamic purple velvet hanging, edged with golden stitching and arranged in a pattern of teardrops matching Bedouin horse-cloths, constructed out of navy blue and orange-coloured diamond shapes of fabric brightly coloured Indian tapestry cloths: two square ones, and one in the shape of an arch. They shouted in bright yellows and blues and greens and pinks, with tiny mirrors stitched into them alongside little embroidered birds, stars, flowers, chakra wheels and Hindu swastikas. I decorated the van, clipping the cloths to the plywood lining with bulldog clips and larger, stronger, rubber-tipped market grips.The van was completely transformed. Its contents came together into a nomadic aesthetic all of its own ramshackle, yet somehow making happy sense as a whole. My gran and grandad – Mum’s parents – wandered over to see what I’d been doing. They seemed stunned, but in a good way: “Looks like an old vardo,” Grandad said, using the Traveller word for caravan. Gran remarked that the way I had hung the cloths reminded her of the inside of the Travellers’ square tents back when she was a little girl. Their approval came as a relief. I slammed the doors and smiled as I thought of the road ahead.• Follow the long read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.This is an edited extract from The Stopping Places by Damian Le Bas, published by Chatto \u0026amp Windus on 7 June.

It will spend £500,000 on billboards and newspaper advertising in areas such as Stoke, Carlisle, and towns and cities in the east Midlands.The manifesto expresses the hope that any second referendum campaign would be subject to “stringent policing” and conducted in a different tone to the last, saying both sides should respect voters rather than adopt messages ranging from Project Fear to “false claims” that the NHS would be able to spend £350m a week extra once the UK had left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dcf3e60fc8ca5e6f470be9a7061cc175021f50e/0_106_4303_2582/master/4303.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb2b314550564328daa1c084a5c108b8","title":"michel barnier rejects may uk wide brexit backstop plan","story":"EU negotiator says temporary arrangement to avoid hard Irish border ‘does not work’The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has rejected the suggestion that the whole of the UK could temporarily stay in the customs union and elements of the single market to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.“Backstop means backstop,” Barnier told reporters in Brussels, as he also insisted that the demand by David Davis, the Brexit secretary, for a time limit on the solution would not work.The backstop solution at the heart of the Brexit talks is due to snap into place to avoid a hard Irish border should an adequate free trade deal or technological answer not be in place by the end of the transition period at the end of 2020.Barnier did not rule out a deal on continued membership of the customs union. However, he insisted the offer made over Northern Ireland in March to avoid a hard border in Ireland was “exceptional”, and that he would not countenance the UK somehow attaining “à la carte” single market membership. The UK is yet to suggest what elements of the single market it would stay aligned to.“Our backstop cannot be extended to the whole of the UK,” Barnier said. Barnier later attempted to clarify his remarks, tweeting that they did not represent a wholesale rejection of the backstop. In response to Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who suggested in leaked comments that a “meltdown” in the talks was coming, and that the UK could benefit from the assertive negotiating style of Donald Trump, Barnier said: “I always listen very attentively to what he says and it is always very stimulating. “But I am not going to comment on that ... In reply to Boris Johnson, we are drawing up our position taking full account of the British red lines. Those that Boris Johnson and his colleagues have set out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ec04cddf583f6140ced036e34c71c1692e93c28/0_76_3338_2003/master/3338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c94e9c81c955aa6c828a1df293a7822d","title":"the upside of chronic anxiety being good in emergencies","story":"‘In dramatic situations, I’ve felt like a regulation hero, but really I’m just a highly anxious person who thrives in a crisis’ “I can’t feel anything!” the woman wailed. A taxi driver making a left turn on a snowy Thursday night had plowed into her, and then, realizing what he’d done, reversed, running over her legs a second time. “Is it my knees?” she asked as I crouched beside her. “I just got a double knee replacement. Please don’t say it’s my knees.” I told her I wasn’t sure, but the alignment of the taxi’s tires suggested they’d been crushed. I asked her name and told her mine, held her hand and draped my coat over her upper body. I learned she lived just a block away with her husband, but he wasn’t answering the phone. So I sprinted, slipped past the doorman and, when he opened their apartment door, said, “Everything is OK, but your wife was hit by a taxi. Grab your coat and come with me.” We made it back just in time he clambered into the ambulance behind her.I felt like a regulation hero, but really I’m just a highly anxious person who thrives in a crisis. Years ago, I got a diagnosis (generalized anxiety disorder) and some affirmation of how bad it is. (Doctor: “I’m impressed by how highly functioning you are, considering.”) For a long time, I didn’t think dealing with chronic anxiety and being good in emergencies were linked. It actually seems like the opposite would be true. But then, in 2016, I read the essay collection So Sad Today and came across a quote that forced me out of bed to get a pen. “For someone with anxiety, dramatic situations are, in a way, more comfortable than the mundane,” Melissa Broder wrote. “In dramatic situations, the world rises to meet your anxiety.” I underlined the passage, added a star in the margin and dog-eared the page for good measure.A few years before, dealing with a particularly severe bout of anxiety, I had tried cognitive behavioral therapy. It’s less “tell me your first memory of your parents abandoning you” and more “let’s see if we can figure out how your thought patterns are distorted by anxiety”. There were worksheets and homework assignments, new terms to learn and lists to make. Where previously I’d endlessly and obsessively worried about the smallest tests, that summer, I considered CBT the most important test of all. So while I started to recognize how persuasive and pervasive my anxiety is, I also happened to be dealing with said anxiety exactly the way I was used to – by treating it as a means to an end. Unsurprisingly, using anxiety to fuel my treatment of anxiety just resulted in more anxiety.Wisely, my therapist suggested I see a psychiatrist to explore pharmaceutical options. She offered a simile about drowning and said an anti-anxiety drug might help me get my head above water so I could start swimming to shore, AKA making real progress in and outside of her office. It was a compelling visual, but the idea of taking an anti-anxiety medication did not inspire confidence or anything resembling calm. I wasn’t so much worried that the drugs wouldn’t work – I was worried that they would. What if I get this taste of a different life, but then the drugs stop working and for the rest of my life I know how great things could but will never be again? I fretted.But also, to be honest, I was afraid that the drugs would work indefinitely and my anxiety would evaporate. It felt weird to be clinging to a part of me that also drove me to misery on a daily basis. Finally, my therapist asked: “What would happen if you were no longer this anxious?” I hemmed and hawed and then admitted that I saw my anxiety as fuel without it, I might not be as driven. “But what if your anxiety is hurting you, not helping?” she countered. “What if you’re successful in spite of your anxiety, not because of it?” It struck me as a completely absurd idea. “Well, I’d certainly have a lot of free time to think about other things,” I conceded. Riding the subway home, it occurred to me that just as often as it propelled me, anxiety rendered me completely immobile.Soon after, I decided to try taking something for anxiety. A psychiatrist recommended a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which is a type of antidepressant that’s commonly used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. It helped, a lot, especially initially and in combination with therapy. After the SSRI began to work, I thought I might be able to outrun my disorder, that I would someday graduate to being a person who has anxiety sometimes rather than a constantly anxious person.That doesn’t seem to be the case. The SSRI helps me deal with – but doesn’t cure – my anxiety. Sometimes, as I shake one of the tiny white pills out of its orange plastic container, it feels like a lifeline. Other days, I’m not even sure it’s doing much of anything, given how anxious I still am. Honestly, it’s hard to tell, as there are so many factors that influence my anxiety levels, from work to what’s going on in the world to whether I’m doing all the boring #selfcare things that actually help, like going to the dreaded gym.Talking about today’s highly anxiety-inducing climate in a recent set, comedian Aparna Nancherla said: “It’s weird that anxiety is finally on message. Like, if you’re an anxious person, it’s kind of like, ‘Well, this is what we trained for. This is our Olympics.’” As a gold-medal neurotic, I’d definitely qualify, but I don’t think I do much better than most people in dealing with the free-floating the-world-is-probably-ending-any-day-now angst. I mean, I’m still worrying over a History channel special from five years ago about a rogue comet that could wipe out the globe’s electricity, plunging us into a food crisis. And I only watched the commercial.But when it comes to a sudden emergency, I snap to. For fear of sounding like I’m bragging, I’ll just say that I’ve helped a nice number of strangers in awful circumstances. My anxiety is always there, humming in the background, sometimes so present I can’t listen to anything else. It’s a deadweight, one I sometimes wish I could chuck in the Hudson river. But carrying something like that around doesn’t only give you a neck ache, it also gives you a particular type of strength. I think that’s why I knew to crouch down next to the old lady under the taxi, to direct other bystanders to step back and give her space, to speak clearly and kindly. Even if I haven’t been pinned under a 4,000lb taxi, I know the feeling of something pressing down on you like it’ll never let up.Lenny Letter is a newsletter offering unfiltered writing on feminism, style, health, politics and friendship.

How times change, eh? Now Nadal’s sniffing out a bagel as he moves into a 0-30 lead. A brutal smash makes it 15-40 two set points. But Del Potro, such a fighter, grimly fights to deuce. Somehow he holds and, with more than a hint of irony and self-deprecation, thanks the heavens.Second set: Nadal 6-4, 4-0 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Del Potro smashes to save a break point. It feels like the air’s been let out of the ground. Nadal is relentless and Del Potro is toiling, sending another forehand long. Del Potro clings on for a while but Nadal eventually breaks him, spiritually and physically. This is done.Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 3-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): Hang on! At 30-all, Nadal nets a backhand to give Del Potro his seventh break point. But no. You can relax again. Nadal comes up with a storming forehand winner and goes on to consolidate the break.Second set: Nadal 6-4, 2-0 Del Potro* (*denotes server): Uh oh. Nadal swiftly earns three break points. Del Potro nets a forehand. Thanks for playing, Juan Martin.Second set: Nadal* 6-4, 1-0 Del Potro (*denotes server): The challenge for Del Potro is to get over the disappointment of losing that set as quickly as possible. That won’t be easy. Nadal hasn’t made a habit of squandering winning positions and although he’s taken to deuce in this game, he isn’t in danger of being broken.All that pressure from Del Potro and now the big Argentinian’s in trouble after a wonderful flicked backhand from a counterpunching Nadal makes it 0-30. Del Potro responds with a trademark forehand for 15-30 but Nadal’s soon clutching two set points after a spinning forehand winner. Del Potro saves the first. But then he nets a backhand. He’s annoyed. You have to admire Nadal’s sense of timing. It’s utterly ruthless from the Spaniard, who’s been on the ropes for much of the first set.First set: Del Potro 4-5 Nadal* (*denotes server): Del Potro can’t handle the Nadal forehand on the first point and he’s out of position when the Spaniard runs forward to punch a volley away. But Del Potro wins the next point and then he shows sprightly movement to reach a Nadal drop shot and win a battle of wits at the net for 15-30. Then Del Potro kisses the line with a waspish backhand for two break points. This is a huge moment. Nadal, so nerveless, saves the first with a drop shot. There wasn’t much Del Potro could do about that but he looks aghast when he spurns the second break point with a dreadful forehand that sails long and wide for deuce. He has another chance when a Nadal backhand clips the tape and goes wide but this time he frames a forehand and swipes at thin air. Ouch. You can’t keep missing those chances against Nadal, who raps a sharp backhand from right to left before showing deft reflexes at the net to hold. Nadal’s saved six break points in this set but Del Potro will have to serve to keep it alive.First set: Del Potro* 4-4 Nadal (*denotes server): Del Potro is serving with new balls and he wins the first point. Then he rams a backhand down the line for 30-0. Another hold. Del Potro seems to be over that early injury scare.First set: Del Potro 3-4 Nadal* (*denotes server): Nadal glides to a comfortable hold.First set: Del Potro* 2-3 Nadal (*denotes server): The trainer has been and gone. Del Potro trudges on. He decides it’s time for a drop shot. Nadal engages in a dink war but Del Potro has the answers to make it 15-0. The game goes to 40-30. Del Potro holds when Nadal sends a forehand return long.First set: Del Potro 2-3 Nadal* (*denotes server): If Del Potro’s still hurting, he’s hiding it well. He moves into a 0-30 lead on Nadal’s serve again. Nadal fights back, though, making good use of the drop shot to climb to 30-all. A Del Potro error makes it 40-30 and Nadal holds. Del Potro will seek treatment from the trainer now.First set: Del Potro* 2-2 Nadal (*denotes server): Del Potro shot a wry smile at his box and shook his head at the end of the previous game. This is a concern. He’s called for the trainer during the next changeover. On we go for now, though. But Nadal will smell blood and he makes it 0-15 with a forehand winner, Del Potro nowhere near it. That said, Del Potro can be a bit of an actor sometimes. He wins the next two points and when it goes to 30-all, he digs deep and finds some forehand winners to hold.First set: Del Potro 1-2 Nadal* (*denotes server): A punishing rally on the first point ends with Nadal being overpowered and netting a backhand. Nadal’s looking a bit edgy and a wild double-fault at 0-30 hands Del Potro three break points. Nadal saves the first two, though, and then he’s relieved to see Del Potro net a forehand pass on the run. Deuce. Nadal proceeds to wrongfoot Del Potro with a forehand, causing the Argentinian to wince and hold his left hip. Has he stretched something there? Let’s hope not. Nadal holds and Del Potro limps back to his chair.First set: Del Potro* 1-1 Nadal (*denotes server): Wallop! Clobber! There’s the first big forehand from Del Potro. Then comes a lighter touch, a Murray-esque backhand lob for 30-0. He’s mixing it up well. Another huge forehand - registered at 102mph - makes it 40-0. An ace is enough for a comfortable hold.First set: Del Potro 0-1 Nadal* (*denotes server): The second men’s semi-final begins with Rafa Nadal serving. Del Potro never beaten Nadal on clay before. You fancy he needs a good start. He makes an authoritative one, crunching into a 0-30 lead, heaving hitting penetrating Nadal’s defence. Nadal wins the next three points, though, and holds with a Cecchinato-esque drop shot.We’ve had the coin toss. Rafa Nadal will serve first. Here come the players. Big cheers for both men. Juan Martin del Potro, the gentle giant, is such a popular character. And Rafael Nadal ... well, he’s Rafa Nadal.Hello again. Rafael Nadal has won his past 15 grand slam semi-finals, a run that stretches back to the 2009 US Open. His conqueror at Flushing Meadows? A certain Juan Martin del Potro. That said, Nadal absolutely destroyed Del Potro in four sets at last year’s US Open. It’s a hot day in Paris and Nadal looks virtually unbeatable on clay. How can Del Potro, even with that huge forehand, hope to outlast him over five sets?So it’s Nadal v Del Potro next up then. Jacob is back from his lunch break and he’ll guide you through the second men’s semi-final. Bye! So after bowing out at the semi-final stage at Roland Garros in 2016 and 2017, Dominic Thiem reaches his first grand slam final, where he will meet one of Rafa Nadal or Juan Martin del Potro. Remember Thiem is the last person to beat Nadal on clay, when he beat the Spaniard in the quarter-finals of the Madrid Open last month, to end Nadal’s run of 25 matches on clay – a 51-week unbeaten stretch. “I think the big key was the second set because it was a close tie-break. I saved two set points and luckily I won it. It was 6-4 and the one thing I wanted to do was win the set and I missed an easy volley at one moment which was not a nice feeling.”“It’s very important to regenerate, and have a good breakfast tomorrow. I’ll study my opponent, whoever it is, and then full power on Sunday!”Cecchinato heads straight off court to rapturous applause. What a brilliant tournament he’s had, he should move up towards the top 20 with what he’s done here, 27th is what some people are saying. The Italian has been a pleasure to watch, particularly those drop shots. Will be interesting to see how he adapts his game on grass. I suspect he has the game to do well, if he can keep this confidence high. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 1-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): You know what I said about Thiem’s backhand not being that graceful? I take it back, he’s ripped a gorgeous inside-out shot right into the far left corner. Postage-stamp stuff. That said, Thiem is 15-30 down, and an error gives Cecchinato two break points! Signs of life! Thiem saves the first with relentless hitting from one side to the other, then wins the other with Cecchinato so tired from the previous point that he can just return a second serve into the net. At deuce, you sense that’s Cecchinato’s final chance gone. Thiem makes no mistake, picking up a cheap point to go to match point and then again battering an exhausted Cecchinato from side to side before a simple forehand winner. Thiem wins! Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 1-5 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato is on the board in this third set. But there is only muted applause. Thiem looked as though he was saving his energy for the next service game, batting a backhand into the tramlines to give the Italian some respite.Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem makes his first mistake in 10 points with a loose forehand. 15-30 down, he then rips a huge serve down the T for an ace. Cecchinato does well to come to the net and set up a smash, but he can only cannon it into the net. The Italian’s face is expressionless, his previously animated supporters silent in the stands. One final error from Cecchinato gives Thiem his fifth straight game. However, Cecchinato has fallen apart here, it’s been impressive the professional way Thiem has picked him off, hitting winners when he needed to, as well as percentage shots to let Cecchinato make his own mistakes. Tactically very astute, this. Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 0-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Cecchinato’s legs are gone, and he’s now playing ambitious would-be winners, but with his feet in a lazy position. The footwork just isn’t there. One shot goes wide, the other into the net. Four straight points for Thiem, and the Austrian breaks to love. This match looks over. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem wins the game to love. It’s a radically different game to the one we enjoyed at the end of the second set. Cecchinato may have the more graceful one-handed backhand – Gasquet-esque – but Thiem’s is flatter and more powerful. Cecchinato doesn’t look like he can handle the power – he’s mentally flat – and can only watch as Thiem floats a beautiful lob on the gallop just inside the baseline to close out the game. Third set: Cecchinato* 5-7, 6-7, 0-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem races into a 3-0 lead and has a half-chance to break, but two sloppy errors lets the Italian back into the game. It goes to deuce with Cecchinato failing with an ill-advised drop shot that finds the net. Another poor slice gives break point to Thiem, and the Austrian makes no mistake! Thiem breaks at the first time of asking with the cutest of drop shots. Cecchinato in real danger of falling away here. Third set: Cecchinato 5-7, 6-7, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Cecchinato somehow survives at the net, two sublime defensive volleys keep him in the rally, before Thiem inexplicably hits one wide down the line. At 15-30 down, Cecchinato has his first point, before Thiem powers down two unreturned serves to close out the first game of the third set. Hello everyone. What a tie-break that was. Sitters were missed, drop-shots were, er, dropped, and nerves were frayed. Cecchinato showed great mental strength against Djokovic, but he may be in too deep here. He’s got to win the next three sets to make the French Open final. Let’s see if he can do it – Thiem to serve first.I’m going to get some lunch before Nadal v Del Potro. Michael Butler will guide you through the third set.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 10-12 Thiem* (*denotes server): This is Thiem’s fifth set point. It’s the third he’s had on his serve. This, you feel, is surely it. Cecchinato isn’t going to give up without a fight - but Thiem sinks to his knees when he sees a forehand pass from the Italian fly long!Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 10-11 Thiem (*denotes server): A fine return from Thiem forces Cecchinato to dribble a forehand into the net!Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 10-10 Thiem (*denotes server): After a grinding baseline rally, it’s Thiem’s turn to produce a spinning backhand drop shot and get himself out of a deep hole!

He’s two points from a two-set lead.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 2-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem smashes to good effect.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 2-3 Thiem (*denotes server): A long rally ends with Thiem battering a monstrous forehand away.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato* 2-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Another drop shot from Cecchinato.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 1-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem hooks a forehand from right to left.Second set tie-break: Cecchinato 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): A magnificent, angled return puts Cecchinato in control of the rally, though he’s in danger of blowing it when he fails to put away a couple of smashes.

Patrick Marber’s After Miss Julie relocated the action to the night of Labour’s election victory in 1945. Yaël Farber’s Mies Julie set the story in a post-apartheid South Africa still simmering with racial and class tensions. Both these versions gave the play a strong political context signally lacking in Stenham’s version, which, although well acted – not least by The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby – doesn’t make total sense. In Strindberg’s 1888 original, a count’s daughter fatally seduces her father’s valet. In Stenham’s version we are in modern London, where Julie, the 33-year-old daughter of a rich tycoon, is having a wild birthday bash in her dad’s townhouse. Down in the kitchen her father’s black chauffeur, Jean, who has been deputed to keep an eye on proceedings, passes the time with his Brazilian fiancee, Kristina. The coke-snorting Julie, in turmoil after a breakup with her partner, comes downstairs and demands a dance with Jean that, as in Strindberg, has disastrous results. Strindberg set the play in a world of rigid class distinctions for which Stenham finds no exact equivalent: if today a fat cat’s daughter had sex with a chauffeur, it might lead to chit-chat on social media but would hardly provoke the participants into dreaming of taking flight. Stenham’s solution is to substitute money for class: the gulf between Julie and Jean is here financial. But, although the published version tells us that the play’s two servants are “first-generation economic or political immigrants”, the text itself gives us scant information about their backgrounds. You wonder why Jean would want to run off with an employer who insultingly tells him that “You’re sticking the maid”. Stenham’s answer is to hint that Jean wants to get his hands on Julie’s wealth, but that merely turns him into a cynical opportunist. Put simply, the crisis in Stenham’s version seems disproportionate to the events. Carrie Cracknell’s production and Tom Scutt’s design are similarly overblown. Whatever his misogyny, one of Strindberg’s insights was to realise that his play demanded “a small stage and a small auditorium”. Here the play has to occupy a big theatre. This leads to awkward transitions from the upstairs party to the downstairs kitchen, where the characters confront each other across a space like the Grand Canyon. The party itself looks over-choreographed rather than spontaneous, and the production makes excessive use of that ominous background hum that, ever since Ivo van Hove’s A View from the Bridge, has become a staple feature of cutting-edge productions. Fortunately, the acting is good. Kirby catches perfectly the idea of Julie as a damaged, overgrown child torn between total dependence on others and suspicion that she is seen as a moneybox anyone can shake and rattle. Kirby manages to make her both vindictive and helpless, and when she asks “Am I insane?” it is with genuine pathos. Eric Kofi Abrefa is not helped by Jean’s lack of a backstory but conveys the character’s mix of attraction and repulsion towards the unstable Julie, and Thalissa Teixeira lends Kristina an unusual sexual vibrancy. These actors do sterling work but in Stenham’s version I never felt that the tragic outcome was dictated by an inexorable dramatic force.•Julie is at the Lyttelton at the National Theatre, London, until 8 September.

Once there, find the home of a striking new exhibition dedicated to 007, built into the peak overlooking the Austrian Alps in a structure resembling a Bond villain’s lair.Due to open on July 12, 007 Elements is an immersive attraction that places visitors inside the world of one of cinema’s favourite action heroes, celebrating the work of Bond set designer Sir Ken Adams and behind-the-scenes footage from the films. Also on display are film props and interactive exhibits that “that places visitors inside the world of 007”.The Gaislachkogl ski resort in Sölden was one of the locations for Spectre, the 24th Bond film released in 2015, which featured an impressive chase scene shot over five weeks on the mountain, featuring an aircraft and a fleet of Range Rovers.Filming also took place at the futuristic Ice-Q restaurant, which became the Hoffler Klinik in the film, which is next to the new installation. Austrian architect Johann Obermoser – who designed Ice-Q and also the cable car station that takes visitors to the summit – took inspiration from Bond villain lairs when designing the exhibition space, a stark, contemporary structure built into the mountaintop. Only the entrance, exit, two windows and a viewing plaza are visible from the outside. Speaking to Architectural Digest, Obermoser described the challenges of building at altitude: “The permafrost at this elevation, the geological fault lines, and the exposed location on the peak created huge challenges during the build,” he said.“The snowfall prevented us from getting vehicles to the site, so we ended up having to fly the concrete in by helicopter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1777dd2120581e495001411bf4033db14e17e1be/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5b522f0f8558022f5929010e5a026ea","title":"cynthia nixon new york governor","story":"Fueled by small donors, the Sex and the City star spells out her challenge to Andrew Cuomo and the Democratic establishmentby  Ed Pilkington in BuffaloCynthia Nixon will not make the same mistake twice. As the former Sex and the City star arrived for a campaign event in Buffalo, New York this week she was greeted by a phalanx of placard-wielding supporters of her opponent, the incumbent governor of the state, Andrew Cuomo.“Cynthia go home,” one poster said, which was a bit rough given the almost 400-mile journey she’d just made from her home in New York City. “This is upstate – nice of you to find it,” said a snarky second. Another said: “Next stop Ithica.”“Very unfortunate,” Nixon conceded as she was quizzed about the gaffe at the event in Buffalo. And for good measure she correctly enunciated every letter: “B.U.F.F.A.L.O.”Hiccups are perhaps only to be expected for a first-time candidate who cut her teeth on the stage, found fame through the small screen and has never before run for elected office. But what is most surprising about Cynthia Nixon’s audacious attempt to unseat Cuomo from the governorship he has occupied for the past eight years is how surefooted it feels.Nixon is positioning herself boldly as the true progressive voice for New York. She calls her campaign a “people-powered insurgency”, fueled by small donors in contrast to Cuomo’s top-down bid for re-election with its $30m war chest, and her rhetoric is as targeted as much against the machine politics of New York’s dominant Democratic party as it is against Donald Trump. She has cut his polling lead from 47 points in March to 22 last month.“We have a governor here in Andrew Cuomo who is not a progressive and is barely a Democrat,” Nixon told the  in Buffalo, New York state’s second largest city. “If he wanted true progressive change he would have done it already – you can’t just play progressive in the months leading up to an election.”If this sounds familiar, it is: Nixon channels more than a little of Bernie Sanders. As a framing for the Nixon versus Cuomo battle, think Sanders versus Hillary Clinton – the radical outlier versus the establishment favourite. She puts it another way: David versus Goliath.Unlike Sanders, who ran before Trump was ascendant, Nixon has the benefit of the post-Trump bounce that is lifting her up as part of a nationwide resistance. “With Donald Trump in the White House we are going in completely the wrong direction,” she told the . “This is a terrible moment for our country, but it is also an opportunity: we are incentivized as never before in my lifetime to make progressive change.”As a further boost, she sees her campaign as part of a related nationwide surge of radical female candidates who are shaking up the Democratic party – most recently in the figure of Stacey Abrams who is vying in Georgia to become America’s first black female governor. “Trump has been a wake-up call for women all across the country who believe, as I believe, that if we want change we have to go out and make it happen ourselves by running for office,” Nixon said.One of the interesting aspects of Nixon’s bid to become New York’s first female governor is her relationship to her own celebrity. She studiously avoids all reference to it – you will hear no mention of SATC in her campaign literature or in her stump speeches.But being a household name is an undeniable advantage in modern politics – not every rookie candidate is given a platform on The Daily Show or endorsed by the Nation – and though she doesn’t labour the point, nor does she run from it. When the  caught up with her at a campaign stop on the New York City subway, where she was berating Cuomo for the diabolical state of mass transit in the metropolis over which he presides, she smiled broadly and shook the hands of passengers who were palpably star-struck in her presence.“I love you!” several riders said, stopping to take selfies with her. But an equal number were complimentary not towards Nixon as Miranda but towards Nixon as would-be governor. “I really like what you’re saying about the subway,” a male passenger said. “I’m a teacher and I’m really appreciative of what you’re trying to do for us,” a woman said.That delicate balance of making the most of her fame without playing to it is more complicated in upstate New York, where voters have a more skeptical approach towards stardom. Though they share the same identity as New Yorkers, the 9 million residents of New York City and the 11 million residents of the rest of the state are in some ways chalk and cheese: voters in economically struggling upstate and western regions of New York state view the city dwellers as “flatlanders” and can scoff at their fashion trends and perceived glamour.“That show, it did a lot to harm family values in this country,” said a man in Buffalo who asked not to be named, referring to Sex and the City.As Nixon builds her campaign ahead of the Democratic primary election against Cuomo in September she is counting on the likelihood that most voters who bother to turn up – whether in the city or in upstate communities like Buffalo – will be committed progressives who will be receptive to her left-leaning pitch. And she believes that her long record of voluntary work, especially as an advocate for public schools, will speak louder than any of Cuomo’s attacks on her for being unqualified or lightweight.“Cynthia is a very down-to-earth, accessible person who really understands people. She connects to people, then links that to policy and what needs to happen,” said Billy Easton, who worked closely with her at the Alliance for Quality Education where he is executive director.In Buffalo she certainly talked the liberal talk as she addressed an art gallery full of activists. During two hours of discussion with about 50 local people she ticked off all the subjects dearest to American progressives’ hearts. As governor she would: address racial and economic inequality and empower people in their communities increase taxes on the super-wealthy to pay for it decriminalize marijuana possession as one of many steps towards emptying out prisons extend rights for undocumented immigrants increase protections for LGBTQ people invest in public education toughen rent laws and combat gentrification fight corruption and end the overweening influence of corporate money in politics.The list may verge on the predictable, but long before she gets to the polling stations it is already having an impact. A discernible pattern has emerged – dubbed the “Cynthia effect” by pundits – whereby she proposes a new leftist policy one day and Cuomo responds with his own version of it the next. You see that with marijuana, where the sitting governor resolutely opposed legalisation until Nixon launched her campaign and then within weeks switched to supporting it. He passively accommodated the bizarre situation whereby seven Democratic state senators side with the Republicans, maintaining a conservative grip on state government, until Nixon declared her run – and then he moved swiftly to reunite the party. He opposed giving the right to vote to 40,000 people with criminal convictions, then did a U-turn once Nixon was in the race.Cuomo’s kneejerk reactions to Nixon’s goading should not be confused with political weakness – the wily and cunning incumbent is very far from conceding defeat. But the responses do suggest signs that we now have game on.And as Nixon stresses, she’s not in this contest just for the “Cynthia effect”. She’s here for one reason alone: “I’m in this to win.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/738cfcbc1e7a7e8763e738e7d09c5b82f342d98a/0_303_5471_3282/master/5471.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a1afc4b9e0cc4c613d07da16af3c76b","title":"priest finds 36000 stashed confessional box rome church","story":"Police suspect money either left by generous benefactor or someone regretting illicit gainsRome police and clergy at a church near the Vatican have been left baffled after a package containing €36,000 (£31,500) was found in a confessional box.Police were called to Santa Maria delle Grazie alle Fornaci on Wednesday to investigate what priests originally feared might have been a bomb. They instead found wads of €50 notes hidden beneath the priest’s chair in the confessional box.Police suspect the money may have been left by a generous benefactor or someone repentant after acquiring the cash through illicit means.“At the moment we are not excluding any hypothesis,” Salvatore Friano, the police officer leading the investigation, told Il Messaggero.“It cannot be ruled out that the money might have been illicitly acquired, maybe as a result of a recent theft or robbery in the city.”The package was found by Father Giovanni Martire Savina. “Until a few years ago every now and then someone would leave substantial monetary offers, even €1,000, but never this much,” he said.“Certainly, such a sum would be useful for the church, but not to the detriment of someone else.”The discovery prompted curious worshippers to flock to the church, with one telling Il Messaggero that “it’s important to go to confession”.Churchgoing has declined in Italy over the last decade or so, as has the number of those seeking absolution, although Catholicism still holds considerable sway over the population."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8e412cbcb14b5f21328b0adc1fd4e9cda2ff025/200_0_2477_1486/master/2477.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9798e493b0940d2bddcfdc336d2a6d71","title":"turkey austria close mosques expel imams","story":"Austrian chancellor says country can no longer put up with ‘parallel societies’As many as 60 Turkish imams and their families face expulsion from Austria and seven mosques are due to be closed under a clampdown on what the government has called “political Islam”.Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said the country could no longer put up with “parallel societies, political Islam and radicalisation,” which he said had “no place in our country”.The announcement at a press conference by leading members of the coalition government, which comprises the centre-right People’s party (ÖVP) and the far-right Freedom party (FPÖ), prompted a furious reaction from Ankara, which called the move anti-Islamic.“Austria’s decision to shut down numerous mosques and deport imams with a lame excuse is a reflection of the anti-Islam, racist and discriminatory populist wave in this country,” tweeted İbrahim Kalin, a spokesman for the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Austria’s interior minister, Herbert Kickl, of the FPÖ, said around 150 people faced losing their right to residency, taking into account the imams’ family members.The moves follow an investigation by the national religious affairs authority into activities carried out by mosques in Austria. Images of children in a Turkish-financed mosque re-enacting the first world war battle of Gallipoli have dominated headlines in Austria for weeks, and intensified a nationwide debate over what is widely viewed as the insufficient integration of people of Turkish origin in Austrian society.The photographs, published in April, showed some of the boys playing dead and being draped in Turkish flags – seeming to identify more with Turkey than with Austria – at what was reportedly an official event organised by the Turkish-Islamic Cultural Association (ATIB). The ATIB condemned the images, calling the event “extremely regrettable”, but insisting that it had called it off.Relations between Austria and Turkey have long been strained, with Kurz insistent to the European Union since he entered office last year that it should cease negotiations about Ankara joining the bloc.At the press conference on Friday, Kurz, Kickl, the vice-chancellor, Christian Strache, and the culture minister, Gernot Blümel, said the country had an obligation to be “watchful” of political Islam. The initiative is part of the so-called Islam law, which was brought in under the previous government, in which Kurz was a minister.Among the mosques facing closure is the Mosque of the Grey Wolves on Antonsplatz, in the working-class Vienna district of Favoriten, where the Gallipoli reenactment took place. The Grey Wolves are widely considered to be a far-right ultranationalist group. The other six mosques are in Vienna, Upper Austria and Carinthia, in all of which hardline salafist teachings are said to be widespread. The imams facing expulsion all stand accused of receiving funding from abroad. Official investigations have been launched in 11 cases. Two of the imams had already been denied extensions to their residency permits.Blümel stressed that the clampdown was not anti-Islam, insisting that “it is not a contradiction to be both a practicing Muslim and a proud Austrian”.ATIB, which is the umbrella organisation for 60 associations with more than 100,000 members, said it made no secret of the fact that it funded imams in Austria. “This happens not because we want it to, but because there is no adequate training offered for imams in Austria,” Yasar Ersoy, its spokesman, told Austrian radio.Thomas Schmidinger, a political scientist, said he doubted whether outlawing outsider funding for Austria-based imams would have the effect of reining them in. “I think it’s far more likely to be the case that ATIB will feel marginalised and will try to find alternative, albeit illegal ways to finance imams,” he told Austrian media.He said extremist groups such as the Grey Wolves were likely to be driven underground, making it far harder for authorities to monitor them. He also said it was unfortunate the government had launched its clampdown in the middle of a Turkish election campaign, calling it “water on the wheels of the far right”.During last year’s Turkish referendum on expanding the president’s powers, tensions ran high between Vienna and Ankara after Austria said it would not allow campaign-related events. Relations were also strained by Kurz’s staunch opposition to Turkey’s bid to join the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf256d2dc08f8e66e40aef821c611ba01311e15c/747_380_1674_1005/master/1674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92f9fa71761c6e4ba1b0404f930cdd01","title":"vatican document hints at new debate over married clergy","story":"Bishops urged to consider how to broaden church’s reach in the AmazonThe Vatican has subtly suggested it is open to a new debate on whether married men and women can serve in official ministries, after it called on Catholic bishops who are working in the Amazon to think “courageously” about how to broaden the church’s reach in the region.A document published on Friday ahead of a 2019 special synod does not explicitly raise the issue of married men serving as clergy but says Catholic bishops need to think of new ways to allow the faithful to access the Eucharist, and acknowledges that the church is spread “precariously thin” in the region. It also calls on bishops to consider the role of women in the Amazon, and what ministerial roles they might play, “taking into account the central role women play today in the Amazonian church”.Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri said at a press conference to discuss the document that the church was not making an “official declaration” about the role of married men and women serving in ministries, but he suggested there was room for debate.“Here we speak of ministry – there are lots of various forms of ministry,” he said. “Let’s leave freedom to the discussion. We are not trying to preclude anything.”Baldisseri, the general secretary of the synod of bishops, quoted previous remarks by Pope Francis that the church needed to “allow space for women in the church at all levels” while still confining itself to official doctrine, which bars women and married men from serving as priests.Some Vatican watchers have interpreted the language of the 14-page document as possibly raising the prospect that the church might allow married men and women to serve in new roles, at least in the Amazon.The Vatican has called for the meeting in part so that bishops can think of new ways to create a church “with an Amazonian face and a church with a native face”, the document says.At the same time, it emphasises the “cry of thousands” who have been deprived of the Sunday Eucharist because of the church’s challenges in the region.The preparatory document also focuses on environmental and cultural issues in the Amazon, as well as the church’s history of colonialism there."},{"url":null,"title":"dramatic near misses at level crossings caught on cctv","story":"  June 7, 2018Rail operators call for vigilance on International Level Crossing Safety Awareness Day "},{"url":null,"title":"magdalene woman we were slaves to the nuns and the church but no more","story":"  June 5, 2018First time for many to speak freely to other women incarcerated in the laundries   June 5, 2018When I first met her she doubted justice would ever come her way-not from the Good Shepherd Sisters and not from the Irish State   June 5, 2018President apologises at \u0026Aacuteras reception to women who worked in laundries   June 5, 2018Banquet held in Dublin\u0026rsquos Mansion House for some 230 people incarcerated in laundries "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523217.1528410960!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain to insist on a deal by october on an open border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit minister David Davis (right), with international trade secretary Liam Fox outside 10 Downing Street on Thursday.

The UK is clear that the future customs arrangement needs to deliver on the commitments made in relation to Northern Ireland. The UK expects the future arrangement to be in place by the end of December 2021 at the latest. There are a range of options for how a time limit could be delivered, which the UK will propose and discuss with the EU,” it says.Brexiteers fear that the arrangement could mean Britain would remain in the customs union indefinitely, with the EU wielding a veto over when it could leave, but the prime minister’s official spokesperson said the UK would not agree to such an arrangement.“We’re not going to sign up to anything which means that the EU can hold us in a temporary backstop when our customs arrangements are ready. At the point when new customs arrangements that meet our commitments on Northern Ireland are ready, the backstop must end. But we will talk to the EU about that as part of the wider negotiation on this proposal,” the spokesperson said.Downing Street insisted that the new proposal was consistent with the commitment Britain made last March that the backstop would remain in place “unless and until” another solution was found for the Border.“The point of the counterproposal is to make sure that if a customs arrangement with the EU is not in place by the end of the implementation period there won’t be a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and that is fully in tune with what we agreed in March,” the spokesperson said.“We are not looking to implement the backstop. We are confident that our system will be agreed and in place.”The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Simon Coveney, who is on a visit to the Middle East, said he would discuss the proposals with the commission negotiating team in the coming days.He stressed that “substantial progress on the backstop” was needed before the EU summit at the end of this month. “Clearly, a great deal of work remains to be done and this needs to be the highest priority for all sides in the weeks ahead,” he said.In Dublin, official sources said that while the British proposals published on Thursday did not constitute sufficient progress in themselves, they provided a basis to engage with the British, which may lead to achieving progress before the summit.Sources conceded, however, that with only two weeks’ negotiating space left before arrangements to finalise the summit are required, the timetable before the summit is extremely tight. The Irish Government has drawn some encouragement from the fact that the British government was now “engaging” with the issues but believes a fundamental breakthrough is still required in June.One senior Irish Government source said while it was obvious that greater detail was needed from the British before the end of June, it was important to “keep the show on the road”.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

Photograph: Will OliverEPASo what is\u0026nbspthis latest thing to have happened in all this Brexit business?After months of awaiting a British response to the EU’s draft proposal around the “backstop” solution – a default plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland post-Brexit – London has suggested its own version of the plan.Wait, what’s the backstop again?To maintain an invisible border, the EU and UK agreed in a political deal last December that if they had not agreed a trade deal post-Brexit or other specific solution for the Border, then there should be a backstop maintaining regulatory alignment North and South to avoid customs checks.Where does the Government stand on this?Dublin is pushing hard for the backstop because, in the absence of a long-term trade deal (which will take years to negotiate) and an alternative solution (several of which have been suggested by the UK and rejected by the EU), this fall-back solution effectively maintains the status quo on the island of Ireland post-Brexit.Did the UK approve of the EU’s suggested backstop?Even though it agreed in principle to a backstop, London said that it could not agree to the EU’s proposed backstop because alignment would only apply to Northern Ireland and in effect establish a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. This caused alarm among the Democratic Unionist Party whose support is keeping Theresa May and her Conservative Party in power in the House of Commons.So what is\u0026nbspMay’s government proposing now?The UK government has formally proposed the idea a “temporary customs arrangement” in a government paper that would apply to the UK as a whole, keeping the entire country in the EU customs union in the event of a failure to reach a deal on customs arrangements with the EU.This backstop would, crucially for ardent Brexit supporters in May’s government and party, be limited in time. It would continue beyond the proposed Brexit transition period, when EU and UK will remain aligned, from the UK’s formal departure in March 2019 until December 2020. This would maintain frictionless trade between the EU and the UK and eliminate tariffs, quotas and customs processes on all EU-UK trade.So how long would this time-limited backstop last?May’s government has said the time-limited backstop will only apply, should it be needed, until a permanent customs arrangement is introduced and that it “expects” this to be in place by the end of 2021.“Expects”? But what if the permanent plan is not in place by then?That is where things get complicated, not just for the upcoming negotiations around whether the two sides can meet somewhere in the middle in time for a summit of EU leaders at the end of this month.This is not a guaranteed cut-off date and the EU would likely reject that because it is temporary in nature, does not protect the EU single market and customs union, and because Brussels had rejected the idea of allowing the backstop to apply to the UK as a whole. But the fudged position keeps the Brexiteers happy because it ensures that the UK will not have indefinite membership of the EU customs union.Why this time-limited backstop?The temporary measure was agreed as a concession by May to quell a cabinet revolt by UK Brexit secretary David Davis, a hard Brexiteer who threatened resignation if it was not time-limited.What does the Irish Government think of the UK proposal?It welcomed the fact the UK has proposed something but it is still assessing it. Prior to the proposal, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar rejected the idea of a time-limited version of the post-Brexit backstop arrangement because, he said, the whole idea of a backstop was that it should apply until there is an alternative in place that maintains a frictionless, invisible border on the island. It should be an “all-weather” backstop, he said.So what next?The formal response of the EU’s Brexit “task force” team of negotiators is awaited.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3523186.1528400888!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain s remainers are facing a golden opportunity","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit minister David Davis, who threatened to resign this week.

Perhaps it was their way of paying their dues, both with the law and their own conscience.“We can’t exclude the fact that this money was acquired illegally, perhaps from a recent robbery.”Father Giovanni Martire Savina, the parish priest, said that in the past, anonymous donors would leave sums up to 1,000 euros, “but never an amount as large as this.”The church owes its unusual name to kilns making bricks and terracotta tiles that used to exist in the area – “fornaci” means furnaces in Italian.It dates back to the 15th century but was extensively redesigned in the 17th century.   Please review our commenting policyParis bistros launch campaign for UNESCO status as bastions of \u0026#39art de vivre\u0026#39 and defiance to terrorismLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowAnimal rescue workers capture moment orangutan tries to defend its home from loggers  Deadly brain tumours could be heated up by MRI scanners until they die in groundbreaking treatmentQueen had surgery to remove cataract - and wore sunglasses rather than cancel public engagementsUK Chinese embassy warns over students targeted in \u0026#39virtual kidnapping\u0026#39 scamUN sanctions six human traffickers in Libya in global firstPippa Middleton confirms pregnancy and reveals she escaped morning sickness unlike her sister KateLove Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesDonald Trump \u0026#39tired of Theresa May\u0026#39s school mistress tone’ and will not hold talks with her at G7Brexit backstop idea explained - and how it could prevent a hard Irish borderSingapore summit: Everything there is to know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s meeting with Kim Jong-unPalestinian protesters injured by tear gas near Gaza border with Israel Are Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un preparing to declare an end to the Korean War?BMW and DVSA failed to take sufficient action over electrical fault which caused Gurkha veteran\u0026#39s death, inquest hearsComment: If the police can\u0026#39t control crime, we will see more vigilantes – and more sympathy for themDonald Trump throws G7 summit into chaos by saying that Russia should be allowed to rejoin\u0026#39Chinese Spider-Man\u0026#39 hailed a hero after scaling a building to save boy, 2Drug dealers caught passing cannabis to each other in the courtroom in front of shocked judgeOxford student who stabbed her boyfriend admits she will \u0026#39never become a heart surgeon\u0026#39 as she loses appealWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/08/TELEMMGLPICT000165781241_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-WDyyFlZti4vynMgK5j16HtC2sFYbXSjVW3tXWh29cY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"queen had surgery remove cataract wore sunglasses rather cancel","story":"The Queen during a garden party at Buckingham Palace on May 31The Queen has undergone eye surgery to remove a cataract, wearing sunglasses in public rather than cancel her long-planned engagements.The 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May, Buckingham Palace confirmed on Friday afternoon.In recent weeks, the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties.It emerged on Friday that the Queen was treated as a day patient at the private King Edward VII\u0027s hospital in London.When approached, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: I can confirm that the Queen successfully underwent a short planned procedure to treat a cataract last month.The Queen wears sunglasses during the Royal Windsor Horse Show at Windsor Castle on May 13It was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements.The Court Circular, the public record of the working life of the Royal family, shows no major break in the Queen\u0027s work in May, from receiving official visitors at Buckingham Palace to attending the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle with the Duke of Edinburgh, who had recovered from a hip replacement operation.There was a short gap between May 4, when she held an investiture, and May 15 when she undertook a series of jobs including hosting a garden party and welcoming the President of the Republic of Turkey and Mrs. Erdogan to the palace. Cataracts are when the lens, a small transparent disc inside the eye, develops cloudy patches. Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated.Cataracts are more common in the elderly and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities such as driving.The Queen at Epsom Downs Racecourse on June 1A family history of cataracts can increase the risk of developing them.The Queen Mother had an operation to remove a cataract from her left eye in 1995 when she was 95 but, unlike her daughter, she spent a night in King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital after the surgery.Video: The Queen attends Chelsea Flower Show on May 21The Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution. In 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital. She usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.Cataracts occur when changes in the lens of the eye cause it to become less transparent, which results in cloudy or misty vision.This can prevent someone from driving, undertaking work that requires fine detail and recognising faces.Surgery to remove and replace the affected lens with an artificial one is the most common surgical procedure carried out on the NHS.Around 390,000 cataract surgeries take place each year in England and 16,000 in Wales, according to the eye research charity Fight for Sight.The condition most commonly affect adults as a result of ageing. Most people start to develop cataracts after the age of 65, but some people in their forties and fifties can also develop them.Surgery to remove a patient\u0026#39s cataracts. File pictureCataracts, which can affect one or both eyes, are a major cause of sight loss. But the surgery is a straightforward procedure that usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.It is often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic, meaning the patient can go home the same day.During the operation, the surgeon makes a tiny cut in the eye to remove the cloudy lens and replaces it with a clear plastic one.On the NHS, patients are offered monofocal lenses, which have a single point of focus - either near or distance vision.Those going private, like the Queen, can choose either a multifocal or an accommodating lens, which allows the eye to focus on both near and distant objects.The Queen wears sunglasses at Epsom Downs on June 1 - just days after her cataracts procudureMost people will need to wear glasses for some tasks, like reading, after surgery regardless of the type of lens they have fitted.It can take four to six weeks to fully recover from cataract surgery. If cataracts affect both eyes, two separate operations are required, usually carried out six to 12 weeks apart.The risk of serious complications developing as a result of cataract surgery is very low.Worldwide, cataracts are the leading cause of blindness, according to The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, for which the Queen\u0027s daughter-in-law the Countess of Wessex is a global ambassador.Some 65 million people across the globe have been left blind or with moderate to severe visual impairment due to the condition.The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.She has called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.In November 2017, the Prince of Wales led the nation in honouring the country\u0027s war dead on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph.It was the first time that the Queen, as head of state, had watched the ceremony from a nearby balcony, and was seen as a sign of the royal family in transition and an acknowledgement of her age.Just before Christmas 2016, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh both fell ill with heavy colds, forcing them to delay their trip to Sandringham by a day.The Queen watched the 2017 Remembrance Sunday service from a balconyThe Queen was not well enough to attend the Christmas Day service at St Mary Magdalene church and also missed the New Year\u0027s Day one. She later described it as a particularly grisly mixture of cold and flu.She turned 90 in 2016 and, the same year, used the lift rather than stairs to enter Parliament for the State Opening, avoiding the 26 steps of the royal staircase at the Sovereign\u0027s Entrance.Buckingham Palace said the modest adjustment to arrangements were made for the Queen\u0027s comfort. The decision was attributed to the Queen suffering from knee pain.In 2014, the Prince of Wales stood in for the Queen for part of the Order of the Bath service to avoid her having to make an extra journey up and down some steep steps in full regalia.In November 2013, the Duke of Cambridge stepped in to represent the Queen at an investiture ceremony after she suffered some mild discomfort with her ankle after a busy weekend of engagements including the service of remembrance at the Cenotaph.Video: The Queen\u0027s life on screenHer first hospital stay in 10 years came in 2013 when she was 86 after she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea when she was due to present St David\u0027s Day leeks to the 3rd Battalion The Royal Welsh.On March 3 2013, she was admitted to King Edward VII\u0027s Hospital to be assessed. A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled.The Queen spent one night in hospital and left thanking staff and smiling before being driven to Buckingham Palace to rest.It was thought her public appearances were back on track until Buckingham Palace announced on the morning of the Commonwealth Day Observance service on March 11 that she regrettably could no longer attend as she continues to recover following her recent illness.It was the first Commonwealth Day Observance service she had missed in 20 years, the last occasion being when she had flu in 1993.The Queen leaves the King Edward VII hospital in March 2013 following a short stayThe Queen, who placed great importance to her role as Head of the Commonwealth, did however attend the Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House on the evening of March 11 to sign the new Commonwealth Charter.Buckingham Palace insisted it was just the tail end of the symptoms and that her condition had not worsened.But the next day she cancelled her engagements for the rest of the week, with her son, the Duke of York, saying later that it was sensible not to risk her coming out, but that she was not ill.Her illnesses have been few and far between over the years. She has suffered from back pain, and also had operations to remove torn cartilage from both knees.She caught measles when Prince Charles was two months old in 1949 and had to be separated from her baby son.Queen Elizabeth II: Our monarch in picturesThe first time the Queen was actually admitted to hospital was in July 1982 when she had a wisdom tooth extracted at the King Edward VII Hospital in central London.The Queen\u0027s no-fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk.The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital.It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham.Please review our commenting policyParis bistros launch campaign for UNESCO status as bastions of \u0026#39art de vivre\u0026#39 and defiance to terrorismLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowAnimal rescue workers capture moment orangutan tries to defend its home from loggers  Deadly brain tumours could be heated up by MRI scanners until they die in groundbreaking treatmentMystery in Italy after £31,000 in cash found stashed in priest\u0026#39s confessional in Rome churchUK Chinese embassy warns over students targeted in \u0026#39virtual kidnapping\u0026#39 scamUN sanctions six human traffickers in Libya in global firstPippa Middleton confirms pregnancy and reveals she escaped morning sickness unlike her sister KateLove Island 2018: From contestants to recoupling, a beginner\u0026#39s guide to the new seriesDonald Trump \u0026#39tired of Theresa May\u0026#39s school mistress tone’ and will not hold talks with her at G7Brexit backstop idea explained -

the first time ever that smugglers have been targeted by the global body\u0027s Security Council.The sanctions include a global travel ban and an assets freeze of six of the most prolific smugglers who took advantage of the insecurity in Libya to move hundreds of thousands of migrants by sea to Europe.Libya emerged as a major conduit for African migrants hoping to reach Europe after a Nato-backed uprising toppled and killed the country\u0027s longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and the country slid into chaos, with rival governments and parliaments based in the western and eastern regions, each backed by different militias and tribes.Refugees receive life jackets as they are rescued by aid workers, after leaving Libya trying to reach European soil aboard an overcrowded rubber boat,Among those named by the UN were Abd al Rahman al-Milad, regional Libyan coast guard leader, and Mus\u0027ab Abu-Qarin, said to have organised journeys over sea for 45,000 people in 2015 alone.They appeared on the sanctions list alongside Ahmad Oumar Al-Dabbashi, commander of the Anas al-Dabbashi militia that is currently active around the northwestern coastal town of Zawiya.It said there was extensive evidence that Dabbashi\u0027s militia has been directly involved in the illicit trafficking and smuggling of migrants, and that his militia controls departure areas for migrants, camps, safe houses and boats.The committee said the militia has longstanding links with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) in North Africa.A member of a rescue team carries a migrant baby after being rescued by Libyan coast guards in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of LibyaThe militia is also reported to have received money from the government in Tripoli, which was paid by the Italian government to try to curb the huge flows of migrants leaving Libya.As a result of the decision to attempt to stop the boats trying to reach Europe, many thousands of migrants are trapped in detention centres, and many of them are forced to pay bribes they cannot afford for their release.Last December, the African Union said between 400,000 and 700,000 migrants were thought to be being held in more than 40 detention camps across Libya, often under inhumane conditions.The Netherlands Mission, which led the efforts, said its aim is to destroy the business model of human trafficking networks and tackle the appalling human rights situation of migrants that were sold as slaves on the markets of Libya.There was widespread global outrage after video footage was broadcast on CNN last November showing the auction and sale of migrant men as slaves in Libya.The Security Council condemned the sale of African migrants into slavery in Libya as heinous abuses of human rights that may constitute crimes against humanity.Recalling the images of migrants being sold as slaves which shocked our conscience and the Security Council\u0027s vow to take action, Nikki Haley, US ambassador, said the sanctions send a strong message that the international community is united in seeking accountability for perpetrators of human trafficking and smuggling.Mrs Haley said blacklisting the six men is part of a larger international effort to seek accountability for those involved in migrant smuggling and trafficking that threatens the peace, security, or stability of Libya.In selecting the six men, she said there was close collaboration between the US, Britain, the Netherlands, France, and Germany.Please review our commenting policyLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowAnimal rescue workers capture moment orangutan tries to defend its home from loggers  Deadly brain tumours could be heated up by MRI scanners until they die in groundbreaking treatmentMystery in Italy after £31,000 in cash found stashed in priest\u0026#39s confessional in Rome churchQueen had surgery to remove cataract -

After further study of the field at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, she returned to Columbia as director of its new anaesthesia ision, its first female head of department.Building the unit from the ground up in partnership with her old mentor Dr Allen Whipple\u0026nbsp(who had steered her away from surgery), Dr Apgar\u0026nbspworked tireless as both a practising physician and administrator, no easy task when America’s entry into the Second World War in 1941 created significant staffing shortages.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspdeveloped her five-point score for assessing\u0026nbspnewborn health\u0026nbspin 1952. The test grades babies on scores of zero to two on five key criteria: the colour of their skin, their pulse rate, their reflex ability, their responsiveness to limb flexion and their respiratory rate. The resulting scores are totted up to give a total out of 10 indicating the health or otherwise of the infant in question.The criteria can be remembered by the acronym\u0026nbsp”Apgar”, standing for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration.In 1959, by which point her test had been rolled out across US maternity\u0026nbsphospitals, Dr Apgar\u0026nbspleft the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center to\u0026nbspearn\u0026nbspa Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health and served as vice president for medical affairs at the March of Dimes Foundation to advance the study of birth defects.She was an outspoken advocate for universal vaccinations\u0026nbspto prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella during the pandemic that struck 12.5m people in the US between 1964-65 and contributed more than 60 articles to newspapers, magazines and academic journals, publishing her book Is My Baby All Right? with Joan Beck\u0026nbspin 1973.Dr Apgar\u0026nbspwas known throughout her career for her warm bedside manner and forthright optimism. In her personal life, she played the violin, enjoyed a range of hobbies from fly-fishing and stamp collecting\u0026nbspand took flying lessons, dreaming of swooping under the George Washington Bridge.Although\u0026nbspshe rarely campaigned against or spoke publicly about gender inequalities, Dr Virginia Apgar\u0026nbspglided past\u0026nbspthe sexism of her period with ease, preferring instead to lead by example and allow her professional excellence and commitment to her work speak for itself.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

While the discovery does not shed light on whether Mars was once home to alien life,\u0026nbspand whether it could still be,\u0026nbspthe findings could be the result of ancient life there.“The chances of being able to find signs of ancient life with future missions, if life ever was present, just went up,” said Curiosity’s project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada of Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\u0026nbspExperts say that the findings should propel us to look for conclusive evidence of alien life living on the planet.“With these new findings, Mars is telling us to stay the course and keep searching for evidence of life,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at Nasa\u0026nbspheadquarters\u0026nbspin Washington. “I’m confident that our ongoing and planned missions will unlock even more breathtaking discoveries on the Red Planet.”The new announcement is actually the result of two\u0026nbspnew studies that reveal vast\u0026nbspdetail about how methane exists on the planet, as well as the unexpected organic molecules that are preserved in its soil.And one team has made a significant breakthrough in our attempt to understand the ancient organic matter on Mars, which could help us discover\u0026nbspwhether the world was once habitable and what happened to it in the billions of years since.The surface of Mars is inhospitable today. But in the past, it almost certainly had liquid water, which could have helped fuel life there.The Curiosity rover has headed to an area that was thought to once have been a large lake of that water, inside Gale Crater. It was inside that hole where scientists found the new findings, which suggest the\u0026nbspwater lake had all the necessary ingredients for life – from chemical building blocks\u0026nbspto the energy sources required to sustain life.\u0026nbspThe two studies appear in the journal Science. In a companion article, an outside expert describes the findings as “breakthroughs in astrobiology”.\u0026nbsp“The question of whether life might have originated or existed on Mars is a lot more opportune now that we know that organic molecules were present on its surface at the time,” wrote Utrecht University astrobiologist Inge Loes ten Kate of the Netherlands.\u0026nbspKirsten Siebach, a Rice University geologist who was also not involved in the studies, is equally excited. She said the discoveries break down some of the strongest arguments put forward by life-on-Mars sceptics, herself included.\u0026nbsp“The big takeaway is that we can find evidence. We can find organic matter preserved in mudstones that are more than 3 billion years old,” Ms Siebach said. “And we see releases of gas today that could be related to life in the subsurface, or at the very least are probably related to warm water or environments where Earth life would be happy living.”\u0026nbspThe methane observations provide “one of the most compelling” cases for present-day life, she said.\u0026nbspScientists have long been baffled by the discovery of significant amounts of methane on Mars. On Earth, most methane is produced by biological sources, leading to hopes\u0026nbspthe Red Planet is more alive than we had thought.The new data suggests\u0026nbspthe methane is being stored underneath the surface of the planet. Seasonal changes appear to bring that methane out and onto the surface, where it has been detected by Curiosity,\u0026nbspsuggest the scientists.Another piece of research published simultaneously shows that intriguing organic molecules have been found in ancient rock on Mars. Curiosity took new samples and heated them so that it could analyse the molecules that were released – and the data showed there is certain matter\u0026nbspsimilar to the kind of organic-rich rock found on Earth.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

It really broadens the scope of possibilities.The fossils also provide insights into the evolution of tetrapods from fish during this period.Dr Gess said that the Devonian tetrapods ultimately pioneered the way for our ancestors up out of a dangerous, swampy world into the sunshine and a bright new future.The discovery was made at Waterloo Farm near Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape after the South African National Roads Agency carried out controlled rock-cutting explosions along the N2 highway.This cutting exposed dark grey mudstones of the Witpoort Formation that represent an ancient environment of a brackish, tidal river estuary that contains abundant fossils of animals and plants.The research was supported by the South African DST-NRF Centre of Excellence in Palaeosciences, based at the University of the Witwatersrand and the Millennium Trust.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK’s plan tries to get around introducing checks by keeping the whole UK aligned with those rules, and also introduces a time-limit on the backstop.\u0026nbspBut while Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbspsaid he was continuing the study the UK proposals, he warned that applying the backstop plan to the whole UK was not an option.“Let me be very clear: our backstop cannot be extended to the whole UK. Why? Because it has been designed for the specific situation of Northern Ireland,” he said.“What does it do? On customs, Northern Ireland would form part of our customs territory. What is feasible with a territory the size of Northern Ireland is not necessarily feasible with the whole UK.\u0026nbsp“On regulatory alignment we have been pragmatic and developed the least disruptive system for citizens and businesses on both sides. Let’s go to pragmatism. Checks carried out on ferries are less disruptive than along a\u0026nbsp500km\u0026nbspland border.”He also suggested the backstop could not be time-limited or temporary, as the UK has requested,\u0026nbspwarning: “Backstop means backstop.”\u0026nbspThe chief negotiator said he would continue looking at the UK’s proposals, despite highlighting what he said were a series of problems with them. He said the plan needed to address “full regulatory alignment” rather than only customs, that it needed to respect the integrity of the single market, and that the arrangement should be “all-weather” and prevent a hard border in all circumstances.\u0026nbspAsked why he was continuing to look at the British proposal if he had raised such fatal flaws with it, he said: “Because I look at all British proposals in an objective manner.Mr\u0026nbspBarnier\u0026nbsprepeated his familiar refrain that Britain’s negotiators appeared to want to keep the benefits of the EU without accepting the obligations of membership.\u0026nbspBut\u0026nbsphe added: “When we tell our British counterparts that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created by the European Union … some parties in the United Kingdom responsible for the consequences of that decision.\u0026nbsp“Let me say the following: We’re not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union we respect that democratic decisions and we are implementing it.”He said there had been some progress on other issues but that sticking points included data protection, geographical indications for products, and some matters relating to state aid. Theresa May is set to attend a summit in Brussels later this month that the EU has characterised as a staging-post to a final deal, which it wants signed by October.A British Government spokesperson said: “The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. We are also committed to maintaining the integrity of our own internal market. That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.“All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts. Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Just 0.85 per cent of the public say Brexit has made them less likely to support a united Ireland.Support for the cause is more popular among\u0026nbspthe younger generation than the old, with 49.4 per cent of under-45s backing a break with the UK compared to 37.7 per cent who want to stay in it.\u0026nbspThough Catholics are significantly more likely to support joining the Republic than Protestants, a minority of the latter, 8.5 per cent, say they support leaving the UK. An overall majority (50.2 per cent) in Northern Ireland’s capital, Belfast,\u0026nbspsupport a united Ireland.Northern Ireland has become the focus of Brexit talks because it is set to become the only future land border between the EU and UK. But under the Good Friday Agreement which brought an end to the Troubles, there cannot be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\u0026nbspThough the Government and EU both say they are committed to avoiding a hard border, leaked tapes released on Thursday showed Boris Johnson, the\u0026nbspforeign secretary,\u0026nbspsaying\u0026nbspit was “just beyond belief” that the issue was being taken so seriously and that\u0026nbsp focusing on such a “small” item amounted to “allowing the tail to wag the dog”.The YouGov poll also found that 81.3 per cent of the Northern Ireland population do not believe that politicians reflect concerns of the people in the six counties well, while just 17.1 per cent did.Leo Varadkar, the\u0026nbspIrish prime minister,\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that a border poll would be “isive” and “a bad idea”.\u0026nbspThe taoiseach, who is visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, told the Good Morning Ulster programme: “We should be respecting the primacy of the Good Friday Agreement and, at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, is power sharing within Northern Ireland, ever-increasing cooperation within the north and south and peace in Britain and Ireland.“While the Good Friday Agreement provides for the possibility of a border poll, and would allow that to pass by a majority of one, I don’t think the time or the conditions are right.“I think the focus should be on getting the institutions up and running again, rather than focusing on a border poll.”His comments came after former first minister Peter Robinson argued that any future border poll could not be conducted on the basis of a simple majority.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I find it particularly interesting that the Israeli tweet uses a meme with women to react to the Ayatollah\u0026nbspKhamenei’s tweet.”Israel’s Mean Girls gif had been retweeted more than 9,000 times and liked more than 27,000 times within a day of being posted.The Twitter exchange came amid growing tensions in the Middle East since Donald Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and reimposing sanctions on Iran.\u0026nbspOn Tuesday, Benjamin\u0026nbspNetanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, sought to convince European states to abandon the deal, claiming Tehran’s threats to increase uranium enrichment capacity showed it still planned to destroy Israel.Britain, France and Germany are scrambling to\u0026nbspsave the accord, under which Iran\u0026nbsppromised to curb its nuclear programme in return for lifted sanctions.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces\u0027​Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to carry out direct military strikes targeting President Bashar al-Assad’s regime unless all Iranian forces are withdrawn from Syria.\u0026nbspThe aggressive ultimatum to Damascus is a significant escalation in the confrontation in Syria between Israel and Iran.The Syrian leader was “no longer immune, his regime is no longer immune. If he fires at us, we will destroy his forces,”\u0026nbspMr Netanyahu declared during a visit to London, speaking at a question and answer session at the Policy Exchange think tank.Israel has carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and has repeatedly demanded that Iran, which it considers “an existential threat”, must remove its forces and weapons from Syria.But this was the first time that it had been stated that the Assad regime would be punished for the presence of Iranian forces, which have been fighting Isis\u0026nbspand Islamist rebels.Mr Netanyahu said: “I think there is a new calculus that has to take place and Syria has to understand that Israel will not tolerate the Iranian military entrenchment in Syria against Israel.“The consequences are not merely to the Iranian forces there but to the Assad regime as well, I think it’s something that he should consider very seriously.”The Israeli prime minister blamed Assad personally for the presence of Tehran’s forces in Syria as he warned of possible Israeli intervention.“Assad has to consider this: when they waged this horrific civil war, Israel did not intervene. Now the war is nearly over, he invites Iran in to entrench itself?” \u0026nbspThe Syrian leader was accused of facilitating Tehran “to move its army a thousand miles so it can threaten Israel. They want to bring in precision guided rockets with half a ton warheads and submarines to the Mediterranean… Iran does not believe in a master race, it believes in a master faith,” and is bent on conquest, Mr Netanyahu charged.The prime minister is on a tour of Western Europe to try to drum up support for further action against Iran, after US President Donald Trump reneged on an agreement between international powers and Tehran over its nuclear programme.The other signatories to the deal – Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China – as well as the United Nations have all stressed that it was working and the Iranian government was abiding by its commitment.Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May have told Mr Netanyahu that they are\u0026nbspdetermined not to abandon the agreement, the scrapping of which could lead to nuclear proliferation in the region and beyond, they warned.That, he boasted, had been effectively destroyed by him and Mr Trump.He warned European businesses of the punitive fines they would face under American sanctions if they continued trading with Iran.Mr Netanyahu stated that his aim on the trip, instead, was to “expose” how “Iran is devouring one nation after another” and ask Western European governments to do more “about reversing Iran’s aggression in the region and getting them out of Syria”.The French, German and British leaders have all raised their concerns with Mr Netanyahu about the recent brutal violence at the Gaza border in which dozens of Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops.The UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urged the Israeli government to open an independent inquiry into the deaths and injuries suffered during the protests.Asked at the London meeting why non-lethal methods, such as water cannons and rubber bullets, were not used, or even a policy of shooting at legs, rather than shoot to kill, not pursued, Mr Netanyahu insisted: “We have tried all these methods, they don’t work. These were not non-violent protests, quite the contrary.“We are doing everything we can to both minimise casualties and, at the same time, protect Israeli lives.”Referring to Israel’s success in technological innovations, Mr Netanyahu added “given our record, we probably will figure something out, but we haven’t got there yet. The last thing we want is violence or confrontation.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

but now admitted to Leave supporters in the Cabinet that the possibility of billions of pounds heading to Brussels was unpalatable.In a letter from Mrs May to her MPs, the Prime Minister admitted that her plan for a backstop arrangement was flawed - and hit a notably different tone than the one she adopted to address her Remain supporting MPs earlier this week.Mrs May said in her letter: To put it frankly, if we are to make good progress in the negotiations and deliver the smooth, orderly and successful Brexit the country wants, we need to agree with the EU the terms of the backstop.We have a choice between the Commission\u0027s proposal, which however hypothetical must be unacceptable in principal to anyone who believes in the Union of the United Kingdom and an alternative that is unpalatable but, at worst, temporary.\u0026lsquoIt doensn\u0027t mean Brexit!\u0027 Portillo BLASTS Brexit backstop \u0027nonsense\u0027Andrew Neil warns UK has been \u0027outmanoeuvred\u0027 over Brexit backstopThat is why we are advancing this proposal.The news comes after she faced down a Cabinet revolt led by Brexit minister David Davis and agreed to a plan that could keep Britain tied to certain parts of the European Union after Brexit in 2019.The backstop proposal, which is at the centre of a devastating Cabinet row, aims to stop Britain entering into certain types of trade deal.The proposal states that if the country and EU cannot negotiate a deal, it would remain in the EU-wide framework of trade deals.Theresa May faced down a revolt led by Brexit Secretary David DavisIt would be able to implement only those parts of new free trade deals not covered by this temporary customs arrangement.This points to the fact that it would be impossible to strike a trade deal involving goods, since the UK would have to maintain EU tariff rates.Aides close to EU Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier claimed that he welcomed the publication of a new proposal.They say he also added that arrangements would have to last as long as was necessary to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Writing for Express on May 31, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg echoed the notion that the UK needs to fully leave the customs union to honour the Brexit vote.Mr Mogg said: The customs union membership is binary and Leave won.Alas, the Treasury has wasted precious months coming up with complex and unworkable alternative models that prove this essential point.The truth is that leaving the EU\u0026rsquos customs union is necessary to keep faith with the referendum result and reap the benefits of Brexit.If we remain in it we will accept EU laws, collect EU taxes and have ourselves a trade policy where we are without any say \u0026ndash a vassal state."},{"url":null,"title":"weather","story":"A BLAST of roasting air from Africa is about to engulf Britain triggering the start of what is...ALLERGY sufferers are on alert for hay-fever hell this week as warm weather triggers a pollen...MEGA-HAILSTONES bigger than golf-balls had today damaged properties and injured pedestrians in...MASSIVE thunderstorms brought fresh flooding and travel chaos to Britain yesterday -

Target2 data is often watched closely by analysts as a measurement of capital flows.The jump in debt is thought to have been caused by the surprise coalition government formed by the alt-left Five Star Movement and hard-right Lega parties.David Owen of Jefferies Investment Banking Group said foreign funds are being rotated out of Italy and into accounts in northern Europe, particularly in Germany, Luxembourg or The Netherlands.The Bank of Italy\u0027s liabilities to the European Central Bank jumped \u0026pound34.1bn (\u0026euro39bn) in a single                WATCH: Italian PM gets STANDING OVATION from Senators                EU WARNING: Merkel told to spend MORE in eurozoneHe said a key worry was Italian residents following suit by withdrawing savings from local banks and setting up foreign accounts, which would echo the financial crisis in Greece in 2015.Mr Owen said: If that happens the picture could become really serious.

They may well calm off, but at this exact moment, they are the worst ever.”The unusually cold start to the year has meant the insects have arrived a little later than normal, but Scottish locals have said they are now being terrorised.Meanwhile, Lucy Fraser, from Rowardennan, Stirling, says she has become a prisoner in her own home.The hotelier claims a contractor even had to stop laying new decking at her home because the midges are so bad.She said: “I insist the guests don’t open the windows.

She said: “The backstop is time limited. It may never be used.”In a letter to Tories, seen by The Times, even the PM called the UK proposal “unpalatable but at worst temporary” and “in no way the Government’s intended or desired” result.1000: Mrs May summons Liam Fox and Boris Johnson to test their views.

Petrie-Harrison and Jackson, of Basingstoke, admitted burglary.They all got suspended prison sentences of between 12 and 16 months.But despite the convictions, the dogs could not be returned to their owner because they did not have microchips.Ms Cowling said: “This is two years later and I am still very anxious. I just wish they could tell me where my babies are.“Even though they were kennelled, they were very much loved. I just want my dogs back.”Earlier this year, analysis of crime stats by an insurance firm put Lincolnshire as the dog theft capital of Britain.Another breeder from the county said: “People watch 101 Dalmatians and Cruella de Vil and think it is only a movie, but this is happening in real life.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is what makes it so dangerous.Even half a pill can be a dangerously high dose on its own and the risk is increased if alcohol and other drugs are taken at the same time.He warned some pills contained 300mg of MDMA - three times a strong dose for an adult male.Super-strength ecstasy alone caused the deaths of more than 60 people in England and Wales in 2016.Police across the UK have already shared stark warnings against taking illicit substances, stressing the dangers of taking pills with unknown ingredients.Hampshire Police have launched an investigation into the deaths of Georgia Jones, 18, and Tommy Cowan, 20, after the pair died while attending Mutiny Festival.Festival organisers issued an urgent warning about super-strength drugs circulating the campsite before cancelling the second day of the event, attended by tens of thousands of people.Parklife festival, in Heaton, Manchester, shared a photo from drugs testing NGO The Loop to warn revellers, saying a VERY strong batch of pills were in circulation.The festival’s official Twitter account posted: “No doubt you have seen in the press about two very sad tragedies at a festival over the weekend.“There is a VERY strong batch of pills in circulation, with strength over 330mg.“These tablets, along with others, can result in death. Please act responsibly \u0026amp look after each other.”The Loop is an NGO that campaigns for and provide drug safety testing at music festivals.Blue Punisher ecstasy pills the group tested in Bristol last week were found to contain 300mg of MDMA, more than three times the normal dose in a pill.Other tablets found by The Loop included “Silver” ecstasy which could contain up to four times the regular dose.A third heart shaped pill was said to contain pentylone instead of MDMA which can cause insomnia and paranoia for anywhere between 12 and 48 hours.West Yorkshire Police also issued a warning to the public about the dangers of drugs after officers stopped a group of teens in the town of Castleford in Wakefield on June 5.Two girls were arrested on public order offences before being taken to hospital, and a 13-year-old boy was later arrested in connection with drugs-related offences.It is believed the young girls had taken Snapchat pills.West Yorkshire Police said the two girls had since been released from hospital, with no further action taken after their arrests. The teen boy was also released under investigation.The force tweeted: We want to remind the public about the dangers of drugs. Drugs are often given catchy names to appeal to young people.

backstop plan","story":"No10 issued a quick slap-down today after the EUs Brexit poured cold water on her plans to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after we leave the EU.As Mrs Mays day turned from bad to worse this lunchtime, Mr Barnier insisted that her backstop plans raise more questions than it provides and rubbished the idea of an end-date of the agreement.Mr Barnier argued that checks on ferries crossing between Northern Ireland and the UK in the event of the back-up plans being needed would be much less disruptive than checks along a 500km land border.That would effectively put the border back in the Irish sea - something which has already been thrown out by Britain and Northern Ireland.Mrs Mays Government partners, the DUP, would never agree to anything which separates them from the mainland.No10 hit back with a furious statement, insisting Mrs May would never do anything to split up the UK.A spokesperson said:  The Prime Minster has been clear that we will never accept a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.And the DUP were also fuming, saying Mr Barniers latest demands for Northern Ireland shows they have no respect for the UK at all.Deputy DUP leader Nigel Dodds stormed: This is nothing more than an outrageous attempt to revert to the annexation of Northern Ireland.We will not accept such a proposal.Instead he said the focus should be on getting a trade deal, and to forget about the back up plans altogether.The EUs chief Brexit negotiator caused chaos this afternoon when he appeared to throw out Britains Northern Ireland backstop plans altogether.He was originally thought to have said that there was no way the plans for the whole of the UK would be acceptable - but then clarified later in a tweet that he was talking about his own plans.This is not a rejection of the UK customs paper on which discussions continue, he added.Elsewhere in his press conference, Mr Barnier stormed in an angry rant: When we tell them, our British counterparts, that these benefits are not accessible outside the system created and this is the result of them deciding to leave, some try to make us responsible for the consequence of that decision.We are not going to be intimidated by this form of blame game. The UK has decided to leave the EU - we respect that and are implementing that, but the UK has to accept that has consequences.And he called on Britain to show more trust and realism in ongoing talks with the bloc.Mr Barnier said the option to keep Northern Ireland inside the EUs customs union was an exceptional one and that nothing like it had ever been agreed before.But he did say he was willing to talk to find a solution.Mrs May hit back immediately to Mr Barniers comments, saying she would never compromise the unity of the UK.That position will not change. The Commission’s proposals did not achieve this, which is why we have put forward our own backstop solutions for customs.All parties must recall their commitment in the Joint Report to protect the Belfast Agreement in all its parts.Michel Barnier has confirmed today that discussions will now continue on our proposal.The news comes just hours after it emerged that Boris Johnson had lashed out at Remainers in the cabinet, spilling Mrs Mays top team into an open civil war.The Foreign Secretary described the Treasury as the heart of Remain and warned of a meltdown in EU negotiations to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I would never want to be recognised as that guy by people that had read the article.But despite the questionable associations, Yair doesnt regret selling the photo.I love the picture and enjoy seeing it from time-to-time on other ads, he says.I could have done without the bestiality story, but it was a minor website and luckily the article is no longer available online so theres no real harm done. I wasnt sure how to react at first, but today I look at it as a funny turn of events and laugh about it.Niccolò Massariello, a Spanish writer for Vice, revealed how his stock photos ended up on adverts for booze, milk, the Catholic Church and even paraphimosis  - a horrifying penis condition in which the foreskin gets trapped behind the tip of the penis.Following a tricky break up, Niccolò embarked on an impulsive photoshoot with a mate to try and take his mind off stuff, and signed away his rights to the images without realising the potential repercussions.He discovered his images had been sold months later when he saw his face on an article about terrorists on a Catholic website.“That in itself wasnt so bad, but it was then that I realised I had no control over what might happen to my face,” he told Vice.In the following months, Niccolò’s face was used to promote anything and everything, from gluten-free drinks and Columbian spirits to articles on vindictive exes and “jerks” at work.Things then went from bad to worse, with Niccolò finding his increasingly-popular face on the cover of a book about monsters, an advert for shaving, and, finally, on national campaign about a very serious penis problem in Venezuela.As I was getting up one morning a friend from Venezuela asked me on Whatsapp if I had – or had ever had – paraphimosis, a very serious penis issue, he explained.I told my friend that I might have had some issues down there in the past, but that I dont remember it being called that.Nicos friend then informed him that he was the poster boy for paraphimosis in Venezuela.I know I cant really complain – I was fully conscious when I had those pictures taken and I actively signed away the rights to my face, he says.Still, that doesnt mean I dont rue the day I posed for those pictures. Briefly feeling a little better about myself that day does not compare to the fact I have no idea where my face will show up next.Like many others in her situation, Samantha Ovens stock image modelling shots - which were originally taken for a campaign on cold and flu medication - were used for something she could never have imagined.Samantha, who is gay, was out with her friends when she was first alerted to the fact that her face had been used on article, titled: “I fantasise about group sex with old, obese men,” on the s anonymous sex column.The piece, written in first person, explained how the author, a 31-year-old woman, struggled with fantasies about being “passed around” by fat, ugly old men.“The thing that really turns me on is the idea of having to lift their stomachs and search for their penises, which are always difficult to find and a bit on the soft side,” is just one of the graphic lines in the first paragraph which Samantha’s image was next to.Luckily, the successful model, who usually specialises in portraying mums on shoot, found the whole thing hilarious.I was with my partners mum [when I first saw it], Samantha told the  later. I screeched with laughter and said: Oh. You have to see this.“How can you take it seriously? There are bigger things in this life to get concerned about.In a much more serious case, a British family’s image was used on a poster campaign by an Irish group opposing gay marriage ahead of the 2015 referendum - a campaign which they strongly disagreed with.In an anonymous interview with the BBC, the family said they were given a free photo shoot in exchange for allowing the photographer to sell the images on.The photo was not stolen from us... we have no claim over (or rights to) the picture, and we do not claim otherwise, the family said.We just wanted publicly to say that we disagreed with the No campaign and were unhappy about their use of our image, but we acknowledge that theyre allowed to do so.Other examples of awkwardly-placed stock images include Simon Naylors face on an article about Viagra which was pointed out to him in his local pub.Thought nothing of signing over a few headshots for use as stock images, until my local pub landlord spotted me in Take A Break, he tweeted.But we dont think its quite as bad as this poor girls holiday snap being used as an advert for colonic procedures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Unless your child is taller than 135cm or over the age of 12 then they legally need to be in a car seat. And quite apart from the law, kids\u0027 car seats save lives and prevent serious injuries. When riding a bike it\u0027s important to have the right safety gear too. Although there is no legal requirement to wear a helmet, recent research shows that wearing one significantly reduces the risk of sustaining a head injury. Child Safety Week is designed to help parents and carers understand how best to keep kids safe and Halfords has an amazing range of bike and car equipment that will help. From car seats to bike lights there\u0027s lots of gear to keep your little ones safe on the road and lots of in-store expert advice to help you fit what you buy. Car safety: Babies and toddlers    Very small children need additional protection and modern car seats offer a lot of features to keep your baby as safe as possible – for example, extra neck and head supports mean that they are protected in an impact. The Joie Spin 360 is versatile. It can be rear-facing for infants up to 9kg and switched to forward-facing for kids between 9 and 18kg. It rotates so you can get your baby out of the car easily and it has five recline settings for both forward and rear-facing modes. ISOFIX compliance means it mounts to hard anchors in your car for maximum safety. Car safety: Older kids  Once your kids weigh more than 15kg they need a group 2-3 booster seat. These are adjustable to allow your children to use them up until 12 years or a weight of 36kg. After that weight, they can rely on normal car seatbelts. The Joie Trilo Inkewell has washable seat covers (crucial, given the amount of time they\u0027re used for and how messy little ones can be) and offer side impact protection and an adjustable headrest. There\u0027s even a cupholder! If you don\u0027t have ISOFIX mounts in your car then the Halfords Highback Booster Seat offers excellent protection and are secured by the car\u0027s seatbelt. There\u0027s an included cupholder, washable cover and adjustable headrest. It also has side impact protection too, as you\u0027d expect.  Halfords also has an in-store car seat demo and fitting service too, which will help you learn how the seats need to be fitted and ensure they’re compatible with your car. Car safety: High-backed or backless boosters There are two different kinds of booster seat on the market. High-backed tend to have more advantages which include supporting a child’s head, allowing them to sleep and protecting them in an accident. High-backed seats also help to keep the seatbelt correctly positioned on children, especially smaller kids. Backless booster seats are, on the whole, cheaper though and may suit older and larger children slightly more than those with backs. Bike safety: helmets    The first thing any young cyclist needs is a helmet. Young kids might like to choose a fun design and Halfords has Polka Dots , princesses , stars or even an absolutely awesome skull design, along with a range of fun colours. Prices start at \u0026pound10. Older kids might like the Mongoose Urban Helmet, which looks cool and offers excellent protection. It\u0027s also available in either black and white, to suit their style. Halfords has a great range of helmets and in-store experts can help you find the right helmet for your little one.

The Foreign Secretary has been secretly recorded boasting to right-wing Tory activists about Brexit, Trump and North Korea at a private dinner. Leaked to BuzzFeed News and The Times, the remarks are embarrassing at best. And at worst they\u0027re not only deeply unprofessional - they undermine the entire govenrment. Mr Johnson steamrollered Theresa May\u0027s Brexit plan and campaigned hard for his own vision in the address to Conservative Way Forward.  He ridiculed warnings about Brexit as pure millennium bug stuff, dismissed official claims his customs plan will cost \u0026pound20bn a year, and said: I\u0027m not going to hide it from you, there is an argument. A lot of this isn\u0027t surprising - and Tory MP Gerald Howarth today even said the tape serves a valuable purpose for Brexiteers. But some of his comments went much, much further. Here we analyse the most eye-popping bits of what Boris said - and why it could come back to bite him. 1. Donald Trump should do Brexit  What he said: Boris said he is “increasingly admiring of Donald Trump and more and more convinced that there is method in his madness...Trump to negotiate Brexit , what a fantastic idea... Imagine Trump doing Brexit. He’d go in bloody hard. There’d be all sorts of breakdowns, all sorts of chaos. Everyone would think he’d gone mad. But actually you might get somewhere. It’s a very, very good thought.” Why it\u0027s a problem: This exposes the way Boris thinks - preferring chaos to his boss\u0027s \u0027strong and stable\u0027 mantra. It inflates the US President\u0027s large ego just as the world is supposed to be taking him down a peg over steel tariffs. And it\u0027s a direct attack on Theresa May, suggesting she\u0027s inferior to another world leader and not getting anywhere with her Brexit talks. 2. Brexit will trigger a meltdown and the EU is the \u0027enemy\u0027  What he said: “I think Theresa is going to go into a phase where we are much more combative with Brussels. You’ve got to face the fact there may now be a meltdown. OK? I don’t want anybody to panic during the meltdown. No panic. Pro bono publico, no bloody panic. It’s going to be all right in the end.... Take the fight to the enemy - absolutely right. We need to and we will. Why it\u0027s a problem: It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that a minister is admitting his own strategy will trigger a \u0027meltdown\u0027 and could cause \u0027panic\u0027. It\u0027s also hugely damaging to Theresa May\u0027s constant efforts to tell Brussels she\u0027s approaching Brexit talks in a co-operative way. Describing the EU as the \u0027enemy\u0027 is a definite no-no from the UK\u0027s top diplomat. 3. The \u0027heart of Remain\u0027 Treasury is a \u0027quivering wreck\u0027  What he said: The Treasury, which is basically the heart of Remain... What they don’t want is friction at the borders. They don’t want any disruption of the economy. So they’re sacrificing all the medium and long-term gains out of fear of short-term disruption. Do you see what I\u0027m saying? The fear of short-term disruption has become so huge in people’s minds that they’ve turned into a quivering wreck. The Project Fear is irreversible! They’re terrified of this nonsense! It’s mumbo jumbo. Why it\u0027s a problem: Again, it is extraordinary for a serving government minister to attack his own government like this. It\u0027s no secret that the Treasury, under Chancellor Philip Hammond, is pro-Remain. But here is Boris attacking civil servants too as terrified and quivering wrecks. It\u0027s certainly not in the spirit of collective responsibility, where each minister is meant to agree publicly with the whole government. And it\u0027s likely to sour relations even more between warring Cabinet ministers. 4. US has asked him to dismantle Kim\u0027s nuclear missile  What he said: Of course we’ve got to help the Americans do this thing…. I just talked to Mike Pompeo, my counterpart in the US State Department. What they want us to do is to use our nuclear expertise to dismantle Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear missile. That’s what he asked me to do today.” Why it\u0027s a problem: North Korea, of course, knows Britain wants it to dismantle nuclear weapons. But usually talks between allies are conducted in private with only brief summaries provided to the media. Civil servants who work on national security go through exhaustive background checks and are given firm instructions not to talk about their work. This kind of highly sensitive detail is an extraordinary thing to be casually revealing to activists at a private dinner. 5.

When the leaders of the world’s richest countries meet today in Canada, Britain will need our Prime Minister to stand up for the country’s workforce. The UK’s steel industry and its 32,000 employees are under threat from President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to jack up tariffs on steel, and Theresa May must take a lead at the summit in calling him out. The Trump tariffs are simply wrong.  They are bad news for British workers and industry. They are also bad news for US workers and industry. It is vital that all the leaders come together to condemn the Trump tariffs. We need to stop the escalation of a tit-for-tat trade war that can only be bad news for all workers and businesses. As I told the GMB trade union conference in Brighton this week, US workers are right to want a government that actively supports them and the real, everyday economy.  But the Trump tariffs don’t do that. And neither does the Trump agenda of giving handouts to the super-rich, while propping up a rigged system that hoards power and wealth for a tiny elite. Whether it’s over Trump’s Muslim ban and his shameless promotion of the far right Britain First group, his dangerous decision to abandon the Paris Climate Accord or his wilful tearing up of the Iran nuclear deal, Theresa May has repeatedly shown she doesn’t have the courage to stand up for what we all know to be right.  The Tories want to appease Trump in the hope of getting a quick trade deal with the US after we leave the European Union. But what their reaction to the Trump tariffs show is that with the timid Tories in government, we’ll end up with worst kind of race-to-the-bottom deal. That would hurt workers, consumers and our public services.

Supporters of teams in the top two divisions have been banned from standing at games since Lord Taylor\u0027s report into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster - in which 96 Liverpool fans died. But calls have been growing for restrictions to be eased to boost atmosphere. Critics of the current rules point out many fans simply stand anyway and there are hopes a change could bring down spiralling ticket costs. Labour today unveiled a new policy to let clubs, fans and safety authorities decide. Shadow Sports Minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: “Clubs, fans and local authorities know their stadium far better than anybody in Whitehall - the decision should rest with them.  This is about safety the current system isn\u0027t working, people are standing in unsafe seated areas and accidents can happen.  Labour\u0027s backing comes days after it emerged the government had begun talks with the Premier League and EFL over the possibility.  MPs will debate safe standing on 25 June after more than 100,000 fans called for the move in a petition. Labour\u0027s plan would cap the number of safe standing places at 7,500 per stadium, in line with Football League proposals. Ms Allin-Khan announced the policy after visiting Liverpool and holding private meetings with Hillsborough families, who are still split on whether to bring back standing.

Alexandra Quadrelli sculpted the \u0027ultimate revenge body\u0027 after being called fat by her ex, who she claims cheated on her multiple times. The 29-year-old from Perth, Australia, was paranoid her partner would leave her when she bulged to 15st 6oz - about 98kg - after getting the contraceptive implant. Fearing her current partner would stop finding her attractive and battling depression because she hated her appearance, she started taking 123Diet Drops and a clean eating plan. In under four months the deli assistant, originally from Milan, Italy, shed a whopping five stone - more than 31kg - from sticking to the plan without exercising. Alexandra said: Before I felt bad, frustrated, ugly, unhappy and unhealthy. I constantly had the fear of going out and having a social life because I was scared others would judge me.  My life was constantly hiding my body under large clothing, I hid myself from everyone. I always loved going to the beach but when I was a heavier weight, I was too shy to wear a swimsuit or to go shopping because I was frustrated that there weren\u0027t suitable clothes for me. I was unhealthy, unhappy and I was so scared of losing my actual boyfriend because an ex-boyfriend was so rude to me, always cheated on me and would regularly tell me how fat I was.  So I told myself no, not this time. I started to take better care of myself because my health is more important and secondly, because I wanted my boyfriend look at me in different way. Now, I love my body, feel sexy and better about myself but more important than anything else, I\u0027m healthy. I love myself more and my boyfriend sees me in a whole new way. I will always be grateful to 123Diet.  Now I have a revenge body for all the people who are discriminated against their weight I have a revenge body for my ex-boyfriend who was humiliated because of my appearance and to show myself I can do anything. Alexandra says she never struggled with weight problems in the past, until having a contraceptive implant and the stresses of moving to Australia three years ago. This led her to hit her heaviest weight when she had a BMI of 34.9.

Spanish police took the man into custody when Easyjet flight EZY6089, from Bristol to Mahon, Menorca, touched down on the runway on Tuesday, June 5. Easyjet said the man behaved in a disruptive manner on board the flight after he had been drinking his own alcohol that had been purchased at Bristol Airport. A spokesperson told BristolLive the budget airline has been lobbying for a ban on the consumption of duty free alcohol on board flights for a long time.   EasyJet Prague stag-do party members \u0027abused staff, swore in front of kids and URINATED on toilet floor\u0027 before flight cancelled  The spokesperson said: Typically it is the alcohol consumed and/or bought in the airport that is the major causal factor of disruption in the air and so we strongly believe that two simple regulatory changes need to be made. First, licensing laws need to be introduced at airports to control the sale of alcohol, bringing airports into line with bars and restaurants on the high, and secondly the consumption of duty free alcohol on-board should be made illegal. The vast majority of passengers who consume alcohol in the airport or on board do so responsibly and we believe that these two measures would protect their interests while reducing the number of disruptive incidents and making flying safer and more enjoyable for all.  A flight from Bristol to Prague was cancelled earlier in the week after a group of men on a stag do treated the plane like a nightclub, as well as adverse weather conditions. An Avon and Somerset Constabulary spokesperson told BristolLive the men were taken off the flight. One member of the group, a 32-year-old man, was later arrested for a public order offence. A witness described their behaviour as digraceful and claimed the group had abused staff on board and urinated on the floor of the front toilet. Members of the stag group reportedly said the cabin crew overreacted and called for them to be sacked following the incident.

Scots are claiming it\u0027s the worst year ever so far for the presence of the ravenous flies in the country. Scott Sweeney, from Inveraray, Argyll and Bute, works outdoors as a deer manager says the midges make it difficult to get any work done. The 31-year-old shared a shocking video clip of hundreds of tiny midges clinging to his hands and buzzing around him as he sat on a hill with his dog Leah. The post gathered more than 1,400 likes and was shared at least 1,200 times as Scots warned each other to be prepared when hitting the outdoors.  Scott said: I would say the midges are worse than ever this year. They maybe started later as the winter lingered on a bit, but now they have arrived they have just exploded the last few weeks. He added: They are always bad, but I don\u0027t think I have ever seen this before in my life. They may well calm off, but at this exact moment, they are the worst ever. They may have arrived a little bit later due to an unusually cold start this year, but midges are back with a boom and terrorising Scots. Lucy Fraser, from Rowardennan, Stirling, says she has become a prisoner in her own home and revealed that a contractor was forced to stop laying new decking at her property because the midges were so bad. Dr Alison Blackwell, from the Scottish Midge Forecast, backed the claims and said that despite the slowest start to the midge season in three years - midge spray has been flying off the shelves this week as they reemerge.  Midges typically begin to come out during the end of May, and in June the female biting midges arrive to kick off the season. In 2017 a record number of 68 million midges descended on Scotland - a 40% rise on the year before - but experts have not revealed this years\u0027 estimated figures yet. However, Scots across the country have taken to social media to share their midge misery. Lucy Fraser runs her home as guest house for walkers taking on the West Highland way and has to give them a stern warning not to open the windows - or suffer the consequences. The 57-year-old posted a photograph of midges infiltrating a lamp outside of her home. In the space of last week hundreds of the tiny critters filled up the glass case almost to the halfway point. The hotelier said: I insist the guests don\u0027t open the windows. If they do it\u0027s horrific and believe me some do and regret it. Each year from the end of May to October I become a prisoner and wouldn\u0027t dare go out the door before 10am and after 5pm. This is when the midge is at its worst, the sun keeps them away but the rain attracts them. I\u0027ve been here 22 years and it gets worse every year.  The mum-of-eight added: Trying to get tradesmen to work here between May and October is impossible as no one could work outdoors without being driven insane. I\u0027m trying to have a deck area built and the guys said they have never seen anything as bad and even though I gave them a huge fan they said they had to abort the job. I\u0027ve known these guys many years and they have done lots of work but just couldn\u0027t cope this year. They said it\u0027s first time ever he\u0027s had to leave a job due to midges. Social media users were quick to share their shock at the state of the midges already. Lynn Bindon said: A zombie apocalypse has nothing on Scotland\u0027s midge season. Stay safe people.

The exact details of Harry and Meghan\u0027s honeymoon are still unknown but it\u0027s believed they stayed in a luxurious cabin a national park in Canada before jetting to Ireland for a visit to Ashford Castle .  Rumours earlier this week suggested the royal couple had checked into the 13th century castle in Cong, County Mayo on Ireland\u0027s west coast. Rooms cost between \u0026pound600 and \u0026pound4,000 a night and those in the are tweeted that the castle was on lockdown because of the special visitors. Rachel Forde tweeted: The first time I go to Ashford Castle and we couldn\u0027t get into the [actual] castle and around it because the royals are within.

The 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May, which if left untreated can cause blindness. In recent weeks, the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties. The Queen was reportedly treated as a day patient at the private King Edward VII\u0027s hospital in London. When approached, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: I can confirm that the Queen successfully underwent a short planned procedure to treat a cataract last month.  Cataracts are when the lens, a small transparent disc inside the eye, develops cloudy patches. Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated. Despite her recent surgery, it was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements. The Queen is known for her robust health. Her son the Duke of York once described her as being incredibly fit for her age, and the 92-year-old monarch still rides her Fell ponies at Windsor, and drives, mainly around her private estates.  The Queen\u0027s no fuss approach to injury and illness was perfectly illustrated in 1994. She broke her left wrist when her horse tripped during a ride on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The break was not diagnosed until almost 24 hours later when her arm was X-rayed and set in plaster at a hospital. It was the first time she had fallen in many years and the Queen had simply brushed herself down, remounted her horse and trotted on back to Sandringham. She has since called time on her overseas travels, leaving long-haul destinations to the younger members of her family. But she still has a busy diary of events, and in 2017 carried out 296 engagements.

From children\u0027s author Roald Dahl to film director Alfred Hitchcock, 277 people declined the Queen\u0027s Honours in the New Year or Birthday Honours lists from 1951 to 1999, the Cabinet Office confirmed in 2012. Since that official list of those who had declined honours were first published, it has become increasingly common for celebs to reveal their refusal. Before that, it had been relatively rare to do so. While people have explained their decision to turn down honours in many different ways, a number have cited the honours system’s links to empire. How do you refuse an honour? Nominees are asked by Downing Street if they will accept well in advance, and are usually able to reject the offer without going public. Several personalities said a polite ‘no’ to the Queen on more than one occasion. So who exactly has turned down the Birthday Honours, here we take a look at the big names who have rejected the award. Who has refused Birthday Honours? Back in 2003, a list of living celebs who had refused gongs had been leaked, including David Bowie and Helen Mirren (though she later accepted a damehood). French and Saunders  The comedy pairing turned down OBEs for services to comedy drama in 2001. It was only later they explained. Saunders said: “If I felt I deserved a Damehood I’d accept it,” she told Source magazine. “At the time, we felt that we were being paid very well to have a lot of fun. It didn’t seem right somehow. “We didn’t deserve a pat on the back. It felt a bit fake to stand alongside people who devoted their lives to truly worthy causes.” David Bowie  Bowie himself later explained his decision not to join the list of musical knights including Sir Mick Jagger, Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. He said: “I would never have any intention of accepting anything like that. I seriously don’t know what it’s for. It’s not what I spent my life working for.” When asked about Jagger accepting the honour, he said: “It’s not my place to make a judgment on Jagger, it’s his decision. But it’s just not for me.” Nigella Lawson  The celeb chef turned down the offer of an OBE in 2001, though it\u0027s not known why. Benjamin Zephaniah Poet Benjamin Zephaniah explained his public refusal in 2003. He wrote: “OBE, me? Up yours, I thought. I get angry when I hear that word ‘empire’: it reminds me of slavery, thousands of years of brutality.” “I am not one of those who are obsessed with their roots, and I’m certainly not suffering from a crisis of identity my obsession is about the future and the political rights of all people. “Benjamin Zephaniah OBE - no way Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.” Stephen Hawking  In 2008 Hawking said he had been approached with an offer of a knighthood in the late 1990s, but had turned it down. It was later said it was down to the government\u0027s dealing with science funding and cuts. Paul Weller The musician rejected his CBE in 2006. In a statement his spokesperson said: “Paul was surprised and flattered, but it wasn’t really for him.” Lynn Faulds Wood In 2016, former BBC watchdog presenter Lynn Faulds Wood turned down an MBE and suggested that the honours system needs updating to reflect the modern world. She said: “I would love an honour if it didn’t have the word ‘empire’ at the end of it. We don’t have an empire.” John Cleese  The Monty Python star was offered a CBE in 1996 but said they were silly. He was offered a peerage by Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown in 1999 - he declined because he felt staying in England during the winter months to fulfil his role as a working peer was too much of a price to pay. George Harrison The former Beatle turned an OBE down in 2000 - after Paul McCartnery was awarded a knighthood. Every Beatles member was awarded an MBE in 1965, though Lennon returned him. It\u0027s thought he was put forward for his contribution to music, but there was speculation that Harrison would have been insulted that McCartney got his knighthood three years before. “Whoever it was who decided to offer him the OBE and not the knighthood was extraordinarily insensitive,” friend Roy Connolly told the Independent. “George would have felt insulted – and with very good reason.” Ken Loach Ken Loach turned down an OBE in 1977. His films focus on social issues such as poverty and homlessness. He told the Radio Times in 2001. “It’s all the things I think are despicable: patronage, deferring to the monarchy and the name of the British Empire, which is a monument of exploitation and conquest. “I turned down the OBE because it’s not a club you want to join when you look at the villains who’ve got it.” Howard Gayle  Howard Gayle, Liverpool FC’s first black player, also turned down an MBE, saying it would be a \u0027betrayal’ of Africans who suffered as a result of the empire and that his “ancestors would be turning in their graves.” He was nominated for his work with Show Racism the Red Card. Taking to Facebook he said: “This is a decision that I have had to make and there will be others who may feel different and would enjoy the attraction of being a Member of the British Empire and those 3 letters after their name, but I feel that It would be a betrayal to all of the Africans who have lost their lives, or who have suffered as a result of Empire.” Jon Snow  Having declined an OBE in 2000, Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow went on to make a documentary in 2002 entitled ‘Secrets of the Honours System’. He remains critical of the use of ‘Empire’ in our honours system. “I tried to find out why I’d been given it and was unable to get a clear answer or, indeed, to find out who had proposed me, he said afterwards. Alan Bennett Alan turned down the offer of a CBE in 1988 and rejected a knighthood in 1996. The author and playwright said the reason was he couldn\u0027t carry off being a knight. “I felt that, in my case, it just wouldn’t suit me, that’s all. It would be like wearing a suit every day of your life.” Jim Broadbent Jim Broadbent was offered an OBE but he turned it down as he felt it should go to those who help others. In 2012 he said: “I was offered an OBE a couple of years ago, but I said, ‘no’, and turned it down.” “I’m not that comfortable with actors receiving honours, partly because I think they ought to go to those who really help others, he told the . “Besides, I like the idea of actors not being part of the Establishment. “We’re vagabonds and rogues, and we’re not a part of the authorities and Establishment, really. If you mix the two together, things get blurry.” LS Lowry  Lowry declined five honours – an OBE in 1955, CBE in 61, knighthood in 68 and invitations to be a Companion of Honour in 1972 and 76. Friend and fellow artist Harold Riley said when the list was revealed in 2012 that the painter did not have “anything against the system”. He said: “He indicated he didn’t wish to change his situation by something being latched on to him.” Riley said Lowry was a “very private person” and may have wanted to protect his privacy. Danny Boyle Danny Boyle, director and man behind the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, turned down an honour because he thought it was was wrong. It\u0027s just not me, he said. He added thousands were involved in executing the ceremony. “You can make these speeches about ‘this is everybody’s work, blah blah blah’, he said. “And you’ve got to mean it, and I did mean it, and it is true, and it’s the only way you can carry on something like that: through the efforts of all the people. “I don’t know whether I’ll ever get invited back to the Palace.” Aldous Huxley Aldous Huxley, author of classic novel Brave New World, snubbed a knighthood in 1959. Evelyn Waugh Evelyn Waugh, who wrote Brideshead Revisited among other famous titles, refused a CBE in the same year. Roald Dahl  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory author Roald Dahl rejected an OBE in the 1986 New Year’s Honours. Trevor Howard The actor Trevor Howard, star of romance Brief Encounter, would not accept a CBE in 1982. In 1979 the Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan’s wife Audrey refused to be made a Dame. It was the year Mr Callaghan led Labour to defeat against Margaret Thatcher’s Tories. However, Mrs Callaghan later acquired a title when her husband became a peer in 1987. Hughie Green The Opportunity Knocks star Hughie Green refused an OBE in the 1960 New Year’s Honours, when he was at the height of his fame as presenter of Double Your Money. Michael Frayn Author and playwright Michael Frayn turned down a knighthood in 2003, and a CBE in 1999, for a simple reason. He said: “I haven’t done this for reasons of modesty. I like the name Michael Frayn it’s a nice little name to run around with. I’ve spent 70 years getting used to it and I don’t want to change it now.” Ian McDiarmid Ian, known for playing Palpatine in Star Wars, turned down an OBE, but it\u0027s not know why. Prime Ministers  Former Prime Ministers Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have all declined life peerages. Sir Winston Churchill reportedly declined being created Duke of London because he wished to remain in the House of Commons. Stars who refused an award - but later accepted them  Psycho and The Birds director Hitchcock turned down a CBE in 1962, but accepted a knighthood just before he died. Sculptor Henry Moore, the son of a coal miner, refused a knighthood in 1951, but became a Companion of Honour in 1955. Conversely actor Robert Morley, who accepted an OBE in 1957, rejected a knighthood in the 1975 Birthday Honours list. And Hugh Cudlipp, who edited The Daily Mirror in the 50s and 60s turned down a knighthood in 1966, although he had accepted an OBE in 1945. Artist Lucian Freud declined a CBE in 1977 but went to Downing Street to paint the Queen’s portrait.  Poet Philip Larkin refused an OBE in 1968. Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick turned down a CBE in 1963, before accepting the Order of Merit in 1991. Lenny Henry accepted a CBE from Tony Blair but refused an honour from John Major.

Pearl Fernandez, 34, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole while her boyfriend Isauro Aguirre, 37, was sentenced to death for the death of her son Gabriel.  The pair bit, whipped and beat little Gabriel Fernandez in catalogue of horrific attacks at their home in Palmdale, California.  In the months leading up to his death, Gabriel was covered with pepper spray, forced to eat his own vomit, regularly gagged to stop him from speaking and locked in a cabinet when he complained, the court heard.  Fernandez and Isauro also burned him with cigarettes, whipped him, shot him with a BB gun, starved him and fed him cat litter. The boy was kept gagged and bound in a cubby until he was found, a Los Angeles County District Attorney\u0027s Office heard. Before reading their sentences, Judge George G. Lomeli said their conduct was horrendous, inhumane and nothing short of evil.  You want to say that the conduct was animalistic, but that would be wrong because even animals know how to take care of their young, some to the extent that they would sacrifice their own lives in caring for their young, Lomeli said as he stared directly toward Fernandez and Aguirre in the court room, reports ABC .  He then told a touching story of a news report he once watched about a mother cat who kept going into burning building to save her kittens.  Judge Lomeli continued: I can only wish...that in the middle of the night you wake up, and you think of the injuries that you subjected on this poor young man, this poor 7-year-old, and that it tortures you. Last December, the jury recommended that Aguirre be sentence to death after he was convicted of first-degree murder and the special circumstance allegation of murder involving torture. In February, Fernandez pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and admitted to the torture special circumstance allegation in order to get life in prison without parole. If the case had gone to trial and she had been convicted as charged, she would have also been facing the death penalty.  At her sentencing hearing, Fernandez read an apology letter out loud, saying she hopes one day her children can forgive her.   I want to say I\u0027m sorry for what happened. I wish Gabriel was alive. Every day I wish that I\u0027d made better choices. I\u0027m sorry to my children, and I want them to know that I love them, she said.   Gabriel\u0027s brother Ezequiel, who was 12 at the time and is now aged 16, and sister Virginia, who was 11 at the time and is now aged 14, gave heartbreaking evidence last year. Ezequiel said Aguirre would punch and kick the boy and pick him up by the neck until he passed out. The court went silent as a cabinet recovered from the home was rolled in. Ezequiel said the couple nicknamed it \u0027the box\u0027 and would handcuff Gabriel inside for hours on end without food or water. He also saw Aguirre beat Gabriel with a buckle and metal hanger while he was naked. He said his mum and Aguirre would often laugh as they beat the boy together, calling him gay.

The guinea pigs will be paid about $3,500 (\u0026pound2619.72) for deliberately allowing their bodies to be challenged to see if they get ill.  And they would be quarantined for 10 days in \u0027Hotel Influenza,\u0027 a converted 24-room suite at Saint Louis University, Missouri, US.  Communal areas in the accommodation have comfortable sofas and spaces to socialise, watch TV and read, and exercise equipment is available. The experience is also catered with meals offered in the dining room.   Daniel Hoft, director of SLU’s Center for Vaccine Development, said: The Extended Stay Research Unit will allow SLU to take its vaccine research to the next level. SLU has invested in this because it is an important way to potentially contribute significantly to the development of a universal flu vaccine, he added.  Human challenge studies are a way to get a lot of information quicker, with a smaller number of volunteers and less cost than a traditional vaccine study. In a traditional flu study, we vaccinate people and see if their immune systems respond by creating antibodies that fight flu.  In a human challenge study, we vaccinate people, then deliberately challenge their bodies by exposing them to flu to see if they get sick.”  Volunteers as part of this challenge would be given a vaccine or placebo, then intentionally exposed to a strain of the influenza virus. In the 10 days that follow, they are observed closely with blood and lung tests and nose swabs to see if they are infected with the virus and shedding it through bodily secretions.  Nurses are on hand constantly to care for them. And participants are not allowed to go home until show they are negative for infection for two days. The reason they\u0027re quarantined is because it takes time for symptoms to develop and the contagious period to be over.  There is a \u0027clean room\u0027 in the \u0027hotel\u0027 with work spaces for non-volunteers who come and go into the unit.

Vibrator owners in the UK are being warned that they should check laws abroad before travelling as vibrators are banned in some countries. Places such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Maldives have a ban on sex toys and anyone bringing one in to the country would be forced to face the authorities. Sex toy specialists Carvaka have urged people to get all the facts before going away.  They said: We know how much people get attached to their sex toys and so when it comes to heading off on holidays, it can be difficult to think about a week or even a fortnight away from them. However, with a number of countries imposing outright bans on vibrators and dildos, it\u0027s important that people are informed before they travel in order to prevent any issues at the point of entry to that country. Countries where sex toys are banned  1. The Maldives While us Brits may love a trip to the Maldives, basking on expanses of white sand and exploring blue lagoons, a holiday there could end badly if you pack a sex toy in your suitcase. They come under the heading of pornographic material which is completely banned by the Maldives Customs Service.  2. Saudi Arabia Sex toys also fall under the category of pornographic material in Saudi Arabia and could be confiscated.  Supposedly even massagers which look immoral are banned. 3. Malaysia The Malaysian Penal Code states that anyone who sells, distributes or possesses an obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure, or any other obscene object whatsover... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. 4. The United Arab Emirates While the UAE is filled with impressive skyscrapers and beach resorts, it would be difficult to find a sex toy as they are prohibited.  Gulf news reported in 2010 that a woman was stopped after her child\u0027s phallic swimming aid was mistaken for a sex toy.

Father\u0027s Day began around 100 years ago over in the US and has since made its mark all over the world. Best Father\u0027s Day gift ideas for 2018: From budget presents under \u0026pound30 to top luxury and personalised gifts How did Father\u0027s Day begin? The exact origin has been disputed. Most believe it began with Sonora Dodd, from Washington, who came up with the idea after hearing the Mother\u0027s Day sermon in 1910 and thinking (not without good reason) why the dads didn\u0027t have their own day too. She and her siblings had been raised by their father after their mum died in childbirth. Dodd began a campaign...and well, the rest is history. Other people argue it was Grace Golden Clayton from West Virginia, who suggested celebrating the day in 1908. She apparently put the suggestion forward after a mine explosion in a nearby town killed more than 360 men - the idea being it was a day for children to remember their fathers. Whatever the reason, we\u0027re glad of it.  How is it celebrated around the world? We know what the traditions are in the UK, but what about abroad? In Germany it\u0027s called Vatertag or Mannertag (or men\u0027s day). It\u0027s traditional in some places for men to go into the woods with a wagon of beer, wine and meats. In China it\u0027s marked on the 8th August because eight in Chinese is \u0027ba\u0027 and a colloquial way of saying father is \u0027ba-ba\u0027 - so eighth day of the eighth month sounds like father.

Ms Kenyon, who was living with her grandmother at the time, subsequently blocked Tosh’s number.The court was told Ms McVicar received an abusive video message from Tosh on January 19, described as “rambling.”Both women were upset by this, and contacted police.The court heard the messages had been intended to be “a joke”, but Tosh “appreciated this was not how it came across”.He admitted that on various occasions between January 15 and 19, he sent grossly offensive text messages to Ms Kenyon which were indecent, obscene or menacing in character in that he repeatedly referred to her in offensive and abusive terms and threatened to expose intimate photographs of her.He further admitted that he sent text and video messages to Ms McVicar that were grossly offensive or indecent, obscene or menacing in character, shouted, swore and used offensive and abusive language.Sheriff John Rafferty said: “You have two recently analogous matters on your record in 2012 and 2013.“You have also breached bail opportunities on six occasions.

constantly people coming around the house, other people from the opera would all come around, drink some wine and sing some songs,\u0026#8221 he said.\u0026#8220It was mainly classical music that I was interested in when I was very very young.\u0026#8220If there was ever any children\u0026#8217s parts, me and my sister would get dressed up and thrown on stage, I sure to enjoy that.\u0026#8220There was never much singing involved, it was mostly just being children running around on stage.\u0026#8221Tristan said he started playing the cornet when he was four or five, and then moved on to the baritone horn while he was a student at Grange Primary School in Monifieth.\u0026#8220But I always wanted to play the trombone and they didn\u0026#8217t have one in the music

their list of targets.Both are free agents, though, the Tangerines face a battle to land either signature.Etxabeguren was released by the Dark Blues last month after an injury-hit year and has returned to Spain.Whether he can be enticed back to Scotland remains to be seen, although, he did enjoy his time in Dundee.Morris, meanwhile, told Dunfermline he was leaving them to return to England but a move back to former club United might be enough for him to shelve those plans.The 28-year-old played 45 times for Jackie McNamara at Tannadice over two seasons but, like Etxabeguren, has a history of injuries.He did play 40 games last season for the Pars, however.Also on the list is former Partick man Frederic Frans.The Belgian centre-back is wanted by his former club also, as well as fellow-Championship side Ross County.Meanwhile, United have announced their first pre-season friendly.Csaba Laszlo’s men will head to Brechin City on Tuesday, July 3, kick-off 7.45pm.That sees both

of Romanian agent Ioan Becali and stressed in an ad-hoc TV interview he wasn’t looking at players, just enjoying his time off.Kamara, meanwhile, despite only joining up with the Finnish national squad

Cristean Manea’s 37th-minute strike.In the second period, Kamara made his entrance after 57 minutes for Nottingham Forest’s Thomas Lam but almost immediately the team fell further behind.On 61 minutes, winger Ciprian Deac finished from close range to give the Romanians a home victory.Finland boss Markku Kanerva said: “The start was challenging but we looked good. We fought well and did not give up.“Of course, we should not be satisfied with this result but we did not have a full squad.“At the end, we got a little bit to attack more.“I had to think a little about the team when Pyry Soiri and Glen Kamara were only involved on Monday for the first time so they only played the second period.“There was little to be done in the last third.

We would fully expect this to be appropriate to the scale and seriousness of the unauthorised works undertaken.”In his report Mike Galloway, executive director of city development, lays out the arguments for and against the three possible options.The report notes that: “The unauthorised demolition of a Listed Building is a significant breach of National Legislation as reinforced through the comments by Historic Environment Scotland. Taking no further action is not considered to be an appropriate response”.Under consideration of serving an Enforcement Notice the report says it would not be an appropriate course of action because the building: “…has now been completely demolished and materials removed from the site”. Any restoration would not be reasonably practicable.When looking at whether to recommend reporting the matter to the Procurator Fiscal Mr Galloway’s report says: “There was frequent correspondence between council officers and the owner’s representatives late in 2017.“The information that was provided by the owner’s representatives, in the opinion of Dundee City Council engineers, clearly confirmed that while defects were present, demolition was not the only option to preserve safety or indeed the building.”It goes on: “Given the nature and the lack of notification or contact with Dundee City Council prior to the commencement of the demolition process, it is considered that this displays a disregard for the statutory process.”The report therefore recommends that Dundee City Council reports the matter to the Procurator Fiscal.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"promising signs as csaba laszlo begins to create new dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe summer of change at Tannadice has only just begun but the new-look Dundee United side is starting to take shape – what kind of shape are they in exactly, though?So far, the Tangerines have decimated last season’s pool with almost a full matchday squad list heading out the door.That left them with a skeleton squad before their business really got started last week.Five faces are in the door with the few players manager Csaba Laszlo wanted to keep given new contracts.More will be coming in during the next few weeks but, right now, how are they shaping up?GoalkeeperDeniz Mehmet looked certain to be the man between the sticks this season but for his knee injury picked up at the end of last season.With Harry Lewis heading back to Southampton after his loan, highly-rated youth keeper Josh Donaldson is the only fit goalie at the club.Verdict: A goalkeeper is certainly on the shopping list.DefenceTwo defenders have been brought in already this summer in Sam Wardrop and Callum Booth.Booth is expected to be first choice at left-back ahead of Jamie Robson while Wardrop will battle it out with Stewart Murdoch on the right.Though Murdoch has slotted in at centre-half, there is a big gap to be filled in that position.William Edjenguele, Tam Scobbie and Lewis Toshney are still around but Csaba and head scout Paul Sturrock are certainly looking for two starting centre-backs.Verdict: Big gap to fill in the middle but full-back positions look solid.MidfieldFit and healthy, Dundee United’s central midfield places are pretty much sewn up.Fraser Fyvie and Sam Stanton are the club’s stand-out talents at the moment and will occupy the middle of the park without doubt when available.In reserve is Scott Allardice after he signed a new one-year deal.Out wide, Fraser Aird has been brought in to play on the left side while Billy King is likely to start on the right.Paul McMullan hasn’t always been Csaba’s cup of tea but showed at the start of last season how effective he can be from the wings while youngster Matty Smith has slotted in out wide at times, though is nominally a striker.Verdict: Centre is strong when fit but numbers needed for a long season.AttackThe biggest capture so far by the Tangerines has been striker Nicky Clark coming from Dunfermline on a free transfer.The former Queen of the South and Rangers man has scored 29 goals in his last 62 matches in the Championship and is tasked with being Csaba’s main goal threat.Also in is former Ross County striker Craig Curran.The battling forward has never been prolific but his job will be to provide ammunition for Clark, while knocking in a few himself.James Keatings, too, is still around at Tannadice after a season beset by injury and personal problems. He’ll seem like a new signing if he can rediscover the form that helped Hamilton, Hearts and Hibs gain promotion to the top flight.Verdict: Looking good up top.Overall: With just 18 first-team players on the books, work is obviously still to be done but initial signs look promising. Adding solid defenders, however, is vital.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Camera shy couples snapping up new smartphone wedding service in Glasgow","story":"                          BRIDES on a budget and eloping couples are snapping up deals with a new wedding photography business where the pictures are all shot using a smartphone."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7891061.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  The council chief who approved   235K Rolls Royce gift for Lord Provost","story":"                          By Alan Ferguson and Stewart Paterson"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7891181.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  Complete setlist for Jay-Z and Beyonc   ahead of Glasgow gig","story":"                          THE setlist for Jay-Z and Beyonc\u0026eacute\u0027 first gig of their UK tour has been unveiled."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7891710.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Revealed  Ed Sheeran and Anne-Marie s flying visit to popular Glasgow bar","story":"                          ED SHEERAN played three nights at Hampden Park but nobody knew he played for real on his final night right outside the Evening Times HQ.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7823436.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Marks   Spencer to close popular Glasgow City Centre branch","story":"                          RETAILER Marks \u0026amp Spencer will close one of their food outlets in Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7892436.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"First look at the full-scale sets when massive Friends tour comes to Glasgow","story":"                          THESE images show what Friends fans can expect when the massive UK tour of the hit comedy show hits Glasgow in a month\u0027 time."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7893060.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=94\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"West End streets in lockdown as runners prepare for a sizzling Women s 10k","story":"                          RUNNERS taking part in this weekend\u0027 women\u0027 10k in Glasgow are being advised to prepare for a warm race."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7893414.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"SNP conference marks new push for independence says Nicola Sturgeon","story":"                          THE SNP conference over the next two days marks the start of a new push towards independence, according to Nicola Sturgeon."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7699093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Made in Chelsea star celebrates reopening of Glasgow clinic","story":"                          PARENTS-TO-BE Vogue Williams and Spencer Matthews touched down in Scotland ahead of their rumoured Scottish nuptials."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7896334.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ultimate gin festival with unlimited tastings coming to Glasgow","story":"                          THE ultimate gin festival with unlimited tastings has been lined up to hit Glasgow."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7897782.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":" Get ready for a second vote   New SNP depute s message to Scottish independence supporters","story":"                          New SNP depute leader Keith Brown has called on independence supporters to \"get ready\" for a second vote on Scotland\u0027s future."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7899051.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Britain  39 s most overpriced property  Tiny   39 rabbit hutch  39  house with just two rooms sells for whopping amount","story":"                          A \u0027RABBIT hutch\u0027 house with just two rooms has sold for a whopping \u0026pound280,000 -

We\u0026rsquove got the most roads and schools and most of them in the poorest condition. That\u0027 nobody\u0027 fault, that\u0027 our geography.\"She expected both governments to insist that grant support has risen year on year \u0026ndash something the council has consistently disputed.A spokeswoman for the Scottish Government said: \"Highland Council has had more money this year from the Scottish Government despite UK government cuts to our budget.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

Yet we remain true to our roots as an agricultural show and work hard to be truly relevant to all aspects of farming and rural life.\u0026#8216The Grand Parade always proves to be a high point of the show and gives us a chance to celebrate the commitment and dedication of all our cattle and heavy horse exhibitors.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr uniteds ian mccall lawrence","story":"NewsAyr United\u0027s Ian McCall and Lawrence Shankland bag Ladbrokes awardsIt comes after Ayr United won the League One title, with an impressive 124 goals in all competitions.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet15:23, 9 MAY 2018NewsAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland win the Ladbrokes League 1 Manager and Player of the Year awards (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United manager Ian McCall and striker Lawrence Shankland have bagged an awards double.

The ‘Highway Services’ would be located at Bogend Toll near Symington and could create 30 jobs. A Shell petrol station and Londis shop are part of the vision for the site. A raft of documents have been lodged with South Ayrshire Council as part of a planning application. London-based Grove Garages is behind the proposal, which would see two buildings erected.   The company has an agreement with Shell and Londis but is still in talks to sign-up a coffee firm.  The plan includes eight fuel pumps, 11 parking spaces, two car wash bays and pumps for HGVs.  The coffee shop would have a floor space of 260sqm with 29 car spaces and a drive through at the back. A supporting statement said: “The location of the site represents an ideal opportunity for a roadside servies area to cater for the frequent tourist, haulage and commuter traffic using the A77. It said the development would ensure the “reuse of a visually and environmentally poor site in a prominent location alongside one of Scotland’s main tourist routes, the A77.”  The site used to be a field belonging to Dyke Farm. Access to the site would be from the B730 adjoining the A77 north bound carriageway. Cars could enter from the southbound carriageway through the existing flyover. Chargers would also be available for electric cars. A design and access statement said: “The proposals give back purpose to an unused site, which has potential to provide an important service to the local area and indeed the wider area. The design proposals are considered to be respectful to the local environment and are in line with local policy and guidelines. No decision has been made on the application yet.

Following a long battle with neuroblastoma, the 17-year-old died peacefully surrounded by dad Chris, mum Connie, and sister Olivia. It was a fight that captured not just the hearts and minds of Ayrshire, but the world beyond. Vanessa, who displayed courage which belied her condition, would rarely be seen without a smile on her face. For almost a decade, her name became synonymous with the fight against the aggressive cancer. Almost \u0026pound1million was raised with the aim of sending Vanessa abroad for life-saving treatment. That dream was realised and in January 2013, the family received the news they longed for – that the cancer was in remission.  Vanessa would return to school and rejoin classmates as a hugely popular figure at Marr College. Life, as normal as it could ever be, was good again for this inspirational girl. But the cancer would return and spread to Vanessa’s brain, with her family receiving the crushing news that her condition was terminal. As ever, Vanessa fought bravely until the last before she passed away just days short of her 18th birthday. Now her family are vowing that her fight will live on in her legacy. Dad Chris told the Post: “We are devastated at our loss.  “Vanessa was a huge inspiration to Connie, Olivia and I and so many more. “She achieved lots during her short but fulfilled life, she did everything she wanted to do and lived life to the full. “She never complained about anything, even though her situation was dire and she knew it. “We are privileged to have had such an inspirational and beautiful daughter.”  Vanessa’s funeral will take place on Friday, June 22 at 11.30am at Dreghorn Crematorium and then on to Troon Town Hall for a Celebration of Life. Chris added: “We’d like to ask that people wear bright colours and for the gents not to wear black ties. “That is what Vanessa would have wanted.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United. The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

The pair lost touch over the years but were reunited six years ago. Kim said: “We started chatting as friends but it became apparent the spark was definitely still there between us and a few months later we moved in together. “It was a whirlwind romance - within a year of meeting we had moved in together, got engaged and had a beautiful baby boy.  “We then had another baby in 2016 and it was then we decided to start planning the wedding.” The couple tied the knot at The Vu in Bathgate on Mother’s Day, March 11 this year. Kim said: “We were a bit panicky about the weather as the week before the wedding was storm Edna and everyone was snowed in. “There was still some snow lying around on the wedding day but the sun was shining. “The wedding day was an emotional day from start to finish it was full of tears and laughter and genuinely was the best day of our lives!” The bride wore a Maggie Sottero ‘Lisette’ dress from Opus Couture in West Kilbride, as well as veil and hair piece. The kilts were from MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick.

The 20-year-old from Prestwick, who is number one in the world for his tennis category, made it to the top of the 2867ft peak on Arran. Dominic was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, which is on the autism spectrum, at a young age and is part of the Great Britain Learning Disability tennis team. After three years in the sport, he is number one in the world for his doubles category and number three in the world for singles. He competes in the mainstream tennis ranks and is in the top 10 for the South/West Scotland overall. He is currently part of an apprenticeship at Prestwick Tennis Fitness Club and is close to achieving his level three coaching badges that would allow him to coach anywhere in the world. Dominic’s dad, Anthony, who runs the Iannotti Bros cash and carry, could not be more proud of him. The 50-year-old, from Prestwick, said: “Dominic was diagnosed at a young age. We tried all kinds of things but nothing seemed to help. “My wife went online and found children’s charity Bibic and we spoke to them. They were a godsend and they guided us and helped Dominic through a lot.    Since then we haven’t looked back and he has became a fantastic kid.  “You would never know he had this syndrome and that’s credit to the hard work done.” Dominic decided to give something back to the charities that have helped him over the years. He climbed Goat Fell with a group of friends and raised \u0026pound810 for Bibic and South Ayrshire Autistic Society. Anthony said: “We are very proud of him. “A lot of people now do fundraising for national charities but the local ones don’t get as much exposure or sponsors. We wanted to help Bibic as they were instrumental in helping the way Dominic is today and SAAS helped Dominic from a very young age.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"thousands pounds pocketed council after","story":"NewsThousands of pounds pocketed by council after secret VAT grabBut they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston14:18, 6 JUN 2018NewsCouncillor Peter Convery brands move on VAT “sleekit”\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThousands of pounds is being pocketed by a council after a secret VAT grab. But they’ve been caught out by golfers incensed South Ayrshire Council has not passed on any benefit of a government zero VAT ruling on leisure. In February HMRC announced there was to be no VAT on council provided leisure activities. And that will include swimming, gym use and bowling at Northfield. But South Ayrshire Council has not let any of its customers know. If effectively means golf charges have soared 24% on last year, rather than the 2.7% the council have boasted about. It means that golfers paying the \u0026pound429 season ticket price would be expecting a \u0026pound71.50 reduction for VAT.  Tory councillor Peter Convery is blasting the move as “sleekit.” And he said: “Surely people are entitled to get some money paid back to them? “This is about principle and this is sleekit. “This is peoples’ money and should never have been included in the original ticket charge. “It is very unfortunate the council cannot see this to any great extent.” In East Ayrshire, where leisure is provided by an arm’s length trust, VAT is necessary on charges. Details of the VAT grab emerged in an email between a golfer and Councillor Brian McGinley.  The golfer, who preferred to remain anonymous, said: “I do not think the majority of season ticket holders will be enamoured to discover that a significant element of their season ticket fee is actually related to a cost that SAC no longer have to bear.” Ayr East councillor McGinley said in the email: “I have ascertained that VAT has been included within the price of a season ticket up until February 18 this year. “Following a court ruling against HMRC whereby sports services provided by local authorities are now classed as exempt for VAT purposes, VAT is no longer remitted to HMRC when income is received for season tickets etc.” A council spokesman would not explain why they had not revealed the VAT windfall, if players can expect a refund or whether is was just being used to mask a huge leap in prices.  He would only say: “We work hard to ensure our golf and leisure provision continues to offer great value for local people and visitors and this is reflected in our current charging structure. “The funding from entry fees and season tickets only makes a partial contribution to our overall operating costs – with the remainder coming directly from Council subsidy – and the 2.7% price increase on last year’s fees reflects the Consumer Price Index. “Reducing inequalities within our communities is a key commitment for the Council and we have extended the concessions available under the Access to Leisure card scheme – which includes a 15% discount for all South Ayrshire residents. The change in VAT application for Council leisure services contributes towards the costs of that important scheme, which will help improve health and wellbeing across South Ayrshire, as well as helping reduce the net deficit cost of running Council leisure services, which was almost \u0026pound11 million in 2016/17.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"troon church help build new","story":"NewsTroon church to help build new school for hurricane victimsThe Troon church has raised £170,000 to help transform people’s lives in Haiti.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley14:28, 7 JUN 2018NewsPastor Richard Woods with Minister Rolex visiting Muirhead Primary (Image: Copyright unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Building a school for hurricane victims was once a dream for Seagate Church.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it. Laird Girdwood, was a larger-than-life character and also one of the prominent proprietors. He was also a member of the Peeblesshire Rifle Volunteers.\nThen as now, such organisations accommodate a little social networking.\nIt is not surprising then that Charles Ker, also a Volunteer and his sister acquired one of these tofts from a comrade. Meanwhile James Ker lived with his wife at Red Lion House in Biggiesknowe. Their toft was more than half an acre in size with a barn whose gable end faced the street and a single-storey cottage attached. Parts of the barn were rebuilt\ninto a new dwelling house.\nThe barn itself is not without interest being the one scene of Laird Girdwood\u0026rsquos Venison Feast to which all the residents of the Northgate were invited everyone, however, to bring his own beverage.\nIt was a resounding success\u0026mdash\u0026ldquoNever before did the rafters ring with such glee. was the reported account of the event.\nA traditional forge and a modern purpose-built engineering workshop were built as well as a \u0026lsquospec\u0026rsquo tenement of four dwellings.\nWrought iron work was much in evidence, with a large garden behind and a rustic rockery at the front of the property. It was then given the name \u0026lsquoKer Place\u0026rsquo after the fashion of the time for such businessmen of which there are several examples in Peebles.\nThe cottage (pre 1823), which is still in place, became part of the enterprise and judging by the size of the lathe bed and fire-scorched rafters some serious work went on there.\nIt also incorporated James Ker\u0026rsquos dispensary for his veterinary work. James had been a student of William Dick at his Edinburgh Veterinary College which he had established at his father\u0026rsquos forge in Clyde Street in Edinburgh where the bus station now stands.\nHe obtained his diploma to practice as a veterinary surgeon and was also made a Fellow of the Edinburgh Medical Veterinary Society for his \u0026ldquovaluable contribution to veterinary science. This may have been in connection with a product he sold commercially as \u0026lsquoKer\u0026rsquos Alterative Sheep Pill\u0026rsquo.\nIt must have been effective since it was still being sold in the 1930s by his son, John Ker. He, also a blacksmith, had qualified as a veterinary surgeon nearly forty years after his father at what was by then called the Royal \u0026ldquoDick Veterinary College.\nJames and his wife died at a young age and his brother and sister, Charles and Elizabeth, carried on the business successfully as well as raising James\u0026rsquos family of two boys.\nJohn Ker, as said, served his apprenticeship as a blacksmith and also qualified as a veterinary surgeon. About 1916 the smiddy closed when the farriers went to war.\nJohn Ker served as a captain with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps and on his return practiced locally as a veterinary surgeon until he died after a short illness towards the end of 1938. The smiddy, itself, \u0026ldquodid its bit during hostilities, by billeting troops.\nIt did not reopen after the war and operate at its former level of business as blacksmiths and engineers. It did, however, remain in general use and is currently a joiner\u0026rsquos workshop.\nJohn Ker was also the last \u0026ldquoBoxmaster (minute secretary) of the Peebles Incorporation of Hammermen\u0026mdashthe blacksmiths\u0026rsquo once exclusive and powerful guild.\nIt fell to him to record in the minutes, rather regretfully, \u0026ldquoThere was no meeting and no dinner held in 1927\u0026mdashfitting, his forebear had been one of the founding signatories we believe. Times had changed, the calling had lost its prosperous and confident ambience, and that was a fact.\nThese events resonate with the story of Black Beauty\u0026rsquos life over a hundred years ago in Victorian England.\nSome of his memories were happy and some were very sad, none less so than those when he meets his old friend Ginger . . .\n"},{"url":null,"title":"40 week one-way system introduced in Jedburgh","story":"A TEMPORARY one-way system has been in introduced in Jedburgh to allow work to be carried out to a privately-owned dangerous building.\nThe new arrangement, which began on Monday (June 4), has seen a section of the High Street become one-way southbound from Jewellers Wynd to Canongate southbound, and a section of Exchange Street one-way northbound from High Street to Friarsgate.\nThis one-way system is required to extend scaffolding onto the road to allow for repairs to be carried out to the building, which has significant structural issues and needs extensive work to make it safe.\nThe disruption is expected to last 40 weeks, and a temporary walkway has also been introduced around the scaffolding to allow pedestrians to still use High Street and Exchange Street.\nSignage is in place to make people aware of the temporary arrangement.\nA joint statement by Jedburgh and District councillors Jim Brown, Scott Hamilton, Sandy Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe High Street dangerous building is a complex and long running issue, but the council is making progress and needs to introduce this temporary one-way system to carry out further repairs.\n\u0026ldquoThe council is looking at various options for the future of the building, and a report is expected to be discussed later this year.\n\u0026ldquoWe thank townsfolk for their patience so far, and would ask they comply with the temporary one-way system.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Borders parking issues working group calls for evidence from public","story":"A CALL for evidence on parking issues in Borders town centres has been issued by Scottish Borders Council\u0026rsquos Parking Issues Working Group.\nThe working group is currently gathering evidence and researching what happens in other local authority areas and will report back to the Executive Committee later this year with recommendations.\nAn online survey has now been launched to give local people and businesses the opportunity to provide evidence of any issues faced in their communities.\nCouncillor Gordon Edgar, Executive Member for Roads and Infrastructure and chair of the working group, said: \u0026ldquoAs part of our evidence gathering we want to hear from people on specific places, days and times when parking is a problem.

cataract","story":"The Queen has had eye surgery to remove a cataract.\nThe 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May.\nIn recent weeks, the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties.\nThe Queen at a garden party on May 31 (Yui Mok/PA)\nThe Press Association learned from a source that the Queen was treated as a day patient at the private King Edward VII\u0026rsquos hospital in London.\nWhen approached, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \u0026ldquoI can confirm that the Queen successfully underwent a short planned procedure to treat a cataract last month.\nIt was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements.\nCataracts are when the lens, a small transparent disc inside the eye, develops cloudy patches.\nOver time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated.\nCataracts are more common in the elderly and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities such as driving.\nA family history of cataracts can increase the risk of developing them.\nThe Queen Mother had an operation to remove a cataract from her left eye in 1995 when she was 95 but, unlike her daughter, she spent a night in King Edward VII\u0026rsquos Hospital after the surgery.\nThe Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution.\nIn 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.\nA week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital.\nShe usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.\nCataract surgery involves replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one.\nIt is the most common operation performed in the UK, with a high success rate in

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"flags fly as putting green opens","story":"There are 18 holes on the seaside green next to the children\u0026#8217s play park and staff also have three play tents, mats for younger children and a small selection of safe toys.South Kintyre Development Trust (SKDT) which manages the attraction has putters to suit all heights and a scorecard is provided.At the end of May SKDT was awarded £75,000 from the Big Lottery Fund (BLF).A BLF press release stated: \u0026#8216This funding will enable the organisation to not only continue but develop their activities at Campbeltown village hall.\u0026#8217At the opening were South Kintyre Development Trust\u0026#8217s Shaun Brown,  putting green staff Tina Chestnut and Peter Lusher with Morag McMillan. 25_c23puttinggreen01Baby Julia Skibinska, 11 months, was happy to play by the putting green. 25_c23puttinggreen02Cate McMillan, 11 months, chewed on some plastic ice cream. 25_c23puttinggreen03\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Momentum has since picked-up.Last year 30 newcomers were trained to sail dinghies and a new stand-up paddle-boarding (SUP) group was formed local volunteers are now completing their training as SUP instructors.A first ever community regatta is planned for August 4 to open up participation in a range of marine sports.Two community organisations and three local sports clubs \u0026#8211 sailing, kayaking and diving \u0026#8211 have joined the SCIO as corporate members, with the approval of their national governing bodies.Others are likely to follow.\u0026#8216We didn’t start out to break new ground,\u0026#8217 added Mr Fox, \u0026#8216But the feedback we are getting suggests that our approach is both unusual and attractive to funders, because we have combined community- and sports groups in a single, inclusive organisation.\u0026#8216But we still have to make the case, and objective cost/benefit analysis of the options is essential. \u0026#8216The options appraisal will look at potential locations for the proposed new building, taking account of community interest as well as planning and technical issues.Jennifer Nicoll, Argyll and the Islands area manager for HIE, said: \u0026#8216Kintyre Seasports is an ambitious project involving a large scale redevelopment and therefore requires a full options appraisal of possible sites.\u0026#8216I am pleased we are able to support this early stage of the project and look forward to the findings of the appraisal.\u0026#8217Kintyre Seasports Project member and the Kintyre Canoe Club coach, Sid Gallagher, ran an well supported introduction to canoeing session last Saturday.Young canoeists trying out the sport are from left: Riley Suddes, 10, Sean West, 10, Flint-Phoenix Barrett, 10, Bradley Suddes, 12 and coach Sid Gallagher. 25_c23canoeing03Morag McLean and her grand-daughter Hollie McLean, 5, try canoeing. 25_c23canoeing02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"makeover resurrects st kierans hall","story":"The sale of Campbeltown\u0026#8217s Red Cross hall has spurred the refurbishment of St Kieran\u0026#8217s own premises next door.In common with many town charities, St Kieran\u0026#8217s had held its own church coffee mornings in the Red Cross hall which the national charity is attempting to sell.St Kieran\u0026#8217s hall, which has upstairs and downstairs rooms and a serviceable kitchen, was once the town\u0026#8217s Roman Catholic primary school but since closing had fallen into a state of disrepair.Pensioner Archie Wilson, who helped in the six week refurbishment, said: \u0026#8216I remember the classrooms  from those odd occasions when I went to school.\u0026#8217The church\u0026#8217s priest, Father Tony Wood said: \u0026#8216I am very grateful for all the work that has been done and how it has been completed.\u0026#8216The plaster was falling off the walls and the windows were black.

The minimum owners\u0026#8217 contribution for each unit was £5,000. After a lengthy period he sold all of his flats.\u0026#8216Council officers, due to their breadth of experience of historic building repair, have gone way beyond their nominal roles to help the association and stop the project falling to pieces.\u0026#8217HES approved the council’s CARS bid in January 2015.  During the next three years, the association came up with £101,000 between them.The association was awarded a CARS grant of £383,000, which included £306,000 from HES and a private sector housing grant £141,000 making a total project value of £625,000.A council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216CARS money was ring-fenced for the scheme but had to be committed by March 2018.\u0026#8217Shortly after the cash was guaranteed,  the association appointed  a firm of Glasgow conservation architects, ZM Architecture Ltd., to lead a consultation team to scope, survey and cost the scheme.The repair project has three parts: high level repairs including roofing, leadwork and rainwater goods, extensive stone repairs and the replacement of the rear walkways and failing amenity deck.A council spokesperson added: \u0026#8216Although the building is not covered by statutory listing it is considered of historical importance and occupies a key location in the town centre.\u0026#8217After 12 months of development work the works were put out to tender and five quotes were obtained.Glasgow conservation specialists John Fulton  (Plumbers) Ltd was appointed. The firm is expected to use a number of Kintyre sub-contractors.An incident in July 2015, when a teenager narrowly escaped death, illustrated the urgent need for repairs.The 12-year-old boy fell, about 20 feet into the shop below through the rotten decking skylight, while taking part in the latest craze \u0026#8211 free running \u0026#8211 popularised in films such as Casino Royale.For more on the regeneration of Campbeltown see an Argyll and Bute Council feature on pages 14 and 15.George McMillan looks into the hole in his roof in 2015. 25_c30roof01The timber rooflight structure, on the leaky deck, after the 2015 incident.  25_c30roof03Scaffolding is erected at 22 to 30 Main Street.  NO_c23cars10_scaffold_erectionLast week scaffolding was erected through the deck area.  NO_c23cars11_scaffold_through_deckThe full deck area.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.  And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Rockers Altered Sky are fulfilling their ambition of playing at Download Festival, Britain\u0026rsquos premier hard rock and heavy metal festival, on Thursday, June 7, with plans for a UK summer tour also set to be announced in the coming weeks.  The band, which includes Haddington\u0026rsquos Ana Nowosielska and Amy Blair, will be the main support in the Doghouse Tent, with the gig taking place the day before the main festival gets under way.  Ana, the band\u0026rsquos lead singer, was excited \u0026ldquobeyond words ahead of the festival, which is celebrating its 16th year.

The band are then hoping to get back on the open road, with a UK tour being organised and the band keen to venture further afield again.  Last autumn, the band enjoyed a 19-date tour which saw them performing in the Philippines and Japan.  Ana told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are obviously talking about going back to Asia again. We met so many good people and made so many wonderful relationships.  \u0026ldquoWe would like to tour Europe \u0026ndash hit up Germany and we had an Italian tour in the works a year ago which fell through.  \u0026ldquoThen, of course, we would like to get over to the USA.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Between April 1 last year and the end of March 2018, 2,006 three-day emergency food supplies were given to local people.  Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

As many as 1,600 homes \u0026ndash as well as business units, a supermarket, primary school and various green spaces \u0026ndash are planned for the former opencast mine site at Blindwells.  The first housebuilder is expected to be announced this summer, with work on housing getting under way potentially by the end of the year.  In the meantime, preparatory work has been carried out on the site, which is sandwiched between the A1 north of Tranent and the A198 south of Cockenzie and Port Seton.  Now Hargreaves, which is behind the proposals, is looking to create an access to the site off the roundabout to the north of the A1 at Bankton Junction.  Iain Slater, development and estates director, said the new exit would be permanent, although it would initially be limited to construction traffic.  Other works are planned for the junction, which links the A1 with the A198.  Mr Slater said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the permission the road layout will be altered to allow for the additional cars generated from the Blindwells development.  \u0026ldquoThese works include widening of the A198 approaching the roundabout to increase capacity [as well as] the installation of a filter lane to allow cars leaving the A1 heading east to go round to Tranent without stopping at the roundabout. There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.  Construction work on the 1,600 homes could take 12-15 years, with early plans already drawn up for a second phase further to the east which could see another 1,600 homes, as well as leisure space and a cemetery."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7870497.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Tranent singer Caitlyn Vanbeck  39 s first single takes charts by storm","story":"              TRANENT singer Caitlyn Vanbeck\u0026rsquos first single flew up the charts when it was released on Monday.

He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

The 92-year-old monarch underwent the successful procedure in May.  In recent weeks, the Queen has been seen wearing sunglasses at a number of events including the Royal Windsor Horse Show and Buckingham Palace garden parties.  The Press Association learned from a source that the Queen was treated as a day patient at the private King Edward VII\u0026rsquos hospital in London.  When approached, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \u0026ldquoI can confirm that the Queen successfully underwent a short planned procedure to treat a cataract last month.  It was business as usual for the head of state, who did not cancel or postpone any engagements.  Cataracts are when the lens, a small transparent disc inside the eye, develops cloudy patches.  Over time these patches usually become bigger causing blurry, misty vision and eventually blindness, if left untreated.  Cataracts are more common in the elderly and can affect the ability to carry out daily activities such as driving.  A family history of cataracts can increase the risk of developing them.  The Queen Mother had an operation to remove a cataract from her left eye in 1995 when she was 95 but, unlike her daughter, she spent a night in King Edward VII\u0026rsquos Hospital after the surgery.  The Queen, who is in good health, is known for her robust constitution.  In 2013, she had her first hospital stay in 10 years when, at the age of 86, she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis and missed an engagement in Swansea.  A week of engagements, including a two-day trip to Rome, was cancelled and the Queen spent one night in hospital.  She usually attends hospital for an annual routine check-up.  Cataract surgery involves replacing the cloudy lens inside the eye with an artificial one.  It is the most common operation performed in the UK, with a high success rate in improving eyesight.  The straightforward procedure usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.  During the operation, the surgeon will make a tiny cut in the eye to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with a clear plastic one.  It is often carried out as day surgery under local anaesthetic and patients usually go home on the same day.  It can take four to six weeks to recover."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc2 martini-tablet-src=/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc3 martini-desktop-src=/resources/images/7067548.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Man left two children screaming for help in searing hot car","story":"              A PRESTONPANS man left two children screaming for help in a searing hot car.

The six-year-old girl and two-year-old boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl banging on the car windows and screaming: \u0026ldquoHelp, save us.  The worried passers-by contacted the police and waited by the car to calm the kids before Yorkston eventually appeared, claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been [away] five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 27-year-old then drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  On Tuesday, Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard that Yorkston was in charge of the children when he was taking them to a nearby McDonald\u0027s and stopped off unexpectedly at the lay-by near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane told the court that the two-year-old boy and the six-year-old girl were spotted locked in the car at about 5.30pm.  Mr Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who were very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe six-year-old was shouting: \u0026lsquoHelp, save us.\u0026rsquo  The girl pointed to an opening in the trees and told the passers-by that the man looking after her was down there, the court heard.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes.

Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.

The annual list used readings taken from 2013 and named Prestonpans as the worst offender in Scotland.

And this week, the WHO confirmed that this was indeed the case.  In an email to senior environmental health officials at the local authority, representatives of WHO confirmed that they had confused the two communities due to a computer mapping error.

Offering golfers the chance to improve their\u0026nbsphandicap whilst taking in the wonderful scenery, you\u0027re\u0026nbspspoiled for choice when choosing where to play. Taking out some of the hard work, here we bring five fantastic golf courses to try out this summer.  Balmore Golf Club  Balmore Golf Club, set in the secluded rolling countryside of East Dunbartonshire\u0026nbspbetween Milngavie and Bishopbriggs, is probably the finest inland Scottish golf course you have yet to play. Central Scotland is blessed with many great courses, but they don\u0027t come any better than Balmore. A bold claim, but the club\u0026nbspare confident that once you play the perfectly manicured 18 holes designed by six-time British Open Champion Harry Vardon, you will agree\u0026nbsp- and be happy to tell others the same.    Founded in 1907, Balmore Golf Club has a proud history, but it has an even brighter future. Significant investments in facilities for the whole family such as a 6-hole Par 3 course with complimentary child membership and an extensive practice facility for keen golfers eager to perfect their game has uniquely positioned the club. It\u0027s a safe, family-friendly environment successfully attracting a new generation of members such as former Celtic and Scotland football star Kris Commons who joined during April\u0027s new member intake:  \"I\u0026rsquove played a lot of great golf courses in Scotland over the years,\" said Kris. \"But I decided to join Balmore Golf Club for two main reasons: the quality of the course itself, plus the stand-out practice facilities which are set up to cater to families. The real clincher was the massive practice area which has two full size greens with bunkers, a six-hole par 3 course, putting green and driving range. My two boys are really keen on golf, so having such an impressive practice facility that they can use to learn and enjoy the game is important. If you haven\u0026rsquot played Balmore yet, then I strongly recommend you give it a try \u0026ndash you won\u0026rsquot be disappointed.    Visit soon to judge for yourself!

The club are proud to be one of the best rated golf courses in the West of Scotland.    The course was set out by the celebrated James Braid for the Duke of Montrose in 1936 on the parkland of the Duke\u0026rsquos estate, so its holes and fairways are framed by majestic trees and magnificent views of the Trossachs. The backdrop promotes tranquillity and a sense of wellbeing even within the most trying of rounds and yet it is only 35 minutes from Glasgow city centre and only a mile from the picturesque village of Drymen. The historic ruins of Buchanan Castle overlook the course and there are many references to the Graham family within the well-appointed clubhouse.  Rob Roy McGregor walked the estate in the past so visitors and members are truly walking in the footsteps of legends.    In more recent times when the irascible Eric Brown was the professional at Buchanan Castle, the Ryder Cup sat proudly on his desk in the pro shop. In 2014 at the Gleneagles Ryder Cup the organising committees from Europe and the USA played a match at Buchanan Castle which speaks to the quality of the course.  The club is now in its second year of member control having taken over from the Montrose Estates in 2017, with plans to develop the golfing offer for members and visitors alike.  The club has successfully attracted 150 new members in the past year and is offering full membership at \u0026pound500.

It\u0027s a joy to play and most of the time very quiet, allowing the visitor to relish the ups and downs of the fairways and the tussle with undulating greens. The arresting views across to the islands of Islay, Jura and Gigha provide a delightful backdrop on an idyllic summer\u0027s day with the firm Machrihanish turf underfoot, the majesty of the dunes and wheeling seabirds providing the musical sound track.  To provide a varied test for the competent golfer, the layout is not just a predictable nine out and nine back. The classic links holes, apart from the 1st, are the 5th, another par four with its fairway like an elephant\u0027s graveyard, the 10th, a clever dogleg par five and the 15th, a \"one shotter\" with real difficulty if the elusive green is missed from the tee. Members can also enjoy complimentary use of the practise and putting areas.    The course ranks highly on a global scale. Golf Digest rated Machrihanish among the top 100 courses in the world in 2018, climbing 30 places to now rank 61st in the world. The club is also rated fourth best value for money within the UK.

A poll of deputy heads and principal teachers found nearly two thirds either \u0026ldquodisagreed or \u0026ldquostrongly disagreed when asked whether they wanted to become a headteacher - up from some 50 per cent last year.  The Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland (AHDS), which conducted the survey, said the findings highlighted a \u0026ldquosignificant leaning towards uncertainty about seeking headship roles.  The same survey went on to highlight the main concerns of headteachers as being workload, bureaucracy and lack of teaching and support staff.  On average headteachers said they were working more than 55 hours a week - twenty more hours than they are contracted for.  Read more: Schools struggle to recruit headteachers  Members of the union who submitted written responses identified a range of concerns with one stating: \u0026ldquoI have the headship qualification, but do not want the stress of headship.  Another said: \u0026ldquoI cannot see how I could become a headteacher without it being detrimental to my own family life.  One headteacher who had been in the post for a decade said they had stepped down due to family circumstances citing a lack of work life balance.  The survey comes as the Scottish Government prepares to give more powers to headteachers under a new Education Bill.  Read more: Rushing Headteachers\u0027 Charter could be \u0027disastrous\u0027  The legislation will usher in a new Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter which will enable heads to shape the curriculum, decide on how funding is allocated and select staff.  The rationale is a concern that decision-making by councils can be divorced from what is required at school level.  However, critics argue the proposals will increase school bureaucracy and make headteachers a lightening rod for any criticisms and concerns about standards making the job even more stressful.  Greg Dempster, general secretary of the AHDS, said international research proved how important high quality school leadership was.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat our survey tells us very clearly is that, due to a lack of resources or an excess of expectations, our school leaders are finding themselves diverted into front line roles or back-room bureaucracy.  \u0026ldquoThat prevents them from getting to the core of the leadership role of engaging with pupils, parents and staff in pursuit of school improvement.  \u0026ldquoThe current situation is putting many high quality candidates off headship, so the already poor recruitment position continues to worsen.  Mr Dempster said there were obvious implications for the introduction of the Headteachers\u0026rsquo Charter.  He added: \u0026ldquoSchool leaders are clearly struggling to deliver in their current roles and the government must take that reality seriously when considering how to progress and resource changes to the roles and responsibilities of school leaders.  Read more: Why Headteachers\u0027 Charter must be piloted first  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said members were increasingly highlighting concerns over the recruitment of heads.  She said: \u0026ldquoParent councils tell us they have been part of selection panels over two or more rounds of recruitment, with posts being re-advertised even in city schools where the pool of candidates should be bigger.  \u0026ldquoThe advent of the Headteacher\u0026rsquos Charter and the expectations this will place on headteachers is another factor.  \u0026ldquoWithout doubt school leaders are being expected to step up to a very demanding role which is critical in setting the right ethos and values in a school, for the good of children and their future."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/4157495.jpg?type=article-full","title":"First Minister has  no plans  to meet DUP leader during Scots Orange Order visit","story":"              First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she does not plan to meet Arlene Foster when the DUP leader attends an Orange Order parade in Fife later this month.

She is also said to be holding other meetings during her visit.  Speaking at First Minister\u0027s Questions, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I have no plans to meet Arlene Foster when she is in Scotland.\"  Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale urged the First Minister to meet with Ms Foster and raise the the issue of abortion laws in Northern Ireland while calling for a travel bursary to be set up for Northern Irish women travelling to Scotland for terminations.    She said: \"In Northern Ireland, some women have received longer jail sentences for having an abortion than the men who raped them in first place.  \"I urge the First Minister to arrange a meeting with Arlene Foster and raise this issue when she visits Scotland later this month.  \"I hope Nicola Sturgeon will consider addressing the barriers that women face when boarding ferries in Belfast in accessing services here in Scotland.  \"I support the introduction of a travel bursary for as long as Northern Irish women are denied their basic human rights.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspDUP leader Arlene Foster will tell Orange Order parade: \u0027UK will endure\u0027  Women from Northern Ireland have been able to get free abortions through the NHS in Scotland since November.

Ms Sturgeon said: \"I am absolutely in support of ensuring that all women have access to safe abortion services, and that includes women from Northern Ireland.\"  She said the Scottish Government would continue to look at how to make services in Scotland \"easier\" to access for Northern Irish women, saying the current laws there are \"deeply unfair and unjust to women\"."},{"url":null,"title":"No 10 denies claims UK back-stop plan is a  fudge ","story":"              DOWNING Street has denied the UK Cabinet\u0026rsquos agreed back-stop option to guarantee a soft border between Britain and the EU post-Brexit is a \u0026ldquofudge as Brussels was quick to question whether it would work.  After weeks of internal negotiations and even suggestions of a threatened resignation from David Davis, Theresa May finally got agreement with her Cabinet\u0026rsquos leading Brexiteers.  This followed three separate early morning meetings in her Commons office with Mr Davis and his colleagues Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, which were described as \u0026ldquoconstructive. No 10 made clear none of them had threatened to resign.  Asked if the Prime Minister was confident Brussels would accept the \u0026ldquofudged back-stop plan, her deputy spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot recognise that word but it\u0026rsquos important to say the EU put forward their proposal and we were clear\u0026hellipthat was unacceptable this is our counter-proposal. We look forward to discussing it further with the EU.  As the so-called Brexit War Cabinet later met in Downing Street, before Mrs May jetted off for the G7 summit in Canada, the Government published its technical note on its back-stop plan.  This is the time-limit, which Mr Davis had wanted inserted its omission in the draft had angered the Secretary of State, raising speculation he might quit.  A source close to the Secretary of State explained: \"The back-stop paper has been amended and now expresses, in much more detail, the time-limited nature of our proposal something the PM and David Davis have always been committed to.\"  However, political opponents seized on the key lines in the document, pointing out how it was not a guaranteed back-stop at all and it referred only to how the UK Government \u0026ldquoexpects the preferred customs option to be in place by December 2021 33 months from the start of Brexit in March 2019.  The Government believes it will never need the back-stop plan - the legal guarantee to maintain frictionless trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic \u0026ndash as it is confident of coming up with its preferred customs option post-Brexit.  The European Commission says both options are unworkable.  No 10 was unable to give any clear indication as to how the internal consideration of the two options was going or whether or not Mrs May and her colleagues were any nearer to choosing one or the other.  At Westminster, Labour\u0026rsquos Chris Leslie was dismissive, saying: \"After weeks of the Government negotiating with itself, the fudged document they have produced doesn\u0027t engage with any of the key Brexit dilemmas and is highly unlikely to lead to anything but more gridlock in the ongoing talks with the EU.\"  His party colleague Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, said Mrs May had \"signed up to a flawed proposal, which is inconsistent with her earlier commitments\".  He added: \u0026ldquoThe PM should urgently rethink her decision and back Labour\u0026rsquos call for a new comprehensive customs union and new deal with the single market after Brexit.  In Brussels, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, was downbeat.  Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, also took to social media to welcome the Government\u0026rsquos back-stop plan but said there were three questions: \u0026ldquoIs it a workable solution to avoid a hard border? Does it respect the integrity of the SM/CU? Is it an all-weather backstop?  Nigel Dodds of the DUP stressed how the back-stop plan \u0026ldquoapplies to the entire United Kingdom that is positive and a step forward.

But now it appears that House of Fraser\u0026rsquos best days are behind it following an announcement that it is to close more than half of its stores, including its Edinburgh shop on Princes Street and its Oxford Street store in London, with the loss of 6,000 jobs UK-wide.  The chain said the planned closures are vital to secure the future of the brand, which began life in Glasgow in 1849.  And while House of Fraser has endured turbulent times in the past, experts say the threat of administration is still looming if the rescue plan does not succeed.  The chain is one of a number of former giants of the high street which have struggled to cope with changing consumer habits, the rise of the internet and the high cost of running \u0026ldquobricks and mortar stores.  The decision to shut stores comes as part of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) \u0026ndash a controversial insolvency procedure in vogue among struggling retailers. If the CVA is approved by landlords, it will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions.  The group said it also has plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and \u0026ldquosecure House of Fraser\u0026rsquos future, although its flagship Buchanan Street shop will stay open.  Frank Slevin, chairman of House of Fraser, said: \u0026ldquoOur legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base, which without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business.  \u0026ldquoSo whilst closing stores is a very difficult decision, especially given the length of relationship House of Fraser has with all its locations, there should be no doubt that it is absolutely necessary if we are to continue to trade and be competitive.  House of Fraser is one of the oldest chains in the UK, with a history stretching back almost 200 years to a single shop in Glasgow.  It began life when James Arthur and Hugh Fraser opened a drapery and haberdashery business on the corner of Buchanan Street which would eventually move into the lavish building which occupies the site today.  But it was under Hugh Fraser\u0026rsquos grandson, Hugh Fraser III, that the chain really took off. Inheriting the business at the age of 21, Hugh, later Lord Fraser of Allander, began expanding by buying regional store groups Arnott \u0026amp Co and Robert Simpson \u0026amp Sons.  On his death in 1966, his son, also called Hugh, continued growing the business beyond its humble roots, buying out more than 50 companies.  However, his time in charge came to an end in the 1970s when he was engulfed by an insider trading scandal, said to have been fuelled by his gambling addiction.  House of Fraser then passed through several hands, and now Hamleys owner, the Chinese firm C.banner, is being lined up to buy a 51 per cent stake in House of Fraser and invest \u0026pound70 million into what remains of the business.  But its cash injection is pledged only on the condition the retailer can agree the CVA restructuring.  Will Wright, a restructuring partner at KPMG, which is handling the CVA, warned of dire consequences if that does not go ahead.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business has been impacted by the mounting pressures facing the UK high street, with the declining profitability of certain stores exacerbated by costly legacy leases which were originally negotiated many years ago. With trading conditions unlikely to materially improve in the short term, the future of House of Fraser is at significant risk unless steps to restructure the business both financially and operationally are taken.  Leigh Sparks, Deputy Principal and Professor of Retail Studies at the Institute for Retail Studies, University of Stirling, said that House of Fraser was one of a number of chains struggling to stay relevant in the modern age.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere are other department stores which have gone by the wayside and it is a format which is not as popular with customers as it used to be.  \u0026ldquoMany of the products department stores sell can now be found in other shops on the high street for online for cheaper, and they are just not the draw they used to be.  \u0026ldquoThere are flagship department stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges, where the footfall is still enough to sustain them but House of Fraser is not in that bracket.  David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, added: \u0026ldquoThis is further evidence of how the retail industry is going through a period of profound transformation driven by changes in shopping habits, weak growth in wages, and rising public policy induced costs. This is upending many retail business models, and that can be painful for the firms involved and for their staff.  \u0026ldquoThe industry is in the midst of a hugely challenging period and retailers are adapting and trying to reinvent themselves. What is clear is that the retail industry will look very different in the future. This will have implications for public policy, particularly for employment prospects in communities more reliant on retail jobs, for our town centres and for future revenues from taxes on property."},{"url":null,"title":"Happy birthday for Mackintosh with first glimpse of tea rooms restoration","story":"              FROM the moment you walk through the door, the touch of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest architect, designer and artist is everywhere.  Every high-backed chair is precisely lacquered, each window handle and umbrella stand a work of art in itself. On the tables, cucumber sandwiches, crisp white napkins and Willow-patterned cups and saucers hark back to a more elegant age. Welcome to afternoon tea Charles Rennie Mackintosh style.  Yesterday was the Glasgow-born artist\u0026rsquos 150th birthday and it marked a double celebration as guests including the city\u0026rsquos Lord Provost Eva Bolander were given a sneak preview of the stunning restoration and recreation of one of his greatest works.  Four years after an ambitious plan was created to bring the original Willow Tea Rooms Building in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, back to its former glory, the scale and success of the project was revealed. Hundreds of craftspeople from as far afield as Chicago, Hong Kong, Cumbria and Kirkcaldy have worked to meticulously restore and recreate Mackintosh\u0026rsquos original vision. And it is magnificent.  Mackintosh at the Willow as it will be known (the Willow Tea Rooms name is owned by Anne Mulhern, who runs another cafe just yards away) won\u0026rsquot open to the public till 02 July. But it is worth the wait.  As well as a 200-seat tearoom and restaurant, a place to discover and rediscover the work of Mackintosh, there will be a visitor\u0026rsquos centre as well as exhibition, retail, conference and education space, creating a cultural and community hub. Elements of the site will open throughout the summer.  The Willow Tea Room Trust, which conceived and co-ordinated the \u0026pound10m renovation, hopes to welcome at least 360,000 visitors a year, providing a boost to tourism in a part of the city centre that has declined in recent years, not least after the recent fire on Sauchiehall Street.  Conceived as a a social enterprise, it already provides training and work for 40 staff, many of them young people involved in the Princes Trust charity. The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will also have a base at the site.  The original Willow Tea Rooms, opened in October 1903, was one of a series commissioned by Glasgow entrepreneur Miss Catherine Cranston, and the only one created by Mackintosh \u0026ndash her partner in design - in its entirety, from the architecture of the building to the furniture and cutlery. It also featured stunning panels by Mackintosh\u0026rsquos wife, the designer Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh and is recognised as one of the finest complete Art Nouveau schemes in the world.  The expert team behind the renovation project worked mainly from black and white photographs contained in an art periodical to get every aspect of the interior detail right. And the woman behind the transformation is delighted with the result.  \u0026ldquoThis is such a happy day, said Celia Sinclair, chair of the Trust. \u0026ldquoThis is a landmark heritage restoration and re-creation that is all about engaging the next generation of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. It\u0026rsquos also about instilling civic pride in Glasgow folk.  \u0026ldquoI hope Mackintosh and Miss Cranston would be pleased by what we have done, and I rather suspect they would love what we are trying to achieve.  \u0026ldquoMackintosh was neglected by his fellow Scots during his own time and I was amazed by the lack of interest when I originally approached various organisations over this project. But four years on this is an exciting new beginning. Toshie, your day has come.  Pamela Robertson, Professor Emerita of Mackintosh Studies at the University of Glasgow, a member of the expert panel who oversaw the renovation, described the day as a \u0026ldquomilestone in the history of the building.  She added: \u0026ldquoThis was a journey of discovery for all of us.

The YouGov survey for The Times Scotland found the Scottish Conservatives have retaken second place on 27% - up 4% from the last poll - while Labour have dropped 5% to 23% in Westminster voting intentions.  Despite the SNP and Tories both growing in support by 4% since January, a seat projection from the poll gave the SNP 43 MPs - up from the current 35 - but saw the Tories drop two seats to 11.  Labour would lose six seats and be left with just one MP, according to the poll of more than 1,000 Scots carried out at the start of June.  However, a similar seat projection on the proportional system Scottish Parliament would see the SNP lose nine seats despite an increase in voting intentions for the party.  The projection would see the Greens pick up three seats and Labour, Lib Dems and Tories pick up two each.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: \"This is an extraordinary endorsement of our record in government, with people continuing to put their trust in the SNP to deliver for Scotland.  \"But it also shows that we\u0027re winning the argument over Scotland\u0027s future - how best we keep driving our country forward, delivering the best public services anywhere in the UK and building a fairer country.  \"Our vision to create a successful economy and flourishing, inclusive society could not be further at odds with despair and chaos of Brexit from the Tories.  \"But these figures will make dismal reading for Labour. They\u0027ve got no credibility on the serious issues we face as a country, Richard Leonard is a struggling leader and that\u0027s why they\u0027re plummeting in the polls.\"  The poll found Mr Leonard\u0027s approval rating was -20 while UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn has an overall -30 rating among Scottish voters surveyed.  Ruth Davidson was the only senior politician with a postive rating at 11. Theresa May scored lowest at -44 with Nicola Sturgeon on -2.  The poll recorded no change in support for independence from the 45% in the 2014 referendum.  Support for a referendum in the next five years stood at 40%, with 52% against and 8% unsure."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7896810.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Storm in a teacake  Mystery   235 000 Rolls-Royce Tory donor revealed as Tunnock s tycoon","story":"              SNP-run Glasgow City Council accepted a \u0026pound235,000 Rolls Royce Ghost from a Tory donor who supported the No campaign in 2014, it has emerged.  Boyd Tunnock, whose family firm makes some of Scotland\u0026rsquos most famous biscuits, gifted the car to the city for the use of Lord Provost Eva Bolander.  When the council announced receipt of the car earlier this week it caused an outcry, after the authrority refused to name the donor, saying he wished to remain anonymous.    The Labour party also said it was \u0026ldquoDickensian for the civic head of a council making public service cuts to be chauffeured around the city in a luxury car.  The identity of Mr Tunnock is also awkward for the SNP administration.  In 2014, he was a prominent opponent of independence, posing with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at his Uddingston plant with dozens of teacakes spelling out the word No.  \u0026ldquoPersonally, I think the best choice in every respect is to say No, he was quoted saying in a Scottish Conservative press release.  Electoral Commission records also show he gave \u0026pound10,000 to the UK Conservatives in 2016 and a further \u0026pound20,000 in 2017.  Despite Labour criticism of the gift, it is understood the car donation was facilitated by a Labour councillor, John Kane.  A source confirmed Mr Tunnock, 85, was the donor.  A noted car fanatic, the businessman has a history of philanthropy involved past vehicles."},{"url":null,"title":"Israelis and Palestinians gear up for fresh confrontation","story":"              Israelis and Palestinians are gearing up for another mass demonstration along the fence with Gaza.  Palestinian protesters have burnt tyres near the border as Israeli soldiers took position.  Israeli firefighters are on stand-by to battle fires caused by kites rigged with burning rags launched by Palestinians which have damaged forests and crops in past protests.  More than 115 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire during near-weekly demonstrations that began on March 30.  Protests led by the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza are fuelled by frustration over a decade-old Israel-Egyptian blockade, imposed after Hamas seized control there.  Israel is bracing for a large turnout as the protest coincides with \u0026ldquoJerusalem Day, which its arch-enemy Iran established to coincide with the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan to express support for the Palestinians.  Meanwhile, in the Syrian capital Damascus, scores of Syrians and Palestinians commemorated Jerusalem Day by marching through the streets and chanting anti-Israel slogans.  The men and women marched from the Hamidyeh market in the old city of Damascus to the Umayyad Mosque and waved the Syrian and Palestinian flags.  Hamid Hassan, 73, a Palestinian, said that the Jerusalem Day \u0026ldquomeans a lot for us. Jerusalem is an Arab land and it\u0026rsquos the land of all religions.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to offer martyrs until we liberate it. We will never kneel.  Syrian citizen Samah Abdullah, 42, said the issue of Jerusalem is the cause of all Muslims, adding that commemorating the day is a \u0026ldquomotivation for us and for all Palestinians to restore the occupied land."},{"url":null,"title":"In pictures  Hawick Common Riding","story":"              The tradition of common riding dates back to the 13th and 14th centuries, during the continual land border wars both with England and against other clans. It was a\u0026nbspBorder Country\u0026nbspcustom to plunder and thieve cattle, known as reiving (a historical name for\u0026nbsprobbing), and commonplace amongst the major Borders families. In these lawless and battle-strewn times, it became the practice of the day for the local lord to appoint a leading townsperson, who would then ride the clan\u0027s boundaries, or \"marches\", to protect their\u0026nbspcommon lands\u0026nbspand prevent encroachment by neighbouring landlords and their peoples.  Long after they ceased to be essential, the ridings continued in commemoration of local legend, history and tradition.  Hawick Common Riding is the first of the annual Border events, it celebrates the capture of an English flag from a raiding party in 1514 by the youth of Hawick at Hornshole and the ancient custom of riding the marches or boundaries of the common land.  \u0026nbsp"}]
