Photograph: Evan TreacyInphoThe Government will need to have a “clearer understanding” of the costs and benefits of jointly hosting the 2028 European Championships before it can commit to supporting the bid, Minister of State for Sport Jack Chambers has said.Mr Chambers said the Department of Sport is engaging closely with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in order to “better evaluate” the case for bidding for hosting the tournament and “no commitments have been made at this point”.The FAI formally announced a joint bid with England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales to host the 2028 European Championships earlier this month.The initial aim of the UK and Ireland to host the 2030 World Cup was abandoned with the five FAs deciding to “focus solely” on the Euros following a feasibility study “to host the third largest sports event in the world”.CostsMr Chambers was responding to Labour TD Aodhán Ó Ríordáin in the Dáil on Thursday, who said with “so many deficits” within soccer in Ireland, the hosting of the tournament had to be questioned.Mr Ó Ríordáin said there were major infrastructural deficits in Irish football, with controversy over the redevelopment of Dalymount Park and the future of Tolka Park while around only a third of all League of Ireland footballers have a Junior Certificate qualification.“In terms of Government support for a potential bid to host the 2028 championships, while I and the department are positively disposed to such a bid, we will have to have a clearer understanding of the costs and benefits of jointly hosting the event before committing to supporting the bid,” Mr Chambers said.“The department is engaging closely with the FAI in order to better evaluate the case for bidding for Euro 28 and no commitments have been made at this point.”Mr Chambers said an examination of the cost benefit was “a prudent and appropriate thing to do” adding “we’ll examine the ratio to see whether any potential bid would stack up”.Mr Chambers said there was an “infrastructure deficit” that had to be addressed as well strengthening grassroots and League of Ireland facilities.“What I would say is, it is not a question of either or potentially hosting a major event would bring significant economic benefit to the country,” Mr Chambers said.“This could bring huge north-south east-west benefits and I would argue there is scope to explore both properly, so it has a meaningful impact on the broader economy, but also in our commitment to developing League of Ireland infrastructure.”Mr Ó Ríordáin said there was “greater energy and atmosphere” around the League of Ireland currently than there had been for a number of years."},{"url":null,"title":"eu to impose unprecedented sanctions on russia as leaders meet","story":"European Commission president has condemned Russia\u0027s invasion of Ukraine as barbaric and has promised a package of massive and targeted sanctions in response. Video: European Commission British foreign secretary Liz Truss arrives at Downing Street on Thursday morning for  an emergency meeting to discuss the UK response to the crisis in Ukraine. Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesThe European Union has vowed to unleash unprecedented sanctions against Russia as leaders head for Brussels for an emergency summit in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The prospect of cutting Russia off from the international banking system is on the table as well as blocking its supply of crucial electrical components in a bid to force Moscow to change course.A group of EU member states that border Russia have called for Nato to convene to consider a collective response, warning that Russia’s actions are a threat to them.Some EU national leaders had wavered about imposing such sanctions for fear of the price that EU economies would also pay, and concerns over the continent’s reliance on imports of Russian gas at a time when costs are already high and supplies short.But the strikes on targets in across the country including Ukraine’s capital Kyiv and advance of Russian troops over the borders is said to have hardened EU resolve and forged unity among the 27 as their ambassadors convened in Brussels to prepare a response early on Thursday.“These are among the darkest hours for Europe since the end of World War Two. A major nuclear power has attacked a neighbour country, and is threatening reprisals on any other states that may come to its rescue,” the EU’s foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell Fontelles said in a hastily-convened address.“This is not only the greatest violation of international law, it’s a violation of the basic principles of human coexistence. It’s costing many lives, with unknown consequences ahead of us.He vowed that the EU would “respond in the strongest possible terms” with “the strongest package, the harshest package of sanctions we have ever implemented”, and that Russia’s leadership would face “unprecedented isolation”.“This is not a question of diplomatic power games, it’s a matter of life and death. It’s about the future of our global community and we will stand united,” he continued.Beyond sanctions, some EU member states that are members of Nato have called talks to consider a military response.Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, which all border Russia, were once ruled by Moscow and fall within the area to which Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his country has a historical claim.All agreed to hold talks under Nato’s Article 4 on Thursday, according to a statement from the Estonian government. Article 4 provides for joint Nato consultations and potentially a response if any of its members feel “the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened”. It has been used six times since 1949.“Russia’s widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all Nat0 countries,” Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas said in a statement.‘Bloodshed and destruction’Boris Johnson has promised to respond decisively to what he described as Vladimir Putin’s choice of “a path of bloodshed and destruction” in Ukraine. Mr Johnson, who was woken up shortly after 4am with news of the Russian invasion, chaired an emergency Cobra meeting in Downing Street at 7.30am. “I am appalled by the horrific events in Ukraine and I have spoken to President Zelenskiy to discuss next steps. President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine. The UK and our allies will respond decisively,” he said. The British prime minister, who faced criticism for the weakness of sanctions he announced earlier this week, will unveil tougher measures later on Thursday. Labour leader Keir Starmer said Britain and Nato must respond decisively to Mr Putin’s actions, which he said would have “horrendous and tragic” consequences. “There can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we all depend. There will be dark days ahead. But Putin will learn the same lesson as Europe’s tyrants of the last century: that the resolve of the world is harder than he imagines and the desire for liberty burns stronger than ever. The light will prevail,” he said. “We must now match our rhetoric with action. We must urgently reinforce our Nato allies. The hardest possible sanctions must be taken against all those linked to Putin. The influence of Russian money must be extricated from the UK. And those who have for too long turned a blind eye to Russia’s actions must reckon with their own consciences.” Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said that Britain and its allies should not be squeamish about imposing sanctions on Russia that will come at an economic cost to themselves. He said the cost of living crisis in western countries would get worse if Mr Putin is allowed to go unpunished for his action in Ukraine. “The decisions made around Europe are absolutely going to shape the way Vladimir Putin sees this,” he told the BBC. “The reality is that if we leave this to stand, if we let this pass, you can forget about petrol at £1.70 a litre, which is where it’s heading now. It will be significantly higher. 10 per cent of the world’s wheat is grown in Ukraine and the idea that this year’s going to be a good crop, I’m afraid, is for the birds. This is absolutely one of those moments where we’re going to see the cost-of-living crisis driven by war.” ‘Terrible day’German chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned the Russian invasion as a “blatant breach of international law, that is in no way justifiable”.Mr Scholz has called an emergency meeting of the G7, of which Berlin is current head, before this evening’s emergency summit of EU leaders.“Our solidarity is with Ukraine and its people. Russia must stop this military action right now,” said Mr Scholz in a written statement. “It is a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.”German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said “the world community will not forget Russia’s day of shame”.On Wednesday night, Berlin city officials bathed the Brandenburg Gate in Ukraine’s national colours of blue and yellow.Polish president Andrzej Duda said that, “despite the efforts of the international community, Ukraine has fallen victim to a brutal, unprovoked and unjustified Russian attack”.“We will jointly respond to Russia’s brutal aggression and will not leave Ukraine without support,” he said, adding he had spoken to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenski just before 6am.Polish president Mateusz Morawiecki appealed to other EU leaders to approve the “fiercest possible sanctions” this evening. “Our support of Ukraine must be real,” he said.A Polish government spokesman confirmed the request under Article 4, allowing for consultations “whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened”.Latvian prime minister Krisjanis Karins also called for Article 4 consultations.“The Russian military aggression against Ukraine’s sovereignty, people and democracy is totally unacceptable,” he said. “It is Putin’s responsibility to end it immediately.”The Nato founding treaty’s Article 5 calls for collective defence measures after attack on any member of Nato, which does not include non-member Ukraine.Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda has signed a decree calling for a state of emergency in his country, according to public broadcaster LRT.As members of Nato and the EU – but also the former eastern bloc - history and geography have made the three Baltic countries – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - and Poland particularly mindful of Russia’s intentions in the region.Last week Lithuania’s foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis warned: “The battle for Ukraine is a battle for Europe. If Putin is not stopped there, he will go further.”“ France firmly condemns the Russian decision to invade Ukraine,” President Emmanuel Macron tweeted. “Russia must put an end to its military operations immediately. France stands in solidarity with Ukraine. She is beside the Ukrainians and acts with her partners and allies for the war to end.” Mr Macron will participate in a G7 videoconference on Thursday afternoon and then go to Brussels for the summit of EU leaders to decide on “massive” sanctions against Moscow. The ambassadors of all 30 Nato members are to hold an emergency meeting in Brussels this morning.

It is a bit of a joke because Covid restrictions have stopped.”The student described how during the autumn term, one particular maths module was taught by Dr Walling.But undergraduates were not told that Dr Walling, who was the director of Bristol University’s Institute of Pure Mathematics, had in fact passed away suddenly last May after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.“They didn\u0027t really tell us for a while. Some people started to clock on and word spread, then they sent an email about half way through the term,” the student explained. “It feels quite disrespectful to be using her content in this way.”The University College Union (UCU), which represents academics, warned that universities must be “incredibly careful” about how they use pre-recorded lecturers.Nick Varney, the union’s official for the South West, said: “It will have been upsetting for students to belatedly realise the person teaching them had already passed away.“This unfortunate situation shows why universities need to be incredibly careful about how recorded lectures are used.”A Bristol University spokesperson said it is “regrettable” that some students were not “initially aware” that Dr Walling had passed before her online lectures were used in the autumn term.They said: “Dr Lynne Walling was an outstanding academic and teacher who was much loved by her students. This unique course was created by her and the materials she produced were used as part of the overall teaching provision which is led by an experienced academic lecturer.She very much wanted these to continue to be used and we are pleased to be able to honour her legacy in doing so.“We are delivering as much in-person learning as we safely can, including lectures, seminars, and laboratories on campus. We have retained some of the more effective elements of blended learning that have been well received by students.”Universities must be open about quantity of online learningEarlier this month, The  revealed that universities could be made to declare how much of their teaching will be online when they make offers to students, under plans being considered by the Government.Vice-chancellors have been warned that they must be open with prospective students about how much face-to-face learning their course will entail.The Department for Education has started drawing up plans which could see universities obliged to state on Ucas, the university admissions service, how extensive their in-person offering will be.This would mean that when students use the service to choose which course to accept, they will be clearly informed about the mode of teaching they can expect.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"divine intervention miracle broken grimsby minster clock starts","story":"When the churchwarden for Grimsby Minster looked up and saw its centuries-old clock tick for the first time in five years, he thought it might be ine intervention.The miracle, it turns out, was not God’s work, but that of a local cheesemaker armed with a can of WD-40, a grease gun and a schoolboy with a knack for engineering.The clock on the Grimsby landmark had only been correct twice a day for the past few years, having become stuck at the time of 11.55.Local councillors had called for it to be repaired, especially since the park outside the church, St James Square, had received £1.8 million worth of funding to revamp its tired facade.However, the cost of fixing its broken mechanism was estimated at £50,000, according to the church’s former director of music.Hopes of a fix for the broken clock were all but lost until, on Saturday, the minster’s churchwarden looked up to see the hands moving for the first time in years.Christopher Daniel had not been told of any repair work and put the occurrence down to a miracle.“I do not know why or how the clock has started working again, he told Grimsby Live. It is either ine intervention, or there is a much more mundane reason that none of us are aware of.“We just cannot explain it. Not only is the mechanism working again, but the clock tells the correct time on all the faces.Little did Mr Daniel know that three days earlier, a pair of local bellringers had decided to have a go at fixing it themselves.Ricky Harwood, 47, a local cheesemaker, had been carrying out maintenance of the church’s 10 bells last Wednesday with the help of 15-year-old Jay Foley, as part of their role as members of the Grimsby Ringers.When they peered inside the wooden boxes containing the components for the clock, they discovered three dead pigeons “wrapped up” in the cogs.After removing the carcasses, the pair set about recalibrating the chimes and the hands. They then lubricated the mechanism that powers the clock, using a grease gun they had to hand and a small can of WD-40 that Mr Harwood bought from the local shop.While Mr Harwood undid the wingnuts, which releases the hands from the mechanism to allow them to be worked independently, Jay - who plans to study engineering - would run up and down the 100 steps of the church tower calling out over the phone the time shown outside on the clock\u0027s four faces.After three hours of work, the pair then left the minster without telling a soul of their good deed.Mr Harwood, who was first taught how to repair a church clock as an 11-year-old bellringer, told The : “I like fixing things and I’m a curious person and Jay likes taking things apart.“We thought we would have just a little look, it seemed a shame not to while we were there rooting around in the muck.“We gave it some WD-40, a bit more tender loving care and a bit of coaxing.The father of three, who started a new career as a cheesemaker for the Lincolnshire Poacher Cheese company last month, added: “Whether you are religious or not, I think people listen to the bells, the clock, it\u0027s a sign that the church is still there, isn’t it?“A sign that someone is still there, someone still cares. It maybe does show the substance of the society around us is starting to dwindle a bit, I think it gives people hope.”Jay, who plans to study engineering at the Humber Maritime College, said: “There is a message, I would say just go for where you want to go and if you see something that interests you, don’t stop, just continue with it.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"horror zoombombing pushing jewish life underground","story":"We were 10 minutes into my synagogue’s Zoom quiz when it was interrupted with a horrific display of child sexual abuse, with images I will never be able to unsee.It was May 2020 and that very same evening a friend told me her mother had been distraught when an online shiva, the Jewish mourning period after burial, for her relative had been disrupted with images of swastikas and people shouting “Heil Hitler”.I soon discovered that what we had experienced was Zoombombing, when internet vandals hijack video calls with offensive material. And this week I learnt these online attacks helped fuel a record high of anti-Semitic incidents in the UK last year.The Community Security Trust (CST), a charity that monitors anti-Semitism, recorded 2,255 anti-Jewish hate incidents in 2021, the highest number it has ever recorded, and a 34 per cent increase from 2020. Of these, 173 were violent assaults and 16 were Zoombombings, contributing to 552 online anti-Semitic incidents overall in 2021.“Before the pandemic, we’d never heard of Zoombombing but in the first week of lockdown, two incidents were reported to us,” says CST policy director Dave Rich. “In normal times, you can’t wander into a synagogue or a Jewish community event because there’s security on the door. Moving communal life online meant people had access to Jews in a way they hadn’t previously.”As a result, my tiny community of 280,000 or so has had to learn to treat online events as if they were physical ones. When Rich says “security on the door” he refers to the guards we have employed to protect our schools, our community centres and synagogues for as long as anyone can remember. We are more than used to looking out for ourselves.After my synagogue quiz was Zoombombed, my rabbi reported the incident to the CST, the police and Zoom, and cyber security was tightened. And it was far from relaxed before. Now the time and dates of our meetings, our ID and links are only shared on the community’s weekly email and a private Facebook group, which is tightly monitored.Cyber-security expert James Bore says: “Whatever precautions we take, Facebook remains a pressing problem. It takes just one post from someone who has not bothered to set their privacy settings properly for information about a private or communal event to get out.”Or, as Rich puts it: “It’s the online equivalent of leaving the door open.”But even if you are careful about your privacy settings, or limit certain posts to certain people, some of your so-called friends might have fake profiles, says Bore. “When people want to target particular groups, they will often create a fake profile, post some reasonable stuff and then sit back and quietly gather information.”And once they have the information they want, it is a short step to Zoombombing. “It takes very little technical knowledge I could teach someone how to do it in five minutes. You just need some virtual camera software, a nasty video and the link to the event you want to disrupt,” says Bore.So easy, in fact, that while Jews have been a particular target for Zoombombers, anyone can fall victim to the malice. In America the problem became so widespread, the FBI issued a warning about it in March 2020. The pernicious phenomenon was particularly acute in virtual classrooms and lecture halls where the n-word appeared on screens and racist slurs were made against black students. In these shores, child abuse videos have interrupted corporate meetings, gym sessions, online cheese-and-wine tasting events and support group videos for people giving up alcohol, after meeting details were shared on social media.Because not all Zoombombing stems from racist and extremist views. “I hate to say it, but some people disrupt online events because they think it’s funny,” says Bore.But when Jews and other minority groups are targeted, it is with the specific intention of causing them harm, he says. “These people are trying to hurt and upset it’s not that different from stopping someone in the street and screaming in their face. It’s emotional violence.”Although the attackers generally use the language and tactics of the far Right, they aren’t usually known extremists or members of established far-Right groups, says Rich. “They shout ‘Heil Hitler’ because they know that’s what you shout at Jews. In the main, these people are anti-social trolls rather than formal groups people who are already caught up in online troll culture”They are also mostly single men under the age of 30 who have problems operating socially, says Bore. “And they tend to think everyone hates them. It makes them particularly susceptible to Facebook’s algorithms, which are built to encourage people to lean towards ever-increasing emotional and extreme content because that’s what creates discussion and engagement on the platform.”Plus, you get outpourings of admiration on Facebook, or “love-bombing” as it has been dubbed, which for social misfits can be very powerful. “You’re someone who gets criticised for your out-there opinions. You go on Facebook and your network tells you what you said what was right. They say you’re being criticised because you are telling the truth, and they feed you more information about Jews or other minority groups. It’s one way people become extremists.”Meanwhile, for those of us who have experienced anti-Semitic Zoombombing, it feels like a new and powerful way to spread the hate in a year that was already very difficult for Jews in Britain. The record-high tally of anti-Semitic incidents last year included Islamic State-style convoys sweeping across north London blasting “F*** the Jews, rape their daughters” on loudspeakers, and the highest volume of university-related hate ever recorded, half of it erupting during and after the Israel-Gaza conflict in MayAfter the first few incidents of Zoombombing were reported to the CST, the charity acted quickly, producing online security guidance information that it disseminated across the Jewish community and also shared with other ethnic and minority ethnic groups. “It happens less than it did at the beginning of the pandemic, but there are still cases and as long as parts of Jewish communal life remains online, I’m sure they will continue,” says Rich. “Once anti-Semites discover a new tactic, they keep trying it.”In fact, Manchester Reform Synagogue – where Ridley Road, the television drama about Jewish opposition to British fascism in the 1960s, was filmed – was Zoombombed as recently as October. “Halfway through our Friday night service, during a song about liberation, the intruders started shouting and put a swastika and other dreadful racist images on the screen,” says Rabbi Robyn Ashworth-Steen. “We kicked them out immediately, but they kept trying to get back in. We were very shaken by the incident – and we are used to seeing far-Right gatherings near the synagogue and receiving anti-Semitic phone calls. But this made us feel particularly violated.”Which is of course exactly what the Zoombombers want. “It is a very effective way of causing disruption and upset,” says Bore. “We can’t say exactly how many people are involved in Zoombombing, but we can say that unless there is legislation to make social companies act more responsibly, be more accountable, it is not going to go away.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could beginning end vladimir putin","story":"More from NewsPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"last university tanker turned","story":"Progressive people are, rightly, keen to challenge the way that decision-makers unconsciously promote their own kind. But they have been blind to the way those decision-makers have spent 30 years promoting just one kind of post-school education, namely the classical model of full-time, academic-generalist three-year university degrees aimed at 18-year-olds.Mass higher education was supposed to mean higher productivity and a more tolerant, socially mobile society. Teachers favoured it and parents saw it as the route to success for their children. It was administratively simple, with universities providing courses students wanted, underpinned by a generous state loan system. But now we have reached Tony Blair’s goal of half of school leavers at university, the unintended consequences of this model have become unbearable. The Government is today announcing sanctions for poor quality university courses, a rejigging of student finance so more will repay their loans, and a renewed focus on non-academic technical and digital courses.The great rebalancing of post-school education and training is under way. And not a moment too soon. We need our great research universities to flourish and must continue to attract foreign students. But from under-providing higher education in the 1980s we are now oversupplying it and the consequences are economic, social and political.The labour market is flooded with academic-generalists when their professional-managerial jobs have, with some exceptions, stopped growing. One third of graduates are not in graduate jobs 10 years after graduating while we have a chronic shortage of “missing middle” technical skills, and a recruitment crisis in care.Employers have noticed that the signalling system that meant someone with a degree had a high level of general academic ability no longer applies. There is a switch to hiring school leavers supported by the Government’s lifetime skills guarantee and other measures. Parents, too, no longer assume that a degree is a ticket to security according to recent polls, (though many young people still like the idea of three years away from home subsidised by taxpayers).Socially, some people from disadvantaged backgrounds have risen up via university into the elite, but that happened before mass higher education, too. As recently as the late 1980s, when only 20 per cent of school leavers went to university, most professionals didn’t have degrees and completed on-the-job training combined with part-time study.Social mobility academics say mass higher education has, if anything, slowed mobility because universities are monopolised by the middle and upper-middle classes. And because of our mainly residential system, many of the brightest kids from declining areas leave home and never return. This graduatenon-graduate schism contributed to Brexit.What has been called “elite over-production” produces two sets of losers: those who didn’t go to university in the first place who see all the prizes reserved for graduates, and the bottom part of the graduate class who aren’t getting the high-status jobs they expected. Educated people tend to be more extreme and more ideological in their thinking: mass higher education plus social media equals a more intolerant political culture.Turning the tanker will take time. Record numbers are still heading to university and government sanctions will be easy to avoid. But many of the newer universities are likely to revert to something like their old polytechnic status, offering vocational and technical courses (as they already do) on a more flexible basis, to a broader age cohort of students. I would also like to see a sharp reduction in the 40 per cent of jobs that are advertised as graduate-only, which artificially sustains many courses. There are plenty of capable people who didn’t do well at exams and who, in recent years, have found themselves squeezed out of professional careers in which they could have flourished.Going to university was always partly a copy-cat status game. Rising pay levels for skilled trades and technical occupations is now shifting ideas of status, as is the rise of what James Kirkup has called the posh apprenticeship. When, for all but the most academically inclined, not going to university is cooler than going, rebalancing will be unstoppable.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putting fruit vegetables fridge serves 10 weeks extra life","story":"Fruit and vegetables can be eaten up to 10 weeks after their best before dates if they are kept in the fridge, research has found.An analysis by the food waste charity WRAP found that a few simple changes could save 14 million shopping baskets worth of food from going to waste.It said that fresh produce should be stored below 5 degrees Celsius to help it last longer. Fruit and vegetables should also be sold loose so that consumers only buy the amount of produce they need, and best before labels should be removed unless necessary.This saving comes from both enabling people to buy the right amount for their needs and to use their judgement to decide when items are still good to eat, the report said. While most supermarkets already sell some items loose, the new research presents compelling evidence for significantly increasing the practice across a wide range of fresh fruit and vegetables.The report added that household fridges are typically too warm and that vegetables, such as cucumbers and broccoli, could last longer if fridge temperatures were lowered from 9 degrees to 4 degrees. Researchers found that broccoli lasted an additional 2 weeks past its best before date when stored at 4 degrees, while the shelf life of cucumbers was extended by an extra five days.Yet households have the most to gain by taking their apples out of the fruit bowl and putting them in the fridge. WRAP found that they lasted an extra 10 weeks past their best before date. While potatoes can last an extra 3 month in the fridge, the Food Standards Agency advises against this because it can lead to higher levels of acrylamide, a carcinogenic, when the food is cooked.The charity said that supermarkets should label shelves to help their customers to understand the benefits of putting fruit and vegetables in the fridge at the correct temperature. It also called for more marketing material on the subject.It added: Do not apply a date label to uncut fresh produce – unless it can be shown that a best before date reduces overall food waste.\u0027This research could be a game-changer in the fight against food waste\u0027WRAP said that potatoes, bananas, onions and fresh pineapple should be kept at ambient temperatures.Marcus Gover, the chief executive of WRAP, said: This important research could be a game-changer in the fight against food waste and plastic pollution. We have demystified the relationship between wasted food, plastic packaging, date labels and food storage.While packaging is important and often carries out a critical role to protect food, we have proven that plastic packaging doesn’t necessarily prolong the life of uncut fresh produce.He added: We are all living with the reality of the climate emergency and the rising cost of living. This new clarity could not be more timely. We need retailers to step up and follow our recommendations so we can achieve real progress in tackling food waste and plastic pollution.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine conflict latest: Chernobyl under attack from Kremlin forces, says KyivPolitics latest news: Russia invasion of Ukraine may have to be stopped \u0026#39militarily\u0026#39, suggests Boris JohnsonMapped: Russia\u0026#39s invasion of UkraineFive ways Britain could really hurt Vladimir PutinHow Russia\u0026#39s vast military compares with Ukraine\u0026#39s compact army and Nato\u0026#39s forcesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes set announced","story":"All the Covid rule changes set to be announced by Boris Johnson TODAY as isolation axedCovid isolation rule changes and the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed are likely in Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ plan, due to be published today.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Labour leader called for an end to the failed approach to dealing with Mr Putinaposs regime - and said the British people must prepare for economic pain.In a sombre televised address, Mr Starmer warned of the horrendous and tragic consequences of war for the Ukraine and said a violent elite had stolen the future of the Russian people. He said no one would choose to live under Mr Putinaposs bandit rule unless they are forced to at the barrel of a gun.His comments came as Boris Johnson condemned Russia for unleashing a tidal wave of violence against Ukraine, with bombs and missiles raining down on innocent civilians.Mr Johnson said a massive package of sanctions had been drawn up to hobble Russia aposs economy - after his previous package was branded not good enough - and vowed to reduce dependance on Russian oil and gas.He is expected to unveil a tougher round of sanctions in a statement to MPs later today.In a televised address, the Labour leader said: We must prepare ourselves for dficulties here.We will see economic pain as we free Europe from dependence on Russian gas and clean our institutions from money stolen from the Russian people. But the British public have always been willing to make sacrice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again. He called for an end to the failed approach towards Mr Putin, which he said fed the belief that the benefits of aggression outweigh the cost. Mr Starmer said the UK needed to help Ukraine defend itself and bolster its NATO allies in eastern Europe - and bring in the toughest possible sanctions against Moscow. He said: It must be isolated, its finances frozen, its ability tocrippled. The UK has for too long been a safe haven for dirty Russian money, he added.  Mr Starmer went on: This must be a turning point in our history. We must look back and say that this terrible day was actually when Putin doomed himself to defeat. He seeks ision, so we must stay united. He hopes for inaction, so we must take a stand. He believes that we are too corrupted to do the right thing, so we must prove him wrong. I believe we can, but onlywe stand together. His comments came as Russian forces mounted a pre-dawn assault on Ukraine from the north, the south and the east, mounting attacks by air, land and sea. Western officials believe Moscow intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban areas. It is unclear whether Mr Putin will seize the whole country - as Russian forces do not appear to be ready yet - or whether he intends to create a puppet regime in Kyiv.

And £ self-isolation support payments, routine contact tracing and the legal obligation to tell your employeryou’re self-isolating will all disappear.More changes are coming down the track on March , including the removal of Day One Statutory Sick Pay, followed by the end of free lateral flow tests on April .While Boris Johnson claims he needs to tighten the purse strings on taxpayer cash, it’s prompted fury from unions and charities, who say low-wage workers and vulnerable people could be thrown to the wolves. Visitors to care homes wonapost get free tests.  But for all the noise, there’s plenty more detail in the small print of the -page ‘Living with Covid’ plan that you may have missed. Good, bad, or just interesting, here are  tricky details you may want to know ahead of the rule changes tomorrow.You’re still being asked to isolateThe legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive Covid test has been scrapped in England. So has the guidance to test for seven daysa close contact gets the virus.But you’re still beingaskedto isolateyou test positive for the virus - and you’ll be given guidance fora close contact tests positive.According to the Covid plan, “guidance will set out the precautions that those who live in the same household as someone who has Covid, or who have stayed overnight in the same household, are advised to take to reduce risk to other people. “Other contacts of people with Covid will be advised to take extra care in following general guidance for the public on safer behaviours.” Boris Johnson suggested Brits should show “restraint and responsibility”, and break the habit of going back to work and going into work when weaposre not well”. Covid advice will end - but only in nameFrom April , there will no longer be separate Covid advice on the government website - instead there’ll be general public health advice that includes Covid risks. But this advice will continue to note things we’ve learned through the pandemic, like wearing a face covering in crowded spaces, “trying to stay at home”you’re sick, “taking a testyou have Covid symptoms” despite this costing money, and “staying at home”you test positive. Of particular interest is the need for ventilation, with the Chief Scientic Advisor ordering a review on how buildings can be designed to be more infection-resistant. The report by the Royal Academy of Engineering will be published in May. There will also be “a ventilation audit of the central government estate”.Covid Day One sick pay and isolation payments will endThe £ Test and Trace Support Payment for poor workers isolating due to Covid has ended. And from March , people who fall ill with Covid will no longer be eligible for immediate aposDay Oneapos sick pay or Employment and Support Allowance. It’llto Day Four and Day Eight respectively, and people will no longer be eligible for ESAisolating due to Covid. Itaposs despite widespread calls for the Government to boost £.-a-week SSP so those struggling financially are not tempted to go back to work. Quizzed by the Mirror at a No press conference, Boris Johnson admitted: “Many people are entitled to other forms of payment. I know that won’t be everybody, and I understand that. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The failure to provide decent sick pay to all – from the first day of illness - is reckless and self-defeating. Dan Shears of the GMB union said it “guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. Restoring the three day limit is an act of national self-sabotage.Care homes are set to lose their free PPECare homes will continue to be given free personal protective equipmentthrough a new central ‘portal’ - for now - after % in a consultation said it should stay.But the plan makes clear it will end, either in March  of “until the UK IPC guidance on PPE usage for COVID- is amended or superseded,” whichever is earlier.This appears to be a tighter test than in January, when the government said free PPE would end earlythe guidance is “withdrawn or signicantly amended”. Prof Martin Green, Chief Executive of Care England, told the Mirror: “Care England is calling for the government to ensure that every bit of policy is supported by appropriate resources.”Care home visitors won’t get free testsThe plan will scrap free Covid tests for people visiting their elderly loved ones in care homes. Downing Street said the end to free testing from April  will include people visiting care homes. That is despite some free testing continuing for people with symptoms who are over , or work in health or social care . Askedthere would be free tests for visitors to care homes, Boris Johnson’s official spokesman replied: “No, this is targeted at the most vulnerable and frontline staff.” Advinia Health Care founder Dr Sanjeev Kanoria said: It is entirely unfair to ask people to pay for tests to see their loved ones, or to expect financially stressed care homes to pay. “We have residents at our homes who are visited daily by friends and family and testing is a vital tool to keeping them and our staff safe. “Getting rid of free testing is going to not only put vulnerable older people at risk, but it will also reduce the number of visits they receive, which are critical for their wellbeing.” We still don’t know who’ll get free testsTaxpayer-funded lateral flow tests will be scrapped for almost everyone on April , and people will have to pay. Boots plans to charge £ for each box of five. Boris Johnson claimed: “Vulnerable people will continue to have access to free tests.” But who, exactly, counts as vulnerable  We already know people visiting care homes won’t get them, and the government hasn’t yet confirmed exactly who they’ll go to.It’s thought the over-s, the immunosuppressed, and patients on NHS wards will be eligible for some free tests, but exact lists are still being drawn up.A No spokesman said: “There will be free symptomatic tests available for social care and healthcare staff. On the position on asymptomatic testing, it will be set out by the Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England in due course”.The medicine delivery service will endA “medicine delivery service” that was set up for people isolating due to Covid will no longer be available from midnight tonight. It was for people who were self-isolating to get prescription medication, by calling their local pharmacy or dispensing doctor. It was already a low-key service, described by the government as a “last resort” with patients told to rely on friends, family and volunteersthey possibly could. … Despite a greater risk to some peopleThe plan admits the risk of death from the virus is higheryou have conditions like Down’s syndrome, solid organ transplantation, Dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and neurological conditions. “Those living in more deprived areas and from certain ethnic minority groups were also at higher risk of COVID- mortality,” the plan adds. Yet while the most vulnerable are being offered an extra vaccine dose this Spring, the plan says: “The majority of people previously considered clinically extremely vulnerable are now advised to follow the same general guidance as everyone .” Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said on Monday: “This virus feeds off inequality and it drives inequality, and that needs to be borne in mind at all times through this.” Askedhe was satisfied the plan would keep immunosuppressed safe enough, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Mirror: “I’d like the prevalence to be lower, the rates of infections to be lower.… And the threat of a more powerful iantGovernment advisors have warned it is a “realistic possibility” that a new iant will evade vaccines or be more severe. The NERVTAG group even suggested a future iant could be as deadly as MERSwith a % fatality rate.“The loss of virulence as viruses evolve is a common misconception,” the experts said - suggesting milder Omicron was good luck.Sir Patrick Vallance said the UK would need to be able to “respond quickly” in weeks to rush controls back into being. “The resilience and the ability to ramp up is absolutely crucial,” the Chief Scientic Advisor said on Monday. “That doesn’t mean ramp up over months -something goes wrong, you need to be able to ramp up very quickly. Just remember how quickly Omicron took off - that tells us you’ve got a couple of weeks to get things back in action.” But the plan for living with Covid promises no such timescale. It simply says: “The Government will retain core infrastructure and capabilities in England to scale up testing in the case of a new dangerous iant.” … And the NHS is still under pressure No has claimed Covid is no longer putting stress on the NHS “in any way” - but Sir Chris Whitty has warned some hospitals are still under “signicant pressure”.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman said on Monday: “There is still a relatively large amount of Covid circulating in the population, but because of the therapeutics and vaccinations and the other defences we’ve built, we’ve seen that it is not in any way placing stress on our NHS - in fact ICU numbers continue to fall, ditto hospitalisations, admissions and deaths, and that is to be welcomed.” Yet hours later, Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty told Monday night’s press conference: “It is certainly the case that there are hospitals in the UK which are still under signicant pressure as a result of Omicron, and I think we should be really clear about that.” He added the “big dference” is the trajectory is “steadily down”, and the number ending up in intensive care is “a very very much smaller proportion” as a result of vaccination and Omicron being milder. Surveillance is being stripped backOfficials said the government will maintain strong domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey to spot new iants, and the Siren and Vivaldi studies. But the Mirror understands staff on the ONS infection survey are still awaiting news on their future - and there’s no guarantee it will happen at the same scale it does now. Boris Johnson boasted on Monday: “We want to have the keenest pair of eyes in the crowaposs nest to watch for the iceberg in the form of a new iant. And his Chief Scientic Advisor said: “That detection system is going to be vital”. But the living with Covid plan says only there will be “scaled-down, critical surveillance capabilities”.The hotel quarantine system is being shut down for goodThe UK’s Covid travel ‘red list’ was wiped clean in December after ministers realised it was pointless trying to keep Omicron out. But the ability to force people into £,-a-night hotel quarantine was kept in place - until now. The living with Covid plan reveals it will be permanently axed next month, and travellers will instead be told to isolate at homethere is a new iant. The plan says: “The infrastructure for hotel quarantine will be fully stood down from the end of March. “The Government is developing options to increase compliance with home isolation in its place should quarantine measures need to be reintroduced.”You won’t be able to view the NHS Covid passThe government stopped venues having to ask punters for a Covid pass in January. But pubs and clubs could still request onethey wanted - until now. The plan reveals the NHS Covid Pass will only remain available within the NHS app “for a limited period”, to support its use in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The app will, however, “continue to allow iniduals access to their vaccination status for international travel, as well as their recovery status for travel to those overseas destinations that recognise it.” Read MoreRead More"},{"url":null,"title":"mps demand end london laundromat","story":"MPs demand end to London laundromat allowing dirty Russian money in UK capitalMPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital.

Boris Johnson announced sanctions against three billionaire oligarchs and five banks in retaliation for Kremlin forces launching action in the breakaway regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.The Prime Minister told the Commons: “Any assets they hold in the UK will be frozen, the iniduals concerned will be banned from travelling here, and we will prohibit all UK iniduals and entities from having any dealings with them. “This is the first tranche, the first barrage, of what we are prepared to do.“We will hold further sanctions at readiness, to be deployed alongside the United States and the European Unionthe situation escalates still further.” Critics blasted the move after it emerged the oligarch trio have been on a US sanctions list since  - meaning it is unlikely many UK businesses have dealings with them. Mr Johnson insisted the Government would “be bringing forward further measures to hit Russian iniduals and Russian companies of strategic importance to Russia, stopping Russian companies from raising money on London markets and stopping them even trading in pounds and dollars”. Keir Starmer said: “We have failed to stop the flow of illicit Russian finance into Britain.” Calling for the invasion to be “a turning point”, the Labour leader added: “We need an end to oligarch impunity, we need to draw a line under Companies House providing easy cover for shell companies, we need to ensure that our anti-money-laundering laws are enforced.” Former Treasury Minister Dame Angela Eagle questioned whether the sanctions would “close down the so-called London laundromat which is laundering dirty Russian money straight through the City”. MPs have become increasingly frustrated at the failure to crackdown Russia on cash swirling around the capital. Mega-rich, Kremlin-linked tycoons have bought multi-million-pound mansions in London and country estates in Surrey, sending their children to elite boarding schools. Ministers have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye or even encouraging them because of the funds they pump into the UK economy.  MPs on Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee published a damning report in July  accusing successive governments of paving the way for Russian funds to infiltrate Britain. “It would appear that the UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money,” the -page study said. “The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions –any – were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth.” Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper tonight said Britain had become a “centre for illicit finance that reality discredits us in the eyes of the world”.  She demanded “much stronger action against illicit finance in the City of London, and the way in which - not just Russian money and illegal money, including money from organised crime in other countries - it’s possible to launder that money in the UK because there just aren’t strong enough checks in place”. Former Foreign Office Minister Chris Bryant, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Russia, fumed: “We have to close the dirty Russian money down.” Exeter University academic Tena Prelec, part of a research team investigating international kleptocracy, said: “Our research shows elite iniduals from post-Soviet states are laundering their wealth and reputations in the UK, knowingly and willingly supported by a network of British professionals.  “The UK remains a safe haven for dirty money, a great deal of which comes from Russia and Eurasia. “Failure to tackle this thriving billion-dollar industry is damaging for the UK’s rule of law and to the UK’s professed role as an opponent of international corruption.” Campaigner Bill Browder, the head of Global Magnitsky Justice campaign, branded the Government’s sanctions “pretty tepid”. He added: “We should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money.”  He said: “We don’t have a beef with the Russian people, we have a beef with Vladimir Putin and the oligarchs who support him and the oligarchs who look after his money. “We don’t have to punish the entire Russian population at this stage of the game - we should be going after the  oligarchs who look after Putin’s money. “Putin is one of the richest men in the world, he’s stolen an enormous amount of money over the last  years, and he doesn’t hold that money in his own name, he has other people holding it for him - his oligarch trustees. “It’s pretty straightforward,we were to sanction the  oligarch trustees who hold Putin’s money and their family members in the UK, he wouldn’t invade Ukraine.“We know exactly who they are, Boris Johnson knows who they are, the Foreign Office knows who they are, the Home Office knows who they are, I know who they are. “It’s all just a question of political will - does the Government want to actually stop a war  Or do they just want to seem to be reacting to this ” Royal United Services Institute think-tank financial and security expert Tom Keatinge said of the UK sanctions: Weaposve taken a peashooter to a gunfight. “It doesnapost make any sense to me at all, the whole point of the sanctions has been to deter Putin andat the first chance you get to use these sanctions you only tickle his feet, whataposs the point  “If we ever had the upper hand, weaposve lost it today. Meanwhile, calls mounted for Russia to be stripped of the UEFA Champions League final.St Petersburg is due to host the European club game’s showpiece event in May. But Mr Johnson told MPs it was “inconceivable” Russia could now stage major sporting fixtures. There was “no chance” of holding football tournaments in a Russia that “invades sovereign countries”, he told MPs.

That means it won’t just affect students, but millions of graduates who face paying back loans almost until they retire. Shadow Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said: The Tories are delivering another stealth tax for new graduates starting out on their working lives which will hit those on low incomes hardest.  “Instead of fixing the broken system these changes simply store up problems for the future. Ministers are kicking the can down the road while seeking to limit young people’s aspirations to study at university.” So what is actually being announced today  We take you through the main features and how they will affect your wallet. Graduates will have to pay back £ a year more University graduates starting their courses from next September will pay off % of what they earn above £,-a-year. That is down from a £, threshold now, meaning more of your earnings get caught by the student loan repayments trap.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said: “Everyone who earns above the threshold will repay more each year than under the current scheme, typically by £ year – reducing disposable incomes.”The existing threshold will be maintained for current students until April . But there are not any guarantees it will rise after that. With every year that it’s frozen, the threshold effectively gets lower because wages and costs rise with inflation and you put more of your disposable income to repaying your student loan. Just weeks ago Tory ministers scrapped a plan to raise the threshold by .% in April, leaving students £ worse off per year.  Graduates could be repaying their debts into their s In a further blow, theof time graduates have to pay off their loan will be extended to  years. That means the majority will be repaying their student debt into their s. Outstanding debt is currently written off after  years. But student loans are so high, only % of students ever repay their loan in full before the  years are up. Changes to the plans will mean % of borrowers pay off their loans, according to the Department for Education. Mr Lewis added: “The majority of lower and mid earners will keep paying for many more years, increasing their costs by £,s. “Yet the highest earners who would clear within the current  years won’t be impacted.” Pupils who fail their GCSE Maths and English could be barred from student loans A consultation will be published whether to impose minimum entry requirements of Level  GCSE passes in English and Maths - or two Es at A-Level. This means pupils who fail their Maths and English GCSEs - or get lower A-Level grades - could be barred from getting student loans. Around , people went to university last year who didn’t get these passes in their GCSEs. Another consultation will look at creating a Lelong Loan Entitlement , worth around £, or the equivalent of four years of post- education, to support students to study, train, retrain or upskill at any stage.  Sir Peter Lampl, executive chair of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust, raised concerns about plans to shut out those with lower grades. He said: The introduction of any minimum grade requirement is always going to have the biggest impact on the poorest young people, as they are more likely to have lower grades because of the disadvantages they have faced in their schooling. Demand for maintenance grant quietly ditched The reforms are based on the Augar review of student loan financing in . Some of what the review promised would have helped students. For example, it demanded theof maintenance grants for poorer students, which were axed in . But these have been ignored, despite Tory ministers happily taking some of the less appetising dishes on the Augar menu. Paul Blomfield MP, Chair of the All-Party Group for Students, said: “Future students will be paying more for less. “Philip Augar’s important proposal for the reintroduction of maintenance grants for the poorest students has been quietly dropped and there’s nothing to address rising living costs, which affect those without family support the most.”Tuition fees to remain at £, - despite demand for them to be slashed Tory ministers have announced the tuition fee cap will be frozen at £, for a further two years - up to and including  . This will, at least, mean students don’t pay more for their tuition than they currently do. But the Tories have quietly rejected the Augar reportaposs key call to slash tuition fees to £,-a-year - instead keeping the annual cap at £, until  . Cutting tuition fees was the top line from the Augar report - and the reason suggested extending the repayment window. NUS UK President Larissa Kennedy said: “These changes will cost new graduates on lower and middle incomes tens of thousands of pounds over the course of their careers. “At a time where the cost of living is soaring and grad salaries crashing, for many, these changes could be the dference between heating and eating. “The Minister is saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next  years of their lives. This is nothing more than an attack on opportunity.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyPaul Blomfield MPEducationSchoolsTuition feesPoliticsGCSEsA-levels\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more. As the late, great Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said: “It isn’t enough to simply keep pulling people out of the river.

He said today: “What we see now is a full fledged invasion of Ukraine from many, multiple directions, we see air, land and naval forces taking part…This is extremely serious.”UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson slammed Russia’s tidal wave of violence which he described as an attack on democracyapos, saying the UK will always defend Ukraineaposs rights to sovereignty. Mr Johnson said: Our mission is clear. Diplomatically, politically, economically – and eventually, militarily – this hideous and barbaric venture of Vladimir Putin must end in failure.  But there is no suggestion that NATO troops will actually put boots on the ground in Ukraine, despite the invasion. Meanwhile, the unfolding war has prompted fresh questions about the size of the British Army and ongoing cuts to troop numbers. Here are some common questions answered on troop numbers in Britain, Russia and the NATO forward groups.What is the size of the UK Army and Armed Forces As of  October , the “trained strength” of the British Army is , personnel, , in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines, and , in the Royal Air Force. That gives a total of , in the UK Armed Forces.This total will however be cut by around , to achieve a smaller Army as envisaged in ‘Defence in a Competitive Age’ command paper.The target is to cut the Army, which has already been slashed back, by nearly , to ,. The Navy and RAF would increase in size slightly, to , and , respectively. Infantry, the “close combat” troops at the “core of the Army” stationed in Estonia to protect NATO allies, are falling by a fth. Tory ministers admit their numbers will drop from , in  to , in  . Why are British troop numbers being cut Overall Army numbers are being cut as part of a long-term plan by the UK government to ‘modernise’ the military.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has claimed: “We will have a modernised fleet, it will have a modern soldier and I think it will be really quite exciting.”He added with investments in new technology, including to counter cyber-attacks, the Armed Forces can do “what it says on the side of the tin rather than boasts about having lots of people and actually equipment that is  years out of date”.But General Sir Richard Sherrf, a former deputy supreme commander of NATO Europe, told the BBC : “We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the White clfs of Dover but it starts in the forest of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania.“That means we must really man the ramparts in Eastern Europe as an alliance. We should mobilise our forces such as we’ve got. I’m afraid the cupboard is pretty bare after the cumulative defence cuts over the last decade plus.” Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey told the Commons: “By the time of the next election we will have the smallest Army in  years.” How many troops does Russia have Russiaaposs army has about , personnel and its combined armed forces total about ,, according to Reuters. Its , battle tanks outnumber Ukraineaposs by more than three to one, according to the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies . A US intelligence assessment in December suggested Russia was amassing a force of up to , troops near Ukraine. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday that , Russian combat troops are on the edge of Ukraine, spread between more than  battalion tactical groups. What will Russia do in Ukraine  Western officials believe Russia intends to seize and control a very large section of Ukraine - including the capital Kiev - and will need ground troops to do so. They fear this will lead to large numbers of civilian injuries and deaths with fighting in the built-up urban area. But they are unclear whether that will mean occupying the whole country, for which Russian forces do not yet appear to be ready. Likewise, Western officials are unclear whether Vladimir Putin intends Russia to rule Ukraine directly, or to replace the government in Kiev with a more favourable puppet regime. Western intelligence suggests Russian forces spilled over Ukraine’s border from multiple directions including from Russia to Donbas, from Belarus and from occupied Crimea. There was a cyber-attack on Ukrainian financial institutions last night, and a large number of missile strikes on Mariupol port this morning but no amphibious attack in the opening hours. Not all of the estimated , Russian troops that were amassed near the borders have yet invaded. But Russian special forces are thought to be flooding into Ukraine to soften up resistance, officials believe. How many British troops are near Ukraine The UK contributes troops to NATO battlegroups, which as of last March stationed around , personnel at bases in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland . Britain leads the battlegroup in Estonia and was due soon to have around , troops there, after it promised to double the number of UK forces in the country. As of March  the UK had  troops in Estonia - including one armoured infantry battalion with main battle tanks and armoured fighting vehicles. The UK also had  troops in Poland - a Light Cavalry Squadron from the Royal Dragoon Guards, as part of a US-led force. Latvia’s battlegroup is led by Canada while Lithuania’s is led by Germany. Will NATO defend Ukraine NATO’s ‘forward presence’ troops have been stationed in member countries Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. NATO allies are also co-ordinating financial sanctions against Russia, while the UK and other allies are sending defensive lethal weapons and military support to Ukraine. However, Ukraine is not a NATO member - despite Putin’s claims that the alliance is expanding - and therefore is unlikely to have Western troops on the ground. This is a crucial distinction, because Article  of NATO’s charter - that all  member countries must respond to an attack on one member - only applies to member states. Speaking to the BBC on January , NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg ruled out sending NATO boots on the ground in Ukraine. Again today he said there were no plans to do so.  Asked on January we could see a scenario where NATO troops fight Russian troops in Ukraine, he replied: No. We are focusing on providing support to Ukraine. He added: We have to distinguish between NATO allies and Ukraine. Ukraine is a partner. We provide support. We help them with modernising their defensive security institutions, NATO allies as the United Kingdom, United States, Canada are providing training. Thousands of Ukraine soldiers have been trained. UK Defence Committee member Tobias Ellwood has said NATO forces should have been placed in Ukraine but “we blinked” and failed to do so.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

As of today, Thursday February , all remaining legal restrictions in England have been replaced with government guidance.Isolation rules, contact tracing and support payments for people who would have previously self-isolated with Covid will all end, with free testing also set to end by April .  Announcing the end of restrictions, the Prime Minister said: Because of the efforts we have made as a country over the past two years, we can now deal with it in a very dferent way. He added that it will be our personal responsibility to protect ourselves from the virus going forward. However, while pretty much all restrictions are being lted, a few will continue to remain in place. Here’s what they are. Will Covid travel rules change   Under the changes, which happened on February , fully vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests. However, they will still be required to fill in a Passenger Locator Form, and no changes have been announced regarding this yet under the aposliving with Covidapos plan. While the Department for Transport was pressing to simply the Passenger Locator Form or get rid of it completely, this has not happened yet. Boris Johnson confirmed on Monday that passenger locator forms would be reviewed and likely be scrapped before or by Easter. For now, these forms continue to be requirement for all arrivals in the UK, irrespective of vaccination status. What are the rules for unvaccinated passengers  Unvaccinated people will still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. While the requirement to self-isolate until the day  test ends today, there has been no other change made to testing for unvaccinated passengers - and itaposs likely this will stay the same for the foreseeable future, as confirmed by the Department of Transport. What happensa new iant emerges   Officials have said the government will continue to maintain domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey, to spot any new iants of concern.While Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the government won’t implement emergency measures in response to new Covid iants unless in extreme circumstances, testing measures in the NHS may be ramped up in the futureneeded.An as-of-yet unannounced toolkit for tackling new threats is reportedly being prepared, and this will be set out in detail before Easter.

Fay Churchward, , a mum-of-two from Plymouth, says batch cooking saves her around £ a week - and it also means she has more time in the evenings.  She toldLatestDeals: “I started batch cooking when the kids left home. I found I couldn’t stop making meals for four people, so it made sense to freeze a couple of portions to use another day.It also means I have more time to do the things I enjoy. If I spend a couple of hours on a weekend doing some batch cooking, I have more time in the week for what I want to do. “I am also less likely to grab a takeaway instead.

Itaposs a rare cancer and one which Arthuraposs doctor had only come across once before.It took them a few weeks to figure out which cancer it was, Sharon told the Manchester Evening News. It started off with his kidney, and now itaposs in nearly every bone in his body. Arthur has been going through chemotherapy and radiotherapy and has been in and out of hospital ever since he was diagnosed.Heaposs been out of school too, over fears of exposing him to coronavirus and other infections, but was able to celebrate his fth birthday with all of his favourite superheroes last week which his family say he aposabsolutely lovedapos.Itaposs almost like Iaposm talking about someone  but itaposs my grandson and Iaposm just heartbroken, Sharon said. She said that now, itaposs just aposa waiting gameapos to seeany of the treatments will work, after Arthur had a relapse at the beginning of the month. Sharon is calling out for apossomeone somewhereapos to help her grandson. Thereaposs lots of research going on into childrenaposs cancers but thereaposs not for this one. We need some sort of trial for this one to give him a le. She said that Arthuraposs doctor is meeting up with other medical professionals across the country to discuss possible Arthur, who lives with his family in Bacup, in Rossendale, Lancashire, has had a tough time whenever heaposs been in hospital. Sharon said that because of the pandemic heaposs been unable to get the usual entertainment thataposs put on for sick kids. Itaposs just really, really dficult, she said. He looks fit and healthy but heaposs not. He looks a bit pale. But looking at him you wouldnapost think heaposs got this illness.To donate to the fundraiser Sharon has set up, to create aposamazing memories for Arthur and his familyapos, click here.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CancerParentingPeople\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Despite being classed as long-term sick due to her severe memory loss and depression, Christina Goss was told that she was not entitled to claim benefits. The -year-old was deemed to have limited capacity for work-related activities and made a successful application for Government help in January . But she was contacted by the DWP in September  to say she had failed to provide them with a tenancy agreement from her landlord - despite never being asked due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions. Shocked Christina said the DWP told her they were cutting off her benefits and she was to pay back £, which they said she was not entitled to, the Daily Record reports.Christina, a grandmother-of-four, was prevented from taking a fatal overdose by ex-husband Neil Cairns who managed to force his way into her East Kilbride home.The error was eventually rectied, however, benefit chiefs failed to inform South Lanarkshire Council who then began chasing the grieving mother for money last month. Christina and Neil, who lost their -year-old daughter to cancer in January, say the stress of the debt ordeal has prevented them from grieving properly. After intervention by the Daily Record, the DWP have confirmed their mistake with South Lanarkshire Council also closing their case against Christina. The former carer said: “I’ve always worked throughout my le and have tried to give back as much as I can.It’s hard enough having to accept the help from Universal Credit in the first place.I was so shocked at how I was treated. It was just absolute pure hell.  “It’s a disgusting way to treat people. Going through this has been a nightmare and I hate to think how many other people are in the same position. “I’ve always had a bad memory but now I’ve been told that I’ve got the start of dementia. I’m so grateful that I’ve got Neil and I can’t thank the Daily Record enough for helping.” Neil, , added: “Christina was the victim of incompetence by people who don’t know what they’re doing. They don’t take anyone’s feelings into consideration. “They’ve got tunnel vision. They see where they want to go and they will do whatever they have to do to get there. I found her in her flat sitting with a pile of pills waiting to take them. “Thankfully I have a set of keys to her flat and was able to get in and stop her because I promised our daughter that I’d look after her mum. “We haven’t been able to grieve properly because of all this going on in the background. Christina was at the end of her tether and she didn’t know where to turn.  “I’ve been fighting tooth and nail for her but it felt like we were just banging our heads against a brick wall.” Christina moved into a flat in August  and continued to receive Universal Credit without issue until September the following year. She was told she had failed to provide a tenancy agreement to the DWP from her landlord despite never being asked for one. A notice was issued saying she owed £, to the benefits agency and it would need to be paid back - sparking her suicide attempt. After the situation was eventually rectied, Neil and Christina assumed everything had been sorted - but were dealt another blow in December when her benefits were cancelled again. She was wrongly accused of not completing a to-do list from months earlier and was told to submit a new claim. As a result, South Lanarkshire Council were informed that she wasn’t entitled to any council tax discounts. Neil explained: “Christina called me one day in a right state and said she had been trying to buy her messages but her card got declined. “It turns out that South Lanarkshire Council had put a claim on her bank account for unpaid council tax after being wrongly told by the DWP that she wasn’t entitled to any benefit. “We were able to get this reversed at the bank. The council tried it again so we contacted them to find out what was going on. “They were told by Universal Credit that Christina wasn’t entitled to any council tax benefit relief. So it all kicked off again. “I called last Friday and I thought we were making headway after sending proof of Christina’s Universal Credit. “We asked them to call them to Universal Credit but they said no, they needed to call them. So we contacted Universal Credit but they said they wouldnapost contact the council. So we were left in limbo. “They said she would have to pay back the amount that had been discounted since September  or she’d be sent to a debt collector. “That’s when we contacted the Daily Record.” A spokesperson for the DWP apologised for the upset caused and have cancelled the debt. They said: “We are incredibly sorry for the distress caused to Ms Goss. “We have cancelled her repayment to us and are working with South Lanarkshire Council to resolve the issue with her council tax.” A spokesperson for South Lanarkshire Council added: “We fully appreciate Ms Goss’s concern about the situation she has found herself in. “The council acted in good faith on information supplied by the DWP. As soon as we were informed that there may be an error involved, we worked with the DWP to recty the situation. “We are pleased to confirm the situation has been resolved and Ms Goss’s account has been brought up to date.”The Samaritans is available  you need to talk.

Shaun Dingle, who runs Dingleaposs Waste Disposal, has been contracted to clear the two-bedroom terraced house in Blackburn, which was previously occupied by a group of squatters. Workers were unable to access both the front room and kitchen because they were full to the ceiling of rubbish, Lancs.Live reports. Shaunaposs brave workers had to contend with rats, fleas and an awful stench as they worked their way around the house.After carrying out hundreds of clearances, Shaun branded this property the worst heaposd ever seen. He told Lancs.Live: Itaposs the worst house weaposve ever done. We get called out to clear some awful properties but this absolutely tops the lot. Iaposve never seen anything like it and I canapost even begin to imagine how itaposs got like this.Have your say on this story in the comment section It is understood the house, in the central area of Blackburn, has been targeted by squatters. One nearby resident, who asked not to be named, said people living in the neighbourhood have noticed for some time that the property was in a poor condition. Shaun expects his workers, wearing safety suits, will take around two days to clear the property. In the first few hours of the clearance they found evidence of rats living inside and saw fleas on the mattresses upstairs.  A broken fridge blocks the entrance to the bathroom while filthy pots and pans were found in the second bedroom. Baseball caps appear to have been hung on the wall in an attempt to make the house more like a home but Shaun says whoever had been squatting in the property has clearly been living in squalor. Itaposs worse than anything you might have seen on Britainaposs Biggest Hoarders, Shaun, , added. I honestly donapost know how anyone can live like that. Itaposs a house of horror, it really is. Blackburn with Darwen Borough Councilaposs environmental health and cleansing departments investigate complaints of nuisance caused by the build up of waste in a garden or yard of a property. If the authority considers that the build-up of rubbish is unacceptable the owner of the property is typically given a period of time to remove it. If this is not done then a legal notice can be served.

Mark Holling, from Edinburgh, was initially frustrated that his family had lost two days of their dream holiday in Madeira and had gotten apostrappedapos in Tenere amid the travel chaos.But this wasn’t the end of the complications. Mark and his family, along with their fellow passengers, wound up being flown back to Edinburgh from Tenere due to “ weather conditions in Funchal” - following more than two days of travel. The family had been due to fly from Edinburgh to Madeira on Monday morning, but an initial delay of one day was placed on his flight, meaning it was rescheduled on Tuesday, Edinburgh Live reported. After arriving at the airport on Tuesday morning for the flight, the passengers onboard were greeted with another issue, as the plane could not land at its destination in Madeira, Portugal, due to weather-related issues.  Instead, the flight landed in Tenere on Tuesday afternoon and passengers are still awaiting instructions and an update on when they will eventually make it to their destination, a day later.Mark took to Twitter to complain about the situation to Jet, saying: Ok itaposs time to take us home.In a second tweet, Mark said: So it’s been two and a half days since we left home and two full days of our seven day holiday spent travelling. Hardly worth trying now! Perhaps we should be given the option of flying back to Edinburgh now! Mark also added a photo of the amount of people on the same flight that were awaiting news. Speaking to Edinburgh Live, he added: On Sunday evening they told us the flight was delayed by one day. That left Tuesday morning but couldnapost land in Madeira due to weather problems. After holding we were erted to Tenere, sat there for two and a half hours then into the airport where we queued to be allocated to hotels To be fair, that was the only time we had unpleasant Jet staff. We left the hotel at am to come to the airport for am flight. Started boarding and some of the groups went through, goodness knows where they are now, then postponed again and awaiting update. Still waiting, quite a few folk are thinking we should give up and be taken home. John is travelling with his we and daughter and they only booked a weekaposs holiday in Madeira, meaning two days have already been consumed by delays and travelling. John also noted that his daughter is due back at university on Tuesday, so any extension to the holiday wouldapost be a viable option. He added: Itaposs more than two days lost, we should have had Monday afternoon, all of yesterday and all of today in Madeira. Evenwe do try again weaposre unlikely to be at our hotel before it gets dark and Iaposm not optimistic that weaposll be able to leave here today. Jet have commented on the issue and given an update, saying that due to reasons that were out of their control, passengers on the flight were eventually flown back to the UK last night, on February . A spokesperson said: Due to adverse weather conditions that have been affecting Funchal and the surrounding area since Monday, flight LS from Edinburgh to Funchal was erted to Tenere Airport. Our teams have been working hard to arrange accommodation and refreshments for customers affected by this unforeseen delay, as well as trying everything possible to get everyone to their intended destination as soon as possible.

The paedophile - recalled to prison for a second time in  after being found with , sick child sex abuse images - could be referred to the parole board within weeks.Monster Venablesapos plea could be put to the Board as early as April after completing his minimum sentence. James Bulgeraposs murderer has a strong chance of success, sources say, because of his good behaviour inside. The -year-old is expected to make the brazen bid for release despite re-offending, having been found with a stash of horrying child abuse images on his laptop in .  In October , Venables was denied parole after experts found he still had an attraction to sexual violence. The forensic reports gather views of prison officers, experts, psychiatrists and Venables himself.It could be presented in April and an insider told The Sun : Venables spent three years in prison after his first recall before being freed - this time around heaposs already done four years.If heaposs complied with prison treatment programmes and continued to make progress, then he stands a strong chance of release.Andthe Parole Board rules heaposs safe to go free, then only the Justice Secretary can prevent it. Venables is entitled to a hearing every two years so is due to be referred to the Board in the coming months. It is set to cost the taxpayer even more with £. million already estimated to have been spent trying to rehabilitate Venables. He was sent down in  for hoarding over a thousand vile pictures of children. The images included category A photos, the most serious type, and he also admitted having a “paedophile manual”. He has served over four years for surfing the dark web for images of boys James’ age being abused.  Sentencing him in , Mr Justice Edis said: “The children depicted were often very young and vulnerable, there is discernible pain and distress suffered.” He called Venables “manipulative and dishonest”. During his hearing, the court heard that upon his arrest he told cops in the police car: This is my own fault. I have let people down again. I have had urges, inquisitive. It won’t be a slap on the wrist for me.”The Board face having to decideit should hold a full hearing - with evidence from witnesses - or make a judgement on documents and expert opinion. It is claimed a full, oral hearing is a racing certainty because of the high-profile of the warped killer. In June , it was reported Venables was being assessed for a permanent move abroad. It was suggested authorities believed paying for him to be shted to a country like Canada, Australia or New Zealand would be cheaper than funding more failed new starts in the UK. Venables and Robert Thompson were ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James in Merseyside in . Mum Denise Fergus says Venables has shown “no remorse”.

The fan-favourite has made itself a reputation for the number one dairy product to slather on your baked potato or to spread, generously, over your morning toast. The brand has a global appeal too, having won the best butter in the world title at the  World Championship Cheese Contest.With its popularity, itaposs no surprise that Lurpak is on the pricier side of butter - which budget supermarkets have addressed by offering similar high-quality spreads while keeping the price down.But, is there a cheaper alternative to the popular - but costly - Lurpak butter Well, thataposs what Alice Suffield from Wales Online set out to find out after she picked up a few supermarket branded butters and tested them against the mighty Lurpak. Lurpak Setting the standards for the test, Alice began with Lurpak which she says has been a consistent staple in my fridge. Of course, the Lurpak butter continued to be the butter that we all know and love when she popped it on to her toast. She said: Easy to spread, melted to perfection on the warm toast, and tasted as it has for years, satisfyingly savoury, tasting just as butter should. The price did not taste as good however, as at £. it is the most expensive of our spreads, but it is to be expected from a household brand. Alice does admit that the quality and the price do match each other, but it was worth finding outmaybe she could switch to a cheaper supermarket version.Nordpak - Aldi Up first was the brand that has become pretty popular for providing popular supermarket dupes that are still big on quality, but low on price. In terms of the packaging, Alice did notice that Aldiaposs Norpak is eerily similar to itaposs branded competitor. As for the overall taste, it was found that the supermarketaposs version didnapost taste as strong as Lurpak, but that was not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, Alice found that the spread didnapost overpower the toast, unlike Lurpak, which is something that she never noticed before. She did find that it was arguably the hardest to spread out of all the butters, but that was rectied once she left it to melt on the toast for a little while. She added: The price was much more reasonable, costing £. for a g tub. When compared to the brand, it seems a sensible swap to make, with a saving of over £..Danpak - Lidl Next up on the list was the popular budget supermarket Lidl with their own Danpak which cost just £. - the cheapest of the bunch. After giving a whirl, Alice found that Lidl missed the mark with this one, as the taste was unremarkable because it didnapost really stand out compared to the others. Alice said: Sadly for me, the taste was unremarkable, you could tell it was butter, but it didnapost have the same stand-out savoury flavour that the two previous butters did. Whilst it did spread and melt with ease, I would rather pay the extra p for Aldiaposs Nordpak.Spreadable - Morrisons Last on the list was Morrisons with their very own version of Lurpak, which was, once again, eerily similar to the original. After trying this one out, Alice did find that Morrisons Spreadable was rather dferent to their other options she had tasted at this point, due to being a bit sweeter. She said: Of the three, this one was the sweetest. The rest specied that they were slightly salted, so that explains why it tasted as sweet as it did in comparison. It still tasted like butter however, and it spread and melted like a dream. At £. for g, it is the second most expensive, but still over £ cheaper than Lurpak.The verdictFrom Aliceaposs responses, it looks like Aldiaposs Nordpak took the crown as being a worthy substitute for her usual go-to Lurpak in the weekly shop. The budget supermarketaposs version was found to be a winner on quality and price, as well as providing a rather decent saving off £.. Which is good news for families looking to keep their costs low while they get in their household essentials. The reporter said that, after the test, Nordpak would be going into her basket from now on, while Morrisons Spreadable and Lidlaposs Danpak would be left on their shelves.

The -year-old had always struggled with his weight, saying when he was a child he comfort ate and in adolescence he began to smoke and did not exercise. Knowing he had to do something, over the years David gradually stopped eating red meat, gorging on sweets and gave up alcohol and also took up swimming.But after not seeing any results his GP referred him to the Low Carb Program, the Liverpool Echo reports.Have your say on this story in the comment section After joining a  Week Bootcamp, David saw remarkable results and was clinically diagnosed as being in type  diabetes remission. When he took on the challenge, David weighed roughly  stone. Just a few months later, he weighed nearer  and a half stone. He said: I began to get into the habit in my twenties of excessive drinking, leaving the pub at night and getting a takeaway, to munch watching the TV before bedtime. As a chubby, friendly type I had lots of friends but no serious girlfriends, as my overweight appearance and attitude led to being not taken too seriously, by myself and others. I have also been on umpteen weight management programmes that have had some impact but never enough to bring me below the aposobese threshold. Make dieting easy – look up the calorie count on more than , food and drinks at nhs.uk live-well healthy-weight calorie-checker He added: For the first time, through the Low Carb Program, a paradigm change has occurred, I am no longer aposobeseapos, and I feel that, for me, permanent change is possible. I eat a great iety of food, including lots of leafy vegetables, chicken, cheese, berries and cream and fish that I do enjoy. I have learnt to cut down carbs to a low level and, remarkably, this works. In conclusion,you do recognise any of my traits and le journey within your own experience, please do look for the signposts and follow them before you become diabetic, need major surgery or have to live with huge bags of medication or daily injections. Le can be much richer and more satisfying without the carbs. After all, le can be so much richer with fewer carbs and less medication. Do also be kind to yourself. There will be blips along the way, but they are just blips. David now lives a full and active le, going ballroom dancing twice a week with his we Angela, , and competes in crown-green bowling leagues four times a week in the spring and summer.

Colleen Alway was rushed to hospital with heart failure in January , she recalls listening to her family at her bedside as they were advised to help her get her affairs in order because she didnapost have long left to live.Colleen, , said doctors gave her the shock news that % of her heart had stopped working. Iaposd been having trouble breathing and when the doctors ran some tests they told me only % of my heart was actually still ing, Colleen, from Neath Port Talbot, explained. She described how her overeating and more than -a-day smoking habit had left her barely able to walk, Wales Online reports.  She said: I remember one of them saying that he didnapost know how Iaposd managed to survive that long.He then told my sisters Iaposd be lucky to see another five years given the state I was in. However, it was a male nurse working on her ward - a lovely lad called Liam - who told her all about Slimming World. Heaposd recently lost  stone himself and recommended I give it a try, said Colleen. So, after I was discharged, I went to my local branch and hobbled up to the front doors on a pair of sticks. But thataposs as far as I could get - I had no confidence, you see.My anxiety was through the roof and I was afraidanyone saw me theyaposd just point and laugh. I must have gone back and forth to that door three times before I mustered the strength to go in.  And, once she did, Colleen admitted sheaposs never looked back. She said: Iaposve always been big and have always had a problem with food, especially takeaways and sweet things. I also smoked a lot -  cigarettes a day, plus roll-ups. So Iaposd have no energy and would even struggle to go from the front door to my garden gate.  Having had asthma since childhood didnapost help the situation either. In later le, Iaposd get a cold each winter which would turn into flu.That would then become a chest infection before eventually developing into pneumonia. Iaposd be in and out of hospital every Christmas - right up until that point where I was told thatthings didnapost change I wouldnapost be around much longer. By making little alterations to her lestyle she said sheaposs noticed a huge dference. Colleen said: Itaposs not about denying yourself all the things you like to eat. Just being sensible and using lighter cooking oil or grilling food instead of frying it can make a big impact. Iaposve also joined a walking group and regularly stroll along the prom at Aberavon beach - and, while I still have to stop for the occasional breather, I never couldaposve managed that before. Iaposm now down to  stone and feel so much healthier and happier. Itaposs scary to think how close I got to the edge though.

The -year-old jumped out of a plane that was flying at ,ft above RAF Weston-on-the-Green when her canopy reportedly failed to open. A coroner said that the servicewoman, who was a veteran jumper, had been found unresponsive on the ground in Simms Farm, Chesterton, Oxon. Despite the best efforts of paramedics from the air ambulance, Sgt Fisk, who had joined the RAF in , was declared dead at the scene on September  last year. According to MailOnline, sources have said there may have been issues with Ms Fiskaposs Automatic Activation Deviceduring a training assignment, rather than a military exercise.This is supposed to ensure a parachute opens once the jumper reaches a low altitude. During a hearing at Oxfordshire Coronersapos Court on Wednesday, it was revealed that a post-mortem examination on Sgt Fiskaposs body had concluded that she had died from multiple injuries. As her parents, Fiona and Bill, listened on, Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter ruled that the full inquest hearing would have to be delayed until the police and Health and Safety Executives investigation had concluded. Detective Inspector Mike Roddy told the inquest in Oxford: In line with normal work-related death practices, Thames Valley Police are leading a joint investigation with the Health and Safety Executive. An incident room led by a senior investigating officer continues to investigate corporate manslaughter, gross misconduct manslaughter and serious offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act . We are examining the equipment used by Sgt. Fisk at the time and samples of parachutes used by staff and students. Police confirmed that they had already met with the Crown Prosecution Serviceto examine what charges might be appropriate, although they would not confirm when their investigation would conclude. The inquest also heard that a separate investigation was being carried out by the independent Defence Safety Authority, who will look to see what went wrong and how the armed forces could learn from Sgt Fiskaposs death. The inquiry, which will be led by three senior officers from across the armed forces, was expected to report this summer, after consultation with Sgt Fiskaposs family. The coroner, who asked to be kept updated on the progress of all the investigations, confirmed that he would consider writing a Prevention of Future Death report after the completion of the inquest, which is expected to be held early next year.

At the time of her death, Sgt Fiskaposs family said in a statement: It is with great sadness that we mourn the death of our dear daughter, Rachel. She lived her le with joy and thoughtfulness for others and loved the career she had chosen. Rachel will be missed by so many. A spokesman for the RAF said: Rachel was a selfless inidual, who was eager to volunteer and reassure those around her. She naturally loved her career and not only worked with professionalism and diligence, but also fun and enthusiasm spurred by her passion for what she did Rachel was a valued member of the team she worked with and esteemed by those she trained. Not only was Rachel known for her infectious smile and bubbly personality, but she could also make a cracking cup of tea. She will be deeply missed by her RAF Colleagues, and following are some heartfelt tributes from those who had the pleasure of working with Rachel. Flight Lieutenant Nathan Ellis, commanding officer at the Joint Service Parachute Centre, said: Rachel brought le, enjoyment and fun to all - her love for the job was infectious and she created a bond with everyone she worked with. She was a natural and conscientious instructor and a role model for her students. Paying tribute, Sqn Ldr Helen Simpson added: Rachel never failed to impress with her skying ability and it was very clear she would go far - but it is her personality, her humour and her huge heart that will be sorely missed by all of us at Weston-on-the-Green.

A man and a woman from Wales have been sentenced after  dogs in their care were found by the RSPCA living in hazardous and unhygienic conditions and terried of the outside worldMany of the dogs were found underweight with severe skin diseases by RSPCA officers Image: RSPCAByNia DaltonSpecialist Writer:,  Feb |comments A man and a woman have been handed a suspended prison sentence and disqualied from keeping dogs for  years, after it was found they neglected  dogs and ran an illegal puppy farm in Wales.They both pleaded guilty to three offences under the Animal Welfare Act and appeared in Swansea Magistrates Court on Friday  February.All  dogs were found by RSPCA officers in March , living in hazardous and unhygienic conditions.Thankfully, the pups are now safe in RSPCA rescue centres, and many have even found forever families. Inspector Gemma Cooper, who led the investigation, said: I was horried by the animalsapos overall health condition and the environments in which they were being kept.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.She added: It also appeared that a small scale puppy farm was being run from this location. There were three litters and a heavily pregnant bitch, who later went on to have six puppies. The conditions the dogs were kept in were not acceptable and the owners were failing to meet their needs. One pen for example - which had eight dogs in - had no space for them to get away from each other, had no comfortable area for them to rest, and was full of urine and faeces. Pens lacked sleeping areas and, in one pen, a head lamp was placed dangerously as it hung very close to a water bowl. Temperature control was lacking in all the pens as was clean, comfortable bedding and all the pens looked and smelt dirty.  Also there were no sufficient beds and water bowls for the number of dogs to prevent competition and all the adult dogs needed veterinary treatment for ious ailments. When bringing the dogs out of the first two pens none of them knew how to walk on a lead and they were all terried of the outside world. It was clear from their reactions that they have not been properly socialised and spend the majority of their time locked up in these pens and away from le. Both defendants were handed a nine-week prison sentence on each charge to run concurrently, which was suspended for  months, ordered to pay a £ victim surcharge, and were disqualied from keeping dogs for  years. One person was handed a rehabilitation activity requirement of  days and ordered to pay a £ fine. The second person was handed a -day rehabilitation activity requirement order and was ordered to undertake  hours of unpaid work.  Thankfully, all of the dogs are now safe and have been taken to RSPCA centres for rehabilitation and rehoming.One of the rescue pups, Flo, was taken to West Hatch Animal Centre, in Somerset, where she went from strength to strength, and her personality shone through more each day.Inspector Cooper added: When I first saw her she was extremely underweight and cowered in the corner. Her ribs and spine were visible and she looked pink where she had fur loss and her skin was red and inflamed. There were two bowls on the floor of her pen which were empty. I am delighted that Flo found her forever home - her transformation is just amazing. Thanks to a lot of love and care from staff at the animal centre all of the dogs have transformed into happy and healthy dogs and it is lovely to know they are in their forever homes.If you would like to adopt any of the dogs in RSPCAaposs care, visit their Find A Pet page.

He was brought to Holbrook Animal Rescue, in Horsham, West Sussex, at around eight-months-old - and has seen countless animals come and go in his time.Unlike most kennels, Holbrook keeps its dogs in a house rather than traditional kennels, making the adjustment from shelter to a home easier on the animals. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Although the Staffie cross has twice been adopted, he was quickly ed, spending almost no time with his aposnewapos families, reports SussexLive.Since then, nobody has shown any interest in him, which lead to sanctuary owners Laura and Clf Santini calling off the active search to find him his own family. But they never gave up hope that the right owner would come along one day. Hayley Georgiou, a fundraising volunteer at the centre, said: In many ways, Freddie is the perfect pet.  He has made great progress with his behaviour. He’s house trained, obedient, and has good recall so can go off-lead on walks. He only needs around  mins walking twice a day, so isn’t among the most energetic of dogs. Freddie has been described as a total sweeties with a cheeky personality - and is said to love cuddles, tummy tickles and riding in the car. The issue with Freddie is that he gets very strongly attached to his owners, and takes it upon himself to guard them, said Hayley. As such, he needs a strong ‘pack leader’ as an owner, who isn’t afraid to set boundaries and is consistent with his training. Initially, Freddie warms better to women but with time will bond just as well with men. He will need someone patient as there will be some settling in time for him, since he has spent the majority of his le at the animal rescue.If youaposre interested in rehoming Freddie, or any other animals in Holbrook Animal Rescueaposs care, visit their website.

Her unusual hairdo captured the hearts of friends and family, who compare her look to Jimmy Neutron Image: Mercury Press  Media Ltd.ByBronte Howard:,  Feb |commentsAn adorable baby girl with Downaposs syndrome has been compared to Jimmy Neutron due to her amazing hair — which could even be seen in baby scans. Georgette Winslow was born with a full head of luscious hair that has continued to grow directly upwards and has captured the hearts of family and friends. Mum, Jenni Winslow, , said that despite the four-month-old rocking an envious amount of hair, she wasnapost surprised because Georgetteaposs locks had been picked up on baby scans. Georgette has even been compared to cartoon character Jimmy Neutron, who is known for his iconic spike. Jenni, from South Dakota, US, said: Because she has Downaposs syndrome, we were going in for regular scans, and the technician would always say aposoh my god she has loads of hair!apos It was hard to see how much hair she had when was born, but once sheaposd had a little wash you could tell there was loads. We were in the NICU for a while when she was born, and all the nurses would come in and say everyone had told them to come and see her hair. Jenni says Georgetteaposs hilarious likliness to the cartoon character was first spotted by her mum, but that friends soon agreed. I was just talking to my mum one day and she said her hair reminded her of a cartoon character, she said. It was until later I found a picture of Jimmy Neutron, and I could totally see what she meant. I posted a photo of them side-by-side, and all my friends said they had thought the exact same thing. Jenni, who has two other children, debunked the old wivesapos tale that heartburn in pregnancies means hairy babies because she never suffered from the condition. Jenniaposs other children, Viola, six, and three-year-old Sullivan were also born with hair, as was husband Barrett, . She said: Sullivan was born with old man hair, he had a bald patch at the top of his head. Violaaposs hair was similar to Georgetteaposs, but it wasnapost as thick or as long as hers. Now, Georgetteaposs has just kept growing. Jenni, a personal trainer, says everyone immediately falls in love with with Georgetteaposs hair. Jenni, from South Dakota, US, said: It wasnapost a surprise when she was born with hair. Jenni has attempted to style her hair, but without much success. She said: After her bath, I just let it dry naturally and it always sticks up like that because itaposs so fluffy. I have been tempted to put it in a ponytail but I only did that once. I was scared about pulling her skin too much so we only left it up for a minute before I let it loose again. Jenni started an Instagram page to document Georgetteaposs journey and raise awareness about Downaposs syndrome. She said: A lot of time people have found the account because of her hair, and only see she has Downaposs syndrome because of the hashtags. I like to think it challenges people on their misconceptions, and helps them see the inidual before the diagnosis.

However, it was only after he got home and heaposd already given the sweets to his three boys, -year-old William and Oliver Austin and Samuel Austin, , that he discovered his mistake. The sweets were in fact not appropriate for the youngsters as they were very X-rated, with each bag boasting a colourful assortment of erect penises, sperm cells, vaginas and pairs of bum cheeks and breasts.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.The -year-old parent was mortied by his mistake - but it did give him and we Helen Austin, , a good laugh. His eldest child pointed out his blunder after opening the sweets and the dad quickly gathered them all up to avoid a crisistheir youngest child started asking questions. Safe to say the sweets, which James claims tasted vile, ended up in the bin.The dad says the bags, purchased from Candy Shop Diana, were displayed around waist height and were among other regular sweets so thataposs why he didnapost think to inspect their shape.He revealed all about the embarrassing incident in a LinkedIn post, denouncing himself as aposa terrible dadapos for not realising his error earlier, but heaposs relieved heaposs dodged having to explain the rude treats to Samuel.  James, from Derby, Derbyshire, said: It was a big parenting fail on my part but we made light of it. I couldnapost deal with the conversation that it would have sparked with Samuel. Heaposs got another two or three years until that sort of stuff is taught at school.I just wanted to get them a little treat, like you always do when you go away. I just assumed it was the Spanish Haribo.There werenapost any labels on them and the bags were surrounded by lollipops and kiddy-type stuff, so I didnapost expect a waist-high shelf to be selling that sort of confectionery.The kids have normally got sweets stashed in ious areas in their bedrooms, so when I dished them out they scuttled upstairs. It wasnapost until later on that evening until William came down in fits of laughter and asked aposhave you seen these sweets, dad apos, and me and Helen just looked at each other confused. When he brought them down and showed me the sperm one, he was still in hysterics and I didnapost know how to reach.  He continued: It suddenly dawned on me that Samuel might be about to open his so I quickly retrieved them from his room without him seeing and threw them straight in the bin. Once the crisis was averted, we had a good laugh at it. Theyaposre all very detailed. I did try one of them, and they were vile anyway. I sort of bit it, said aposnopeapos then put them all in the bin. Samuel did ask where his sweets had gone, but I told him they were off. Helenaposs just been rolling her eyes at me, but Iaposm glad everyone enjoyed my post. The dad-of-three claims heaposs learned his lesson and will be sure to check the contents of sweets before handing them over to his kids in future. Thankfully the boys didnapost go without as heaposd also got them large lollipops and a giant Milka chocolate bar on his travels too. The teens have had a good chuckle about the sweets though, telling pals at school - and James thinks some of their parents will have seen his LinkedIn post too. The post, which has been liked and commented on more than , times, said: I am a terrible father. On my last day in Benidorm, I went on a little shopping spree. I paid a visit to Candy Shop Diana, a lovely sweet shop selling lollies and other delights for the kiddies. I bought three bags of sweets and three large lollipops . When the kids got home I gave them the goodies and also a huge Milka Oreo Chocolate Bar. Later on that evening William appeared and said, aposhave you seen these sweets apos He had spotted that they were + rated and was in fits of laughter. I genuinely had not noticed. I very quickly ran into the -year-olds room, retrieved them and threw them straight in the bin. I know that seems a waste but they also tasted bloody vile as well. The moral of the story is... Well, I donapost really know. Have a great day everyone. Many commented on the viral post, with one person saying: Oh man, I am laughing out loud. I guess the moral of the story is to always read the label  Another wrote: Donapost choose the vagina one, youaposll get short-changed with the hole in the middle. While a Psychotherapist Rozmin Mukhi joked the kids will need therapy one day, adding: I will give you a  per cent discount when your kids are ready for therapy!!

Grace Morris, , from Washington in the US, works in a coffee cabin while scantily clad and has built up a loyal customer base. She uses her TikTok channel to explain exactly what her job entails - revealing that she attracts a lot of male attention from her little coffee cart. Grace describes her job by saying: I wear lingerie and I make coffee for old men. In one video, the blonde bombshell told viewers that a lot of dads from the area visit her for their caffeine fix and tend to flirt heavily with her.

When she replied she was , she claims the man told her his son was also . After chatting with the man about his son, Grace claimed she knew exactly who the -year-old was and even had classes with him. Astonishingly, she added the customer still asked for her number - a request she declined. But incidents like this are water off a duckaposs back for Grace, who is used to attracting a lot of attention while working as a bikini barista.  In one video, she said: Something nobody ever talks about is the fact that these customers somewhat fall in love with you after one time of meeting you. She added the obsession is often short-lived, with men showering her with gts before losing interest. To demonstrate the intensity of her customersapos feelings, Grace showed some of the gts she claimed to have been given by a man who met her the day before - including a plant, chocolates, a mug that says aposyouaposre my favouriteapos and a bottle of hot sauce. She joked: So now we are in love and it has been one day.  As well as gts, Grace receives generous tips from her punters - but some of them have unusual conditions before handing over the cash. In one video, Grace told viewers a handful of men have asked her to take a sip of the coffee before handing it over. They want my mouth on it and itaposs kind of weird, she said. In another video, she suggests customers have offered to tip her  for spitting in their drink. While she appears to enjoy her job, it can leave Grace in some tricky situations. In one video, she suggests that her friendaposs dad regularly visits her in the coffee cart - and he pays her to keep quiet about it. She has also shared harrowing details of being stalked while working in the coffee cart - which she said forced her to take out a restraining order. However, it seems the perks of the job keep her donning her lingerie every day as she shared a few of the more lavish gts sheaposs received from punters. In one video, she claimed her sofa, her dining room set, her kitchen utensils, her groceries, her bathroom accessories and even an enormous projector have all been gted to her. She said: My customers are lit, thataposs all Iaposm saying.

While some turn to their favourite books, television shows and movies for inspiration, others seek advice from their close friends and family.But one dog owner regrets turning to her dad for help as her dachshundaposs name is constantly being misunderstood by strangers in the street. Sharing her embarrassment on Reddit, the owner explained how her dad named her dog Bag, which translates to Tasche in German.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. The woman can often be heard shouting for her dog in parks when trying to gain her attention, leaving other owners to question the unusual name. She said: Itaposs a funny name for a dog in general but I hate it when people want to know her name from curiosity. Itaposs just awkward for me, especially when they misunderstand her name and I have to repeat it. Wanting to avoid this awkward encounter in the future, the owner is pleading with people to refrain from questioning a dogaposs name when itaposs something they havenapost heard before. If you want to know, for example, the name of the dog of a pedestrian, and itaposs weird, donapost question it, she added.  Hoping to reassure the owner, one person said: You shouldnapost be ashamed of your dogaposs unique name. I doubt that she minds her name. I would suggest not reading too much into peopleaposs curiosity. We named our dog Chipotle after the restaurant. Itaposs an inside joke of my favourite place to eat when I met my we. Most people want to know why, and this gives me an opportunity to have a nice conversation with a stranger. View it as a positive. While another added: If theyaposre strangers you could just ignore them and pretend you donapost hear or understand. If people misunderstand the name that feels normal, buttheyaposre questioning or judging it thataposs not cool and I would just ignore them. Or you could make up a funny story like aposwell sheaposs so ugly that usually we make her wear a bag over her headapos or something ridiculous that freaks people out even more than the name. Sharing their own unusual dog names, one user said: I rarely tell people my dogaposs full name, Finlaggan, because I don’t want questions. The name has deeper meaning to me, but basically sheaposs named after a boat. Another added: My boyfriend has two cats - Gato and Girlfriend. Weird animal names are fun. People always think the name Girlfriend is weird, but he named her that because one day Gato, who used to be a stray, came home with her - and so it was like she was his girlfriend.

Basically, by aposintimateapos it includes things like my crushes and relationships, body issues, social media account infoand even things that I would never willingly share like my porn interests and what I like to look for in a partner. As a child my parents would only preach privacy to me and my siblings, looking back at my childhood I can see that they preached this idea way too much, I guess thataposs why in my mind I would never have expected for my privacy to be breached in this way.Recently the man woke up really thirsty in the middle of the night so decided to head downstairs to grab a drink. But when he got downstairs he claims he was absolutely gobsmacked to find his mum, dad and both his siblings sitting reading his diary.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.I was so confused that I couldnapost utter a single word, I just went up snatched my water bottle and my diary and went back to my room, and just stayed there, he continued. The next day in private I grabbed my parents to another room and asked them what the hell I saw yesterday. At first they tried to play it off as an accident - like what the f*** I literally saw all four people around my diary - but after more pressure they admitted that they have constantly been reading my diary with my SIBLINGS and their excuse was aposwe just want to make sure our son is okayapos. He was understandably furious, but mostly he just felt embarrassed, so he called one of his friends who was looking for a roommate and they agreed he would move in. By the end of the week he had completely left his family home. Once at his house I just broke down and I just couldnapost imagine that all my privacy was breached by the people who would preach respecting privacy to me the most, he continued. My parents tried calling but I ignored them and my siblings keep texting saying Iaposm too sensitive and have even insulted my mentioning some of the private stuff they read in my diary, so I blocked them and also changed all my passwords. The man then turned to Reddit to question whether he was justied in moving out and cutting contact with his family or whether they were right in saying he was too sensitive. What they did is a gross violation of privacy. Good for you for moving out, one Reddit user commented, while another added: Iaposm so sorry this happened to you. I hope you keep journaling and don’t let their breach of your privacy and trust keep you from it in the future. A third replied: They are not family, are literal psychopaths. I donapost comment often, but this level of emotional disregard is truly stunning.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

And while things like morning sickness and cravings are well-documented side effects, there are also many that most people are completely unaware of which can take mums-to-be by surprise. One mum on TikTok facing a particularly bizarre pregnancy side-effect is Carla, who has discovered a strange issue with her skin - as she claims it has become so squishy it now resembles aposuncooked doughapos. In a video showing off her unusual condition, Carla got her husband to push his finger into the skin just above her ankle, and the man was left looking completely baffled when he removed his finger to find the dent heaposd made in her skin had stayed in place.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.Carla, who posts under the username @carlaincarolina, captioned the video: Being pregnant is fun.The mumaposs video has been viewed more than  million times - and commenters canapost get enough of her squidgy skin which many have said looks like dough. One person wrote: I heard many things, but the body turning into clay [is new]. As another commented: Just like dough.  She became memory foam, a third joked.While Carlaaposs side effects may look bizarre, it is actually a fairly common condition faced by pregnant women and is known as pitting oedema, which is a iation of swelling caused by oedema. According to the NHS, oedema is a build-up of fluid in areas including the ankles, feet, and legs, and can often be seen in pregnant women as well as those who are overweight, have been standing or sitting in the same position for too long, or have eaten too much salty food.Oedema can also be caused by some medications, an insect bite, a blood clot, or problems with your kidneys, liver or heart.

Shocked by the owneraposs demands, the dog sitter has shared the pairaposs messages on Imgur with the caption: Rude lady wants me to watch her diabetic dog for basically nothing.Setting out her strict demands, the dog owner writes: I want to make some things abundantly clear because the last few sitters let me down. I will pay you  for your services. You are there to make sure Junie is fed, watered, and medicated. That is a fair price. You are to be there  per cent of the time.

And one woman on TikTok has learned that lesson the hard way after she went to an artist specialising in tribal tattoos for her small and minimalistic design, and was left regretting her decision.Abigail Brady, who is from the US, shared a video in which she showed off the three small birds she wanted inked on her wrist, which were simple black silhouettes with wing and tail details.But instead, Abby received less defined black splodges - which some have compared tochicken footprints .Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.The woman, who posts under the username @abigailkbrady, wrote in her video: Got a tattoo... and it definitely didnapost turn out [how I expected].She also wrote in the clipaposs caption: In the tattoo artists defence, he she specialises in tribal tattoos and not mini tattoos. And commenters were left in stitches by the womanaposs less than ideal inking. One said: It looks like chicken footprints. Oh gosh, noooo, another sympathetic commenter wrote.But Abby is taking the tattoo blunder in her stride, as she replied one comment agreeing that her ink does look like chicken feet, while also telling several others that she plans on having it removed or covered up. She said: Iaposm thinking about getting it removed or covered and starting over, but I donapost know. Abby definitely isnapost the only one of us to have received a bad tattoo, as several others have recently shared their experiences with disastrous inkings online.Earlier this week, we shared how Brittany Lewin was in love with her stylish pineapple tattoo - until she discovered the secret meaning behind the fruit.As it turns out, upside-down pineapples are apparently a secret sign used by swingers to identy those on the lookout for a swinger party - while a pineapple placed on the porch or mailbox of a house also signies a swinger party is currently going on inside. Swingers also reportedly identy each other in public by opting for clothes that feature the tangy tropical fruit. Brittany posted a video on TikTok with the caption: When you realise youaposve made a mistake.The woman also shared screenshots of the messages she exchanged with her friend, who initially asked herher tattoo was of an upside-down pineapple - before hinting that she might want to Google the truth.Check out Abigailaposs website hereDo you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TattoosViralUmm what \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Land Down Under implemented some of the strictest pandemic measures of any democracy back in March .It is the latest in a list of nations that have relaxed their coronavirus rules. Here are some of the countries that have recently changed their travel regulations, as collated by Liverpool Echo.  Australia As of February , , arrivals who are fully vaccinated will not need a travel exemption and will not be made to quarantine. Anyone entering the country is also required to complete an Australia Travel Declaration at least  hours before departure. The ATD includes a declaration regarding your vaccination status and you will be asked to upload your vaccination certicate. Unvaccinated visa holders will still need a valid travel exemption to enter Australia - and these will not be granted solely for tourism purposes.Inbound passengers must also provide a negative accepted Covid- test result.Australian states and territories also have their own Covid- rules, with the strictest enforced by Western Australia state which covers a third of the island continent.  Spain Spain introduced a huge change for holidaymakers this week as children over  from non-EU countries, such as the UK, now do not need to be fully vaccinated against coronavirus to enter the country. The change came into force on Monday, February , ahead of the school half term. Adults who are fully vaccinated and travelling from the UK can enter Spain without needing to test or quarantine regardless of your reason for travel. The country also has new booster jab requirements which mean thatyou completed your vaccination course over nine months ago, youaposll need a booster jab to be considered fully vaccinated. However, adult Brits yet to receive both jabs can only enter the countrytheir reason for travel falls into one of the categories listed as essential. Morocco  After swtly closing its borders in October, Morocco is now welcoming fully vaccinated tourists again. Passengers must also present a negative PCR result, and download, print and sign a passenger health form before arrival in Morocco. Children under the age of  are exempt from the pre-travel PCR test requirement, and children under the age of  are exempt from the requirement to present a vaccine pass. France Only fully vaccinated Brits can visit for holidays without needing to quarantine. The country has scrapped Covid test requirements so fully vaccinated holidaymakers wonapost need a PCR or antigen test to visit.Unvaccinated travellers need an essential reason to visit. There are also new booster jab requirementsyou were vaccinated over  days ago. All passengers will also need to sign a apossworn statementapos confirming they are not showing symptoms of coronavirus, nor have they been in contact with a confirmed case within  days before travel to France.  Norway Norway’s border is now open as it was before the pandemic began. Most restrictions within the country have also been lted. All travellers arriving in Norway must complete registration prior to arrival. This also applies to Norwegian citizens. Arrivals must also take a test upon entering the country, regardless of their vaccination status. . Greece Greece is open to both vaccinated and unvaccinated Brits. Greece recently updated its rules so that fully vaccinated travellers will be exempt from Covid test requirements. Anyone over the age of  will need to fill out a pre-departure passenger locator form. If youaposre unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, you will need to show proof of a negative Covid test result. PCR tests can be taken within  hours of arrival, or antigen tests within  hours of arrival. Israel Israel will now allow unvaccinated tourists to enter from the beginning of next month. Its government announced the rule change on Sunday as the latest wave of the coronavirus recedes. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said that foreign tourists, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, would be required to take PCR coronavirus tests before their flights and upon landing. The rules go into effect on March .

Experts have claimed that he could deploy an arsenal of devastating weapons in his full-scale attack on Ukraine This includes a number of thermobaric weapons that launch a barrage of fuel-air explosive warheads that can aposmeltapos an opposing army. The TOS- Buratino and TOS-A Solntsepek are seen as some of the more dangerous weapons on the modern-day battlefield.The Sun reports that sources in Ukraine shared videos of the bizarre-looking tanks heading for the border with the paper - which are loaded with incendiary or thermobaric rockets. Sebastian Roblin, a military expert, writing for fortyfive, said: A TOS- rocket barrage will wipe out everything within the -by-m blast zone. Click here to follow our live blog with the latest updates This morning, PhD student at the Department of War Studies at Kingaposs College London Rob Lee claimed thermobaric MLRS and other Russian military equipment were entering Ukraine from Belarus. He added: The location suggests they will take part in an operation towards Kyiv. Note the circle markers.According to Military Today, the TOS-A is an improved version of the original TOS- heavy flamethrower system. It was adopted by the Russian Army in .It is a - or -barrel multiple rocket launcher and thermobaric weapons mounted on a T- tank chassis.  They are used to clear out buildings, field fortications and bunkers, and are generally similar to multiple launch rocket systems, however they have a shorter firing range. Meanwhile the TOS- Buratino features thermobaric warheads, which create waves of pressure. The blast is lethal in itself, but the vacuum that follows the explosion is strong enough to cause deadly internal damage, including rupturing of vital organs, such as a persons lungs. The self-propelled multiple rocket launcher system can destroy several city blocks in one hit, causing indiscriminate damage Defence and national security commentator Charlie Gao added: The Buratino and Solntsepek are very useful weapons for a military that might be going into urban combat with little regard for collateral damage. It comes as Russian military forces have launched a major assault on Ukraine, with reports of missile strikes in major cities, and the country declared a state of emergency.  The attack began in the early hours of the morning, and videos in Ukraineaposs capital, Kiev show gridlocked roads as residents flee. Officials in the US claimed two days ago that Russian officials have been stockpiling blood - fuelling war fears. Putin previously gave a chilling warning that “weapons without parallel in the world have been put on combat duty”. His warning was delivered on Defender of the Fatherland Day - originally a Soviet-era holiday for men who served in the Red Army. It comes just a few days days after the leader watched missiles capable of striking across thousands of miles in fresh tests on Saturday. “We will continue to develop advanced weapons systems - including hypersonic, Putin warned in the video.

The video which quickly went viral was filmed at Suzhou, a city in northern Anhui province of China which recently celebrated the beginning of the Year of the Tiger. But after it was seen by local media, the zoo was asked for a comment about people petting the tiger and defended itself saying visitors had been acting illegally. It claimed they should not have been reaching over the wooden barrier to stroke the little cub. A spokesman said that the wooden fence had been put in place according to expert specications, which made it clear that the height selected was too high for the tiger cub to climb over.But they had not taken into account that visitors would lean over in order to scratch its head. People shared videos and pictures noting how exciting it was to scratch a real-le tiger on the head. The video footage also showed people trying to interest the clearly nervous cub in some toys - with a plastic windmill being poked in its face at one point. The zoo added that although not allowed, it was not dangerous for visitors as the tiger cub was born in captivity to domesticated parents and was not as dangerous as a wild tiger cub would be.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left.

There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

This is particularly good advice for anyone with a veg plot.A sowing plan of what seeds and how many to sow each month is key to successful growing and means you won#t be throwing out unwanted seedlings and that your flower and veg beds will be full all year round.A word of warning about sowing direct into the ground at this time of year there may be a few sunny days to enjoy outside but the soil can still be chilly, making germination and survival hard.Sowing indoors is a better option. Not only does it provide a warm environment for germination, but seeds and seedlings are easier to protect from pests. If you can find some environmentally sound sowing trays and containers, rather than using plastic, that#s even better. Paper and cardboard pots can be packed snugly in a tray which avoids over handling and makes them easy to water.Small seeds should be scattered sparingly on the surface of compost filled seed trays then covered with a sprinkling of sieved compost. If the seeds are big enough to handle, you can sow them inidually into cm pots. The quantity should be according to the instructions specied on the seed packet, but usually for small seeds between five and  seeds per pot. For plants that grow long roots, such as peas or beans, you can put them into a compost filled cardboard toilet roll tube and, once ready, they can be planted outside, tube and all.Most seeds will germinate and grow in a warm setting such as a greenhouse, cold frame or on a sunny windowsill. You should keep them damp by using a mist spray to start with before moving onto a watering can with a fine rose nozzle.Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. Simply ease out a clump of seedlings with an old cutlery fork or dibber and # handling only the leaves to avoid damaging delicate stems and roots # gently tease them apart. Drop inidual seedlings into a five-centimetre compost filled newspaper pot ensuring the lower leaves are above the compost level. Once you see roots appearing from the bottom of the pot, it’s time to pot on to a bigger pot before planting outside once the weather and soil warms up.If you are growing your own veg, now is a good time to sow first early potatoes. These can be planted from mid-March, however planting times will y across the country according to temperature and risk of frost. Early potatoes grow well in the ground and in containers such as potato grow bags or old compost bags. You should plant your chitted potatoes with the shoots facing upwards in soil with plenty of well-rotted organic matter, approximately cms deep and cms apart.Once stems are about cms tall, they will need earthing up by drawing soil around them to create a cm high ridge, to protect against frost and keep growing potatoes covered. Good ieties of early potatoes are: Swt # good for containers, white skinned and white fleshed Annabelle # nutty flavour with firm waxy yellow flesh and Maris Bard # white flesh with good #new potato# flavour and drought resistance.Spring seems tantalisingly close in March, particularly as work in the garden starts to get going again.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring usually arrives by mid-March and the frequent sunny days provide the opportunity for an increasing range of gardening tasks. It#s time to get busy preparing seed beds, sowing seed, cutting back winter shrubs and generally tidying up around the garden.Top three jobs in March:PICS:Once the seedlings have grown their second pair of leaves and before they get too squashed in seed trays or pots, pot them on into small pots. no_aGardening_March"},{"url":null,"title":"tourism drive builds urban and rural links","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

did Nicola Sturgeon say today Free PCR testing to continue in ScotlandNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the healthbudget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”.remove: Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rulesNew Covid Strategic FrameworkThis weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”Covid isolation to continuePeople who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination updateVaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform websitefor more information.Vaccine Passport SchemeThe First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .Face covering restrictions to end on March The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transportwill end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Latest Covid casesToday, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegvpic WCZTIZVjw— Scottish GovernmentFebruary , The First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"Gigs in Scotland has today released the newsthat Calvin Harris will be coming to Scotland.The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"\" fill\"#\"View this post on InstagramtranslateY\"translateX translateYwidth: .pxflex-grow: margin-right: pxmargin-left: px\"translateY\"translateY rotate\"\"\"translateX\"A post shared by Gigs in Scotland The DJ and producer will also be ing to Creamfields this summer.

In doing so, we are offering no mere conventional respect to a great public figure who has passed from us.#We did not think of George VI as a monarch living in high places, remote from the lives of the ordinary men and women of this realm.#Such was his le and character that his passing came as personal grief to everyone of his loyal subjects. We think today of a man who served us all with the highest and most self-sacricing sense of duty and probably beyond the limits of his strength – a man of complete integrity and of great personal courage and endurance.#His le exemplied the virtues on which, as we all know, the welfare of our nation depends. What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man. His consideration, courtesy and kindliness, combined with his deep interest in the welfare of his people in Argyll impressed me to the full and are an indelible memory.Campbeltown Town Council resolved into a special public session during the committee meetings on Monday night to offer their respectful sympathy, devotion and loyalty to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, The Queen Mother and members of the Royal Family.Provost R Wallace Greenlees, who presided, rose to remind members of the Town Council of #the sorrowful time# through which the nation was passing and to ask them to approve of the following resolution:The resolution was unanimously carried.These addresses were duly sealed with the Common Seal of the Royal Burgh of Campbeltown and signed in name and on behalf of the Provost, Magistrates and Councillors by Provost R Wallace Greenlees and by Mr A I B Stewart, Town Clerk.Among the messages of condolence sent to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth were:The Lord Lieutenant has received the following acknowledgement from Her Majesty the Queen: #Am sincerely grateful for your message.

in line with a declining population, but previously demolished buildings in adjacent areas – Saddell Street and Queen Street – are now unsightly gap-sites.Local opinion is important, given what has happened in the wake of recent housing demolition. There is concern, often heard in local conversation and frequently discussed on Facebook, of what might happen in the latest round of town planning.To be fair, plans are afoot to replace the same with modern housing – probably less stock to suit the demands that exist in the town at the moment – however, it is really important any proposed build be sensitive in design to suit this prime parkland location, an area fronting onto Kinloch Park and town#s seafront Esplanade.I share this concern, given the results of previous

grappling with a cost of living crisis.On Thursday, Ofgem announced that from April the energy price cap would rise  per cent to £, – that is an extra £ households will have to find just to keep their homes warm and the lights on.Forthcoming increases to the interest rate and rises in National Insurance payments will exacerbate the situation.It is heart-breaking. I have had food bank helpers in tears saying we can#t wait another year for the Right to Food to kick in. People need help now.Food bank volunteers need assurance that the invaluable support they provide in their communities will end one day, when wages and benefits are adequate enough for proud families to be able to stop using the food banks.New statistics show rising homelessness across Scotland.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season. The quantity required will y with soil type, but  to  litres per square metre – four to six watering cans – each week in dry weather will do the trick.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to sow lettuce seeds – both under cover and outside.If you start now, it will give you a continuous supply that can be harvested throughout the year.Sow in modules or fibre pots under cover to have lettuces ready to plant outside in four to six weeks. You can also sow outdoors, but use cloches or small poly tunnels until next month when the soil has warmed up.

Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"argyll and bute citizens advice invite private renters","story":"Did you know, the Scottish Government is currently consulting on ‘The New Deal for Tenants’  Argyll and Bute Citizens Advice Bureau wants to see the challenges local people face when renting privately aren’t overlooked.This is a particularly dficult area to secure affordable private rentals and CAB wants to take this opportunity to let local people share their experiences of the private rental sector.Have your say at https:www.smartsurvey s HVJLF Or, to have your say in other ways telephone   or email info@abcab.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"town causes to land co op cash","story":"Thanks to Co-op members choosing the supermarket#s own-branded products and services, over £ million has been raised for more than , causes since .Each year, members are encouraged to pick a local cause in their community that supports access to food, mental wellbeing support or opportunities for young people, helping to build stronger, more resilient communities across the UK.In Tarbert, Fèis an Tairbeirt, Tarbert Soccer Centre and Tarbert After School Care are to receive grants and, in Mid Argyll, Argyll and Bute Befrienders, Mid-Argyll Transport Volunteers and Mid Argyll Multiple Sclerosis Centre will benefit.#We know that this year is going to be another incredibly challenging year for local causes and communities,# said Rebecca Birkbeck, director of community and membership at the Co-op.#With the cost of living rising dramatically already this year, charities are likely to bear the brunt of people being more conscious about their spending.#At the Co-op, we work hard to bring people together to ‘co-operate for a fairer world’.

customers and are satisfied that there would not be a signicant impact on traffic movements to and from the premises.“Road services did not raise any concerns in respect of construction traffic during the construction phase.“On the matter of parking, the council’s road services are satisfied that the existing rear car park is appropriate for continued use.“However, they request that the parking

including Victorian Trout Conspiracy and racecar.However, with live performances shelved due to the Covid- pandemic, it allowed him time to put pen to paper and start piecing together his own album, Panopticon.He said: “I have always been a songwriter.“The bands I perform bass for, I tend to write songs for the bands.“That was always, I suppose, specic to the band and their genre or style and what they do.“It was time for me to do something that was much more up my own alley musically.“I had done solo stuff but never taken it too seriously or had enough time, either side of doing performing and being involved in bands, to pursue it properly.“It was really during the pandemic and being in lockdown that gave me time and space to put some energy into doing my own stuff.“There was definitely a silver lining to the pandemic.“[Usually] you are choc-a-bloc playing gigs and don’t have much time for creative endeavour, especially for your own thing.“It was nice to have a little bit of time to work on that.”The former Knox Academy pupil’s love of music was established when he was a teenager.He attended the Bridge Centre’s Music Project and started playing bass, going on to form punk funk band Edelweiss Pirates with friends.Growing up on Haddington’s Burnside, Calum would then go on to study music at Edinburgh Napier University.The  tracks on his new album were recorded at Venice of the North Studios in Glasgow.Now, after writing, arranging and recording the songs for his debut album, he is waiting on the finished product arriving at his home in the Capital.Calum told the Courier: “I guess I would describe the music as alternative rock with a hint of folk music, as well as traditional music.“I guess I was influenced by a bunch of bands when I was younger and this has carried on through.“I was interested in the Seattle grunge scene and all the alternative rock that came out of that like Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and then I started enjoying Queens Of The Stone Age, Foo Fighters, Radiohead and bands like that.“In terms of songwriters, I am a really big fan of Nick Cave, Tom Waits and the Scottish songwriter John Martyn as well.”As lockdown restrictions ease, the -year-old is hopeful of putting a band together and performing Panopticon, which is released on March , live.He said: “Of course, that’s the actual plan.“In this day and age, you don’t know what is going to happen but that is on the cards!”"},{"url":null,"title":"jackie-bird-visits-newhailes-house-musselburgh-new-podcast-series","story":"Jackie Bird hosted an episode of the series, which tells

decided to highlight five of their favourites that definitely cheer them up!PrimrosesFor a quick splash of colour, you can’t go wrong with primroses.There’s a vast selection available at this time of year and, with an almost infinite palette of colour, it can be dficult to choose your favourites.These low-growing plants are very robust and tolerant of the typically challenging weather we get at this time of year.Although mainly sold for immediate colour, it’s entirely possible that you’ll be able to enjoy their flowers again next year.Their close relative, the polyanthus, is also very striking at this time of year, with a main stem bearing its flowers a few inches off the ground and,you need some height, these could be the answer.HelleboresSometimes known as the Christmas rose, these native woodland perennial plants are ideal for shady corners and under trees.Depending on the iety, they’ll flower from November to February and come back bigger and better year after year.They’re available in a wide range of colours, from the original white to the more modern deep purples and speckled flowers that are so popular today.As always, the key to getting the best from your plant is to consider its native conditions and replicate that where possible. As hellebores are native to woodland, they’ll enjoy plenty of organic matter, so make sure you add some when planting and add mulch from time to time to help retain the moisture in the soil. If you’re planting under trees, they will have to compete for water so you may need to provide water until it is well established. Once it’s well-rooted, the organic matter in the soil, the mulch and its broad leaves will generally maintain adequate moisture levels, although you may need to water occasionallythere’s a particularly dry spell.The real bonus with the hellebore is that, as a perennial, it will continue to grow bigger over time and after a few years you’ll be able to ide it into several plants – and all gardeners just love free plants!Garrya ellipticaSometimes known as the ‘silk tassel’ bush, this medium-sized evergreen shrub is native to coastal areas of America and so it’s quite happy in East Lothian gardens, where salty winds from the North Sea can be testing for our plants.This easy-to-grow shrub is a great addition to the garden, providing a backdrop to the vibrant colours in the summer garden. However, it really comes into its own in the winter garden, when the glossy green leaves provide welcome foliage and an abundance of beautul silk-like tassels at this time of year.Jasminum nudlorumMore commonly known as the winter-flowering jasmine, this deciduous shrub is unusual in that it flowers before producing its foliage.A robust, medium-sized shrub, it’s often trained against a wall or used as ground cover. It is happy in coastal areas and so ideal for our East Lothian gardens.The bright yellow flowers give a wonderful show at this time of year and are a sure sign that spring is on its way! It’s very easy to grow and tolerant of a wide range of conditions.CamelliaSometimes called the Japanese rose, camellias have been cultivated in Chinese and Japanese gardens for many centuries. When the tea trade expanded in the late s, Camellias were imported by the British East India Company for the wealthy British owners and by the s they were considered to be the luxury flower and the height of fashion.With its glossy green leaves and stunning flowers, the evergreen camellia is one of the first shrubs to flower each year.One of our most popular garden plants, it can be grown as a shrub or small tree, and comes in a huge range of dferent shapes, sizes and flower colours. It grows well in both containers and borders, but don’t forget that they prefer acidic soil. If your soil isn’t naturally acidic, add plenty of ericaceous compost around the roots when planting and maintain the pH level by feeding with fertiliser for acid-loving plants.Just one interesting fact – did you know that the most widely grown camellia on earth is the commercial crop, Camellia sinensis  Grown for its leaves, Camellia sinensis is none other than the tea plant, whose leaves are harvested for tea drinkers around the world!Hopefully we’ve given you some ideas that’ll help you add interest to your garden in February. If you’d like more information, please do call in and have a chat with our knowledgeable and experienced plant team – we just love to talk gardening!"},{"url":null,"title":"m-s-pancake-day-2022-range-including-percy-pig-frying-pan-mixes-sauces-spreads","story":"The Percy Pig Pancake Pan is £ and comes with a pancake batter squeezy bottle for precise batter application.MS is also selling a Pancake Party Gt Bag for £ which includes two pancake mixes, maple syrup and recipe cards.In the offer you will get: class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaFpVBuqJbd  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

Stephen is passionate about pet nutrition.He said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Stephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.If you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s

month.However, the transfer has now been put back and is unlikely to happen before April.A council spokesperson said: “We are working very closely with Cruden Homes, who are developing the first -unit phase of new council housing on the Blindwells site.“We are aware of delays in the construction of these homes due to ious material supply and labour issues caused by a combination of Covid-, the impact of Brexit and the Suez Canal blockage crisis.“However, we currently expect handover of the first  units in April.”The Suez Canal is a vital waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea to provide the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe.  It was blocked for six days last March after sea vessel the Ever Given became wedged across it.Hundreds of container vessels and ships were caught up in the logjam created by the blockage, which put the canal – which sees about  per cent of global trade pass through it each day – out of action.The construction industry across Scotland has also been hit by worldwide material shortages, as well as staffing issues caused by the pandemic.The new Blindwells settlement, which sits between Prestonpans, Tranent and Longniddry, is expected to have , homes in total, with further land expected to be expanded into in the future.Under East Lothian Council’s planning policy,  per cent of new housing built by any developer must be affordable.At a virtual meeting of the council this week, it was revealed that the local authority had been expecting to deliver  new council houses in this financial year but delays at Blindwells were likely to have an effect on that final figure.In addition, the council had added  registered social landlordhousing units and  mid-market retail properties.Head of housing Wendy McGuire said

address Boris Johnsons Living with Covid policy and the scrapping of all Coronavirus restrictions in England as of Thursday.This week, Nicola Sturgeon announced her Covid strategic framework also known as a roadmap out of Coronavirus restrictions.Heres what Ms Sturgeon said during her Covid briefing today.Today First Minister @NicolaSturgeon will give an update to @ScotParl on #coronavirus.Watch live ➡️ https:t.co zWDxpMyAe from :pm. pic LKTccbDImNicola Sturgeon expressed frustration over Boris Johnsons approach to Covid testing that he outlined on Monday.The Scottish Government is \"determined to retain\" free Covid testing, in contrast to England.Nicola Sturgeon criticised the decision by Boris Johnson to end universally free testing and said that the Scottish Government was looking for clarity on funding for the testing programme for devolved countries.Ms Sturgeon said: “Current funding arrangements mean that though taxpayers in all four UK nations contribute to the costs, it is decisions taken for England that determine the resources available to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for testing and other Covid measures.“As of now, we have no clarity on how much of the Covid testing infrastructure the UK government intends to retain no clarity on how much investment will support it in future and no clarity on whether the Treasury will provide additional resources to pay for it or demand instead that funding is taken from where in the health budget.“I hope we get this clarity soon so that we can out in more detail our longer-term approach to testing.“However, and I will say more later, I want to give an assurance that the Scottish Government is determined to retain a robust testing system capable of providing Scotland with strong resilience against future Covid threats, and firmly aligned with public health advice and the principles underpinning our National Health Service.”                                                                                                              : Nicola Sturgeon update LIVE as Covid roadmap published: Covid Scotland: Vaccine passports scrapped and changes to face mask rules                                                                                                              This weeks announcement coincides with the publication of the Scottish Governments Covid strategic framework.Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government’s strategy was now to “manage Covid effectively, primarily through adaptations and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery”.In her statement to MSPs, the First Minister said: “Widespread vaccination coverage and better treatments have reduced the direct harms of the virus.“As a result, using restrictions to suppress infection is no longer as necessary as it once was.“And, given the wider harms caused by protective measures, it is no longer as justiable either.“The strategic framework therefore makes clear that in future we will rely less on legally imposed measures to control the virus – and more on vaccines, treatments, and sensible adaptations and good public health behaviours.”The framework sets out three broad levels on how the Government may respond to potential iants that could see restrictions reimposed, Nicola Sturgeon had said.Setting out the contingency strategy for low, medium and high risks, the First Minister told MSPs: “If a new iant emerged that was more transmissible and more severe, perhaps with the ability to evade vaccine or natural immunity, this would likely be classied as high risk.\"In those circumstances, we might advise people to limit social contacts for a period and to work from home where possible and we may introduce some temporary protections for high-risk settings.“If a new iant was either more transmissible or more severe, but not both, as is the case with Omicron, the initial threat assessment would likely be medium.\"In these circumstances, there may be a legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings and we might issue guidance for businesses and service providers on reasonable measures to reduce the spread of Covid on their premises.“Lastly, in the absence of a new iant, ora new iant was neither more transmissible nor more severe, andvaccines continue to be effective, the threat classication would likely remain low. Obviously, this is the level we hope to reach and stay at on a sustainable basis.“In these circumstances, there would be no legally imposed protective measures. Instead, we would continue to advise iniduals and organisations to adopt sensible public health behaviours.”People who test positive for Covid- should continue to isolate in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed.The legal requirement for infected people to self-isolate in England will be lted from Thursday, Boris Johnson announced on Monday.Although there has never been a legal requirement in Scotland, Ms Sturgeon said the guidance to isolate would remain.In her update to the Scottish Parliament, Ms Sturgeon said: “This new approach will see us resort much less, hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures.“Instead, we will rely predominantly on vaccines, treatments and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.“However much as we might wish it was not the case, Covid is still a public health risk here and globally and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future so we must also remain vigilant and prepared.”Vaccination appointments for the vulnerable - age group will begin in mid-March.--year-olds with an underlying health condition or who lives with those who with underlying conditions should come forward for their vaccine.Eligible children are being invited for their vaccination by NHS Scotland via letter or phone call.These appointments will be concentrated for evenings and weekends so that parents and s can attend.Visit the NHS Inform website for more information.The First Minister has been under pressure from hospitality bosses to scrap Scotlands vaccine passport scheme for late-night bars and clubs.Leaders in the hospitality industry have been demanding an end to the legal requirement for customers and staff to wear face masks in licensed premises.In her update today, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that the vaccine passport scheme will end on February .The face-covering legal requirement in shops and on public transport will end on March , Nicola Sturgeon has announced.Ms Sturgeon said: “As of March , assuming no signicant adverse developments in the course of the virus, we expect that the legal requirement to wear face coverings in certain indoor settings and on public transport will be converted to guidance.“However, we will continue to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops and other indoor public places, and on public transport.”She added: “Even though certain measures, for example face coverings, may not be legal requirements in future, we will still recommend voluntary compliance as part of the range of behaviours that will help keep us safe as we manage Covid in a more sustainable and less restrictive way.”Today, , more people have tested positive for #coronavirus, people were in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before.Sadly  more people who tested positive have died Latest update ➡️ https:t.co YnREdCegv pic WCZTIZVjwThe First Minister also updated MSPs on the latest Covid figures., more people have tested positive for Coronavirus today, Nicola Sturgeon said.There were , people in hospital yesterday which is  more than the day before and  people were in intensive care yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-. more people who tested positive have sadly died which brings the total to , in total.Looking towards vaccination, ,, people have received their first dose of a COVID- vaccination, ,, have received their second dose, and ,, have received a third dose or booster.For more information, visit the Scottish Government website."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-announces-mystery-scottish-gig---get-tickets","story":"The musician will be coming to Scotland in summer , but as of yet the location has been kept secret.Those interested in attending can sign up for an exclusive pre-sale on the Ticketmaster website.Harris has not given any hint to the performance on his own social media.The show is part of a number of gigs he will be performing this year, including  exclusive shows in Ibiza.class\"instagram-media\"data-instgrm-captioneddata-instgrm-permalink\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"data-instgrm-version\"\"style\"background: #fffborder: border-radius: pxbox-shadow:   px  rgba,  px px  rgbamargin: pxmax-width: pxmin-width: pxpadding: width: .%width: -webkit-calcwidth: calc\"href\"https:www.instagram p CaT_TVTsE_  utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading utm_sourceig_embedutm_campaignloading\"style\"background: #ffffffline-height: padding:  text-align: centertext-decoration: nonewidth: %\"target\"_blank\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: %flex-grow: height: pxmargin-right: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: flexflex-direction: columnflex-grow: justy-content: center\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxmargin-bottom: pxwidth: px\"style\"background-color: #fffborder-radius: pxflex-grow: height: pxwidth: px\"style\"display: block height: px margin:  auto px width: px\"width\"px\"\"px\"viewBox\"   \"version\".\"xmlns\"https:www.w.org  svg\"xmlns:xlink\"https:www.w.org  xlink\"\" fill\"#\"d\"M.,.

With no formal education his innovative ideas and shrewd business sense he has created a name for himself as the brains behind the iconic luxury Edinburgh Cashmere brand, as well as Edinburgh Lambswool and DC Milan.Not only that, but for the past five years, he has been focusing his attention on the development of healthy fast food, with an exciting new ‘DC Tasty’ franchise in the making and expected to launch in the near future.Another of DC’s latest business ventures has seen him expand into the technology sector, working hard behind the scenes to create a mobile taxi app which will see taxi drivers making more money and customers making huge savings as well as being environmentally friendly. It’s an exciting new project set to launch imminently, and could well turn out to be DC’s most lucrative yet. Set to be the first of many new app-related products, he’s remaining tight-lipped about what  we can expect in that respect - but no doubt, all will be revealed before long.Working with multinational businesses and investors and providing companies and brands with advice on how to develop their businesses to a higher level, so experienced is DC in the entrepreneurial space that he is now using his know-how to help others to see success. But he didn’t arrive at this privileged point in le overnight, and it has taken over fourteen years of hard work, trial and error, and risk-taking to get to where he is today.It all began back in  when, whilst working as a sales assistant, DC was the first person to recognise that Edinburgh had the largest number of cashmere shops in the world. It was this that sparked his inspiration to create the brand Edinburgh Cashmere, and he wasted no time in bringing his brainwave to fruition.It took hour upon hour of relentless research and endless time and attention to achieve his goal of becoming one of the top designers, manufacturers and wholesalers of pure cashmere and pure lambswool in the UK and Europe - and only recently, DC has gone on to successfully launch Edinburgh Cashmere in The United Arab Emirates and also soon to launch in the USA. One of his major accomplishments was to be the first person in the world to produce  dferent clan cashmere scarves - something of which he is understandably very proud.DC oversees every aspect of his production, from designing through to completion, in his own factory, as well as dealing directly with sustainable cashmere and lambswool farms, ensuring luxury quality and value goes into each and every product. His speciality is his up-to-the-minute designs in Monogram and Jacquard, featuring his DC monogram logo - which have become instantly recognisable to fans of his work, and immensely popular, too.He also created what he describes as one of the worlds most famous designs - the DC Classic Check. His new  collection of scarves, stoles and capes is set to make waves in the fashion industry over the coming months, and with a quick glance at what is in store, it’s easy to see why.DC’s passion for quality has allowed him to collaborate with multi-millionaire Italian and French fashion brand companies on a iety of high-profile projects, having recently branched out into supplying premier football clubs with merchandise.As we said, he certainly isn’t one to rest on his laurels, and when it comes to business, it seems his inspired ideas just keep on coming. He has also gone on to successfully create and launch men’s fashion brand DC Milan menswear, which specialises in jeans, sweatshirts and jackets - and each and every piece is designed and manufactured from scratch by DC himself. Each garment is painstakingly embellished with original, hand finished embroidery, one of which is the iconic Celtic Horse design symbolising winning and victory - something that ensures his work always stands out from the crowd.DC’s passion for quality and design has, in his words, allowed him to take his companies and brands to international levels in a short time. His business acumen and celebrity status have even seen himself and his company’s brands appearing in the likes of prestigious media titles like GQ, Tatler, Grazia and both the UK and USA editions of Vogue.DC’s hard work and dogged determination have certainly merited him to call himself \"the proud owner of his many prosperous businesses’’. Every business he has created is a massive success. And it seems that as far as his business endeavours are concerned, he still has many more, DC’s original and inspirational ideas are endless.With an exciting year ahead as he continues to branch out from the fashion world into building, food and technology, his track record means we can expect nothing less than to see big things from DC. And with his new taxi app and healthy fast food franchise likely to be only the tip of the iceberg, we can’t wait to see what he comes up with next.This article was brought to you by DC Singhwww.edinburghcashmere  www.edinburghlambswool  www.dcmilan  www.dcsingh Instagram https:www.instagram dcsingh_  Facebook  https:www.facebook dcsinghd Twitter  https:twitter dcsingh_ s"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13509282.jpg?type=article-full","title":"rare-dolls-house-sells-47-000","story":"The Evans Baby House sold for £, at auction in Edinburgh today.

Businesses and service providers will also no longer have to retain customer contact details.The news came after the First Minister explained the revised strategic approach to the pandemic. This involves a transition from trying to eliminate or suppress the virus to a managing it “primarily through adaptions and health measures that strengthen our resilience and recovery.”Ms Sturgeon said: “The new approach will see us resort much less, and hopefully not at all, to legally imposed protective measures. Instead we will rely predominately on vaccines, treatments, and sensible public health behaviours and adaptations.”While she said the vaccination programme’s success exceeded expectations, there are more than , over s in Scotland who had a second dose, but not a third or booster.Linked to this is the plan to extend the scope of vaccination to include –-year-olds, with appointments being issued for this group from mid-March.On Monday, the government also accepted advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationthat those most at risk will receive an additional booster six months after their last jag. Appointments for this will also start in March.More to follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Glasgow scrum-half’s rise was highlighted by his involvement with the British  Irish Lions last summer while he was named as one of Scotland’s two vice-captains for the Autumn Test against Tonga in the absence of Hogg.

The pair have bonded brilliantly and are inseparable.“This is the first calf to be born to mum Ada as part of an endangered species breeding programme and she’s doing a wonderful job of caring for her new baby. She regularly feeds her, cleans her and even gives her gentle nudges of encouragement, it’s a real joy to watch.” Okapi were only discovered in  and, because of their elusive nature, the species is nicknamed the African unicorn.Threats such as habitat loss, hunting and civil unrest in the DRC have resulted in % of the okapi population being wiped out in the last  years.Rare okapi born… and its a girl! 💜This is Kora the on her adorable first outdoor adventure 😍Zookeeper Rosie tells us why this birth is so incredibly special 💬Read the full story ⬇️https:t.co trqiaiYk#chesterzoo pic PnjxUsdgqR— Chester ZooFebruary , An estimated , of the animals remain in the wild and the  International Union for the Conservation of Naturehas classied the species as endangered.Animal and plant director at Chester Zoo Mike Jordan said: “With only  okapis in zoos across the UK, and five of those being here at Chester, the arrival of Kora is a huge cause for celebration for this magnicent species.“The okapi is one of the animal kingdom’s most mysterious creatures, and it has sadly undergone a huge decline over the last few decades, with numbers of reported sightings becoming less common.“Its last remaining stronghold in the eastern DRC is an area of regular conflict and civil unrest – making conservation projects in the field extremely challenging.“There’s now an increasing amount of pressure on modern zoos, like ours, to help boost numbers in conservation breeding programmes and care for a safety-net population to ensure its continued survival.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Certainly from my experience from playing with Courtney, when he has something to say people tend to tune in a little bit more closely and really focus in.“Neither of us change the way we play because of becoming captain. It’s very much trying to lead by example and doing our jobs as a player before perhaps thinking of the captaincy roles.”Askedhe had been in touch with Lawes this week via text, Biggar said: “Only earlier on in the week. I am actually on the scrounge for a couple of tickets!“It’s funny when England versus Wales comes around, everyone comes out of the woodwork and wants a few tickets!“He will be able to get a few more than me, and I am sure I will touch base with him later on.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

So large was the crowd wishing to attend, that the doors had to be closed and hundreds were unable to attend, a report reads.By this time the club was renamed the Victoria Amateur Swimming Club and Le-Saving Society and, in , the Victoria-Ormeau Ladies Club amalgamated with the club, as mixed bathing was becoming the norm.The Belfastmet up with club members June McKee, who is in her early s, Brigid Blackand Dorcas Peshkin who — despite being  years young — only retired from being a swimming instructor at the onset of the pandemic.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Brigid#s mother, Mary Cummings, who passed away in , was the club#s treasurer for many years, while Dorcas and June served tenures as secretaries.I first started with the club in , when I was knee-high to a daisy, with my brother, who would have been friends with Dorcas, June said.Dorcas and the older ladies were great swimmers and I was a bit of a fill-in, I tortured them! Over the years the numbers of members went down. Kids these days aren#t as interesting in swimming, it#s all football, football, football. I think swimming is better for kids — football is not going to save their le.My fondest memories of the club are back in the s with Dorcas and my brother and everyone, going to galas every weekend. It was such a great time. It#s a shame we couldn#t keep it going, because so many people like us were raised through the club.Dorcas joined the club with her brothers in the s and says she loved training and the competitive era of the club.I made le-long friends and a lot of champions came out of Victoria. I was a breast stroke and butterfly swimmer and swam in the Irish Championships and was an Ulster Champion — I always seemed to come second in the Irish! she said.I was club secretary for ten years and you do make great friendships in swimming. Although I don#t come much these days, I have other interests, Dorcas said with a smile, It is the end of an era.There was so much of a social le to it. We would go to Dublin or Cork or wherever for the championships and there were always dances afterwards — or we would run the championships over again in the sea for packets of crisps. The one thing about swimming clubs was they were always very mixed.”The club later moved to the old Grove Baths on the Shore Road, which was later demolished to make way for the current Grove Wellbeing Centre.In recent years, however, logistical problems and dwindling numbers has resulted in Victoria Swimming Club making the sad decision to disband.Brigid’s family ran a grocery and bakery on the Antrim Road and her mother first heard about the club from a customer.It was very turbulent times on the Antrim Road so we loved coming down to the Grove.”Most ReadMan found dumped in Co Antrim field was stabbed near heart and attacked with hatchet after row over drugs, court toldSchools# Cup hockey semi-finals: Methody to face Armagh Royal in final after tight victories at Comber RoadSammy Wilson confuses Ukraine with Sinn Fein in House of CommonsShow respect for stage performers, says comic John Linehan, after Lyric Theatre show halted due to audience behaviourDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson ‘was in discussions’ to quit the partyTop VideosPlayResident of eastern Ukraine city films shellingPlayBelfast wakes up to a blanket of snowPlayQueues of cars leaving Kyiv as Putin launches war on UkraineLatest Northern IrelandMore clarity needed before free Covid testing is reduced: SwannPutin’s regime ‘needs to be sanctioned into the Stone Age’, says Ukrainian Irish speaker who studied in NIDerry Girls creator and Sky TV reporter among Ulster University honourary graduatesInquest date set for US honeymooner killed in crash near Dark HedgesHealth minister issues direct plea to parties to sort out budgetLatestPandemic not fully behind us but signs of recovery – DonohoeMyleene Klass on now making a ‘very loud noise’ about sexual harassmentGregor Townsend wants Scotland to seize Six Nations ‘last chance’ against FranceRare okapi calf steps outside for the first timeMore clarity needed before free Covid testing is reduced: Swann,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This was a warning sign of things to come as just moments later McCoubrey managed to put the ball into the net courtesy of the outside of his right boot after a scramble in the box.Again, Carryduff showed their resilience and still relied on their counterattacks, the latest coming from captain Conway, although his misjudged pass denied team-mate David Quigley a chance at goal.The pressure would continue to mount on the Carryduff back line and soon it was - as McCoubrey registered his second of the match mdash albeit through an unorthodox but neat finish.Celtic defender Blaine Connolly saw his effort fantastically thwarted by Carryduff lsquokeeper Leggett, who pounced to the bottom right corner of his net with a strong outstretched arm to deny further punishment.The weather began to give its input into the game as temperatures ped bitterly and the wind began to blow harshly at intervals.Although this cannot be cited as the determining factor in this contest by any stretch of the imagination, it certainly played its part when Carryduffrsquos Emmet Curran saw his through ball carried beyond its intended target.Carryduff did manufacture a rare breakaway and it looked asstriker Jonathan Wilkinson would open the away sidersquos account when a pass from midfield left him with just lsquokeeper Curran to beat.However, an impressive last-ditch tackle from defender Gary Carberry allowed the Celtic number five to hook the ball to safety, thus further frustrating the opposition.Celticrsquos Shaun Megahey saw his left-footed effort saved before Carryduffrsquos Joseph McBrien swept up the loose ball and in the last notable action of the half, Conway witnessed his lowly struck effort palmed away from danger by the Hoopsrsquo number one.As the second half kicked off, the home side showed no signs of relenting as they pushed for more goals.Conaill Kerr saw his point-blank effort superbly saved from six yards by lsquokeeper Leggett, who, despite the score line, made numerous contributions to prevent his side conceding into double figures.This over-eagerness from the hosts would cost them as they were caught short at the back, leaving Raymond Grant unmarked  yards from goal.The striker quickly picked his spot and unleashed a lovely curled effort into the top right hand corner to get his side off the mark.Unfortunately for Carryduff, this was as good as it got as Celtic replied almost immediately with McMahon grabbing his second of the matchafter rounding the lsquokeeper for an easy tap in.Things went from bad to worse for the away team when Stephen Galbraith slipped a pass into the path of team-mate Conaill Kerr, who made no mistake with his finish in the one-on-one scenario.At this point Carryduff were aiming for damage limitation but Celtic smelt blood. McMahon completed his hat-trick with an eye-catching acrobatic effort before McCoubrey, tapped in his third of the day.Hoops defender Carberry picked up a yellow card after some unsavoury words with the official and captain Michael Rice was left red-faced after midfielder Curran knocked the ball between his legs, but the home outfit didnrsquot let that deter them from their onslaught.Carberry atoned for his booking in the form of a late header from a Galbraith corner delivery to round off the scoring at -.After the match, hat-trick hero Sean McMahon gave his thoughts on his sidersquos resounding victory.ldquoIt was a good performance, he said. ldquoWe knew they only had  players so we had a good chance of winning but you have to play the  minutes and make sure you get the victory at the end of the day.ldquoWersquove put pressure on the league leaders, itrsquos good to score three goals but the main thing is to get the three points.He added: ldquoI donrsquot usually score headers so thatrsquos my pick of the goals for me.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, B Connolly, R Fitzpatrick, G Carberry, M Rice , B Treacy, C McCartan, S McMahon, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.

However, excellent defence and long clearing kicks meant that the Ballynahinch line was never threatened.The second half was a scrappy affair and Ballynahinch began to fall foul of the referee at the breakdown.UCC kicked a long range penalty to close the gap to six points and missed another moments later as Ballynahinch struggled to put phases together into the wind. However, they sprung to le on  minutes and battled upfield where McCall was denied another maul try for a double movement.Following this disappointment UCC won a big scrum penalty and had the chance to kick to the corner to really turn the screw but misjudged the wind and kicked the ball dead. From the resulting scrum it was the away side who were celebrating as they won a penalty to relieve the pressure and settle the nerves.As the game entered the final quarter it was an error-strewn, stop-start affair, with injury stoppages and errors denying either side the chance to stamp any authority on proceedings.A mistimed Ryan Wilson tackle earned him a yellow card on  minutes and when UCC kicked the resulting penalty to close the gap to three points UCC were probably favourites.However, Ballynahinch produced an excellent spell of forward play with their maul continuing to be a very powerful weapon.They won a penalty from a maul on halfway and went for the corner, using up vital time on the sinbin and subjecting UCC to huge pressure deep in their .A solid scrum allowed Rory Butler the chance to go for the line where UCC gave away a penalty at the breakdown. Ballynahinch piled on the pressure, carrying hard at the line and desperate UCC defence led to another penalty and a yellow card for their replacement prop.The game was now there for the taking and following another big scrum on the UCC line Ballynahinch tried to put Conor Rankin over on the blind side.Multiple phases later UCC looked to have weathered the storm when they stole the ball and kicked clear. A superb chase saw Ballynahinch caught in possession but Cairns made an excellent arcing run to scythe through the cover and head for the line.He was tackled just short but the supporting Hutley was on hand to barge over, taking a knock in the process.He recovered to slot the conversion, sending Ballynahinch  points clear going intothe last five minutes and they saw out the game in relative comfort.Celebrations lasted long into the night and Ballynahinch have now put daylight between themselves and UCC.Third from bottom UCD arrive at Ballymacarn Park on Saturday to take on a rejuvenated local outfit who now have a snf of avoiding the relegation play-off.

One sat down while the other went up to the counter and asked for a bag of coins to be changed.As the men waited in the bank a Securicor delivery van arrived and a guard began leaving money bags into the bank.As the guard left a second bag into the bank one of the robbers produced a handgun and pushed him to the floor while the other vaulted the bank counter and grabbed the bags.Both men then left the bank and raced down the alleyway beside Irwinrsquos Superfoods to the red Sierra which was waiting, with a driver, at the entrance to the supermarket car park.The car sped off and was found on Sunday abandoned in a cul-de-sac off Hillfoot Crescent.CASTLEWELLAN ndash Mill bosses this week denied they plan to close the doors on a Castlewellan factory ndash less than three years after the plant was reopened.Speculation has intensied that Castlewellan Yarns, which is based in the former Moss Lane factory on the townrsquos Dublin road, is to be shut.The company is a ision of Linfield Group of textile-companies but a spokesman when asked about possible closure said this week: ldquoThat is not the situation at the moment. The Castlewellan plant was set up to do a specic job. It is having to compete head-on in a dficult world market at this time of depression.ldquoThere has been short-time working and we have operated at  per cent of capacity. Castlewellan is totally dependent on an upturn in the general linen market.The Linfield Group announced in  that it intended to commence production in Castlewellan. It said then it hoped to create up to  jobs in a poundm investment. However, employment levels have failed to reach this mark and the Ulster linen trade generally is currently experiencing one of it biggest slumps for a number of years.ARDGLASS ndash An assurance has been given that the long-awaited improvement package for Ardglass harbour will go ahead, despite a sizeable increase in cost projections.The chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Authority, Mr Ronan Fitzsimons, has said he is confident the work on the scheme will proceed, even though it is expected to cost substantially more than the Governmentrsquos pound.m budget.Work on the project, which involves extending the main pier by  metres and providing rock armouring at the back of the harbour wall, was expected to begin next month.But trawlermen, who have been campaigning more than  years for the scheme, were startled when it emerged late last week that tenders received were vastly above original estimations.It has been claimed that some of the tenders are up to pound, over the initial budget.Mr Fitzsimons said yesterday there would be a delay in the start date but denied rumours that the scheme is being put on ice indefinitely.ldquoThe start will have to be put back but there is no question of the project being ped, he remarked.STRANGFORD ndash The proposal to build a tidal barrage across Strangford Lough has been killed off ldquoonce and for all.Stormont Minister Richard Needham axed the plan because of the damage such a barrage would have caused to the sensitive environment of Strangford Lough.The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists who described the Ministerrsquos attitude to the Lough as ldquovery positive and encouraging.Mr Needham made his announcement at the annual conference of the Royal Society for the Protection of birds and the Irish Wildbird Conservancy in Newcastle on Saturday.Opening the conference in the Slieve Donard Hotel, Mr Needham said the barrage proposal would no longer be merely shelved but would be dropped completely.ldquoIn the early rsquos there was a proposal to construct a barrage across the Narrows to allow the generation of electricity using tidal power, explained Mr Needham. ldquoAt that time, the proposal was examined from many viewpoints. On economic grounds it just did not measure up, and so it was shelved.ldquoThere is no doubt that the creation of a barrage would severely and irretrievably damaged the superb wildle of the Lough, altering the tidal regime, ruining feeding grounds, and in the process reducing muchthe scenic quality, said the Minister.KILLYLEAGH ndash A government minister is to be asked by Down councillors tomorrow to lt the embargo on marina development at Killyleagh.A deputation of councillors is hoping to persuade Economy Minister, Mr Richard Needham, to allow a marina development on the shores of Strangford Lough.The Minister will be told of the fears that Killyleagh is being turned into a ghost town because of substantial job losses in its industrial base ndash and the belief that a marina could hold out hope of a revival.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor. Mr Sam Osbourne, said ldquowhile we are meeting the Minister about the decision last August to refuse three separate applications for a marina, it goes much wider than that. There is a need for an overall plan for this town.ldquoThe whole place is badly run down and has probably never been at a lower ebb. Killyleagh is a ghost town now. We need some new source of employment and a marina linked to a hotel would be a big boost.DOWNPATRICK ndash Councillors targeting Downpatrickrsquos arts centre for closure may be prevented from carrying out their plans by the terms of the buildingrsquos lease.The -year lease on the building, which was agreed when the council took over the former Town Hall from Lord Dunleath, does not enable the council to sell the property andit is closed for more than  months the building will revert to its original owner.Under the terms agreed, the council took over the building on the basis it would be used solely for the purpose outlined in Article  of the Recreation and Youth Services Order.ldquoThis paragraph specically empowers councils to provide facilities for ldquorecreational, social, physical and cultural activities.The lease on the arts centre states that the owner, Lord Dunleath, would enforce his right to take back the building within  monthsits uses were outside the terms of that clause.This means that several years of council investment, eighteen months worth of running costs, and a pound, grant from the Department of Education would be wasted.DUNDRUM ndash Crisis-threatened Dundrum Regatta has been saved from collapse after villagers rallied to a special meeting last week.The Regatta, one of the oldest summer festivals in Northern Ireland, looked doomed earlier this month but an appeal by organisers has attracted increased community support and ensure the eventrsquos future.The special meeting was called after just five people attended the organising committeersquos annual meeting earlier this month.It was immediately adjourned and an appeal issued to villages to support the reconvened meeting, held in St Donardrsquos hall on Tuesday night.Committee chairman, Mr Paddy Cunningham said: ldquoI was very pleased to see the turnout had increased signicantly and we were able to proceed with the business of organising this yearrsquos Regatta..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Jimmy\u0027s 10k back  ","story":"ONE of the most prestigious races in the local running calendar is ing to the streets of Downpatrick after an absence of three years.Jimmyrsquos K, organised by East Down Athletic Club and supported by MB McGrady  Co, Chartered Accountants, will take place on Sunday, March .Given that it will be the opening race of the  K Grand Prix, and one of the first road running fixtures of the Athletics NI calendar, organisers are expecting a packed entry list.Jimmyrsquos K was last raced in Downpatrick in .

Improved disabled access is also part of the investment plan which will result in a number of paths being widened.Council officials say the planned improvements are essential for local people who are increasingly using the trails as part of their daily routine and commute.Since the start of the Covid pandemic, there has been a major increase in the number of people walking along the banks of the Quoile with this set to increase over the spring and summer.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Gareth Sharvin are delighted with the master plan and the benefit that it will provide for the town, its residents and visitors.Cllr Mason said due to Covid- restrictions, many areas across the district have experienced an increased use of outdoor spaces.ldquoThis has been so important for the health and wellbeing of residents and visitors to our area, she continued.ldquoThe Quoile in particular has been extremely busy with families and friends using the location for running, walking, cycling or simply meeting up with each other. The need for good quality outdoor space has never been as important.Cllr Hanlon said she was ldquoexcited to see the first phase of the local authorityrsquos Covid recovery scheme being rolled out.ldquoI am pleased the work will include enhancing boardwalks and paths at Jane Shore with improved disability access in particular at the gates which will be of particular interest to local anglers who have lobbied for better access, she said.ldquoThis work is vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre.Cllr Sharvin said the joint local authority and government department investment will signicantly improve access along the Janes Shore area and help disabled anglers in particular who have highlighted with him the challenges they face of accessing the walkway.ldquoThe planned improvements will enable everyone to enjoy the uniqueness of the Quoile area as a recreational and tourism asset, he said.Cllr Sharvin said work to resurface the footpath, replace wooden fencing and walking boards, in tandem with the provision of new accessibility gates and cutting back trees and hedging will make a major dference.He said the foliage will be cut back next month and when that is completed, it is hoped that work on the other planned improvements will get underway.The Quoile Angling Club is holding its annual meeting in Murphyrsquos bar, Downpatrick, on March  at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Preservation order put on hold pending planning application  ","story":"A DECISION to make a preservation order to protect trees at the centre of the Exploris Ropebridge car park project in Portaferry has been put on hold.The Department of Infrastructureconfirmed this week that it will wait for the outcome of a planning application before it decides what to do with the trees that local people are campaigning to save.Ards and North Down Borough Council lodged a planning application with its own planning department last December  to gain permission to build an extended car and coach on its own land near the popular visitor venue.The project has been controversial since local conservationists discovered last year that in order to build the car-park, nine mature protected trees would need to be removed.It was later confirmed that the council did not have the authority to remove the trees under a permitted development and needed to apply for planning permission for the car-park which should have been competed by next month.The Portaferry Stop The Trees campaign gathered more than , names in opposition to the trees cull and even offered the council an alternative design which would have saved the trees but resulted in less parking spaces. The design was rejected by the council.The campaign started last May when contractors turned up with equipment and portacabins and marked the trees for felling.Local resident Lily Devlin noticed the development and started the campaign, first rallying support via her Facebook page, and then starting an online petition.Speaking on behalf of the Save the Trees Campaign group, Cathie McKimm said: ldquoThe council got this wrong from the beginning.ldquoWe now have a situation where the council are applying for planning permission for a project they have already appointed contractors for and the project has increased by almost % in cost.ldquoIn bringing in experts to late at a huge cost to the ratepayer to fix the many mistakes theyrsquove made, including failing to include a drainage system in a flood risk area, the council are now having to contribute more than pound, to this scheme and growing, whereas before they were only contributing approximately pound, for the same scheme. ldquoGiven all the conflicts of interest that the council now have we do not believe they can assess this planning application objectively, and believe that the Department of Infrastructure needs to call it in and conduct a full investigation about how this has been handled.A council spokesman confirmed that a planning application for the project would follow regulations which apply to all councils throughout Northern Ireland in making its decision.He said: ldquoThe council will let matters follow due process, mindful of the procedures put in place by the Department for such planning applications.He also confirmed that the project, which was planned as a local tourism boost, had increased in costs.ldquoThe council has applied for and obtained funding of pound, towards the project. At the start of the regeneration scheme, the proposed costs were circa pound,, he said.ldquoHowever, with the passage of time, increased construction costs and refinement of the scheme , the costs were last estimated at circa pound, which was agreed by council in October .A DfI spokesperson confirmed it had initially considered making a preservation order on the trees.He added: ldquoHowever, on January  , the council confirmed that it had instead opted to submit a planning application.

Daffodils are peaking out of the ground, the weather is softening, and the feast of St Brigidrsquos Day , February , has passed.This can mean only one thing ndash lambs! In fact, lambs have been born in our practice since before Christmas. But the majority will be coming to a field near you over the next few weeks.Now, modern flocks have a lot of sheep in them. Indeed, there are about five million sheep in Ireland overall. Thatrsquos one for every man, woman and child.Our domestic sheepis descended from a primitive European ancestor, today found mainly in Corsica. In the past it was common for sheep to havejust one lamb. But today, thanks to better feeding, shelter and shepherding, it is possible for sheep to have twins, triplets and even quads!This abundance can come with problems though. Whata sheep doesnrsquot have enough milk to feed this many lambs  Well, farmers have come up with a number of solutions.The first is lsquopet lambsrsquo. These lambs are hand reared. They are fed with a bottle using condensed milk from commercial suppliers. Or the milk can be taken from another ewe who is producing a lot.As anyone with a baby will tell you, this solution is labour intensive and will keep the shepherd working around the clock. But they are dedicated, and they do it! It is not always sustainable in the long run. Another solution is fostering.Lamb fostering is where a ewe adopts the lamb from another ewe. The reasons for fostering can be manold. A lack of milk is one of the major reasons. The ewe may not want to take on another lamb, not recognising it as her own, but shepherds have adapted one of naturersquos many wonders to encourage it to happen.They use a technique called olfactory imprinting. Have you ever wondered how a ewe can recognise her own lamb in a flock of hundreds  One reason is that, just after birth, the ewe learns the smell of her newborn. This is what olfactory imprinting means.Shepherds can take advantage of this amazing process by rubbing some of the birthing fluid of the newborn lamb into the wool of the lamb to be fostered. The ewe will then accept the lamb as one of her own, and feed and care for it. The lives of many lambs are saved in this way.So when you next look at the fields of Lecale, check out the sheep and seeyou can tell them apart. Evenyou canrsquot, their mums can!.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ulster Aviation Society left ‘dismayed’ over council at Festival of Flight decision  ","story":"THE decision by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to cancel this summerrsquos international Festival of Flight in Newcastle was taken without consulting one of its key partners, it has emerged.Last weekrsquos decision to pull the plug on the event mdash which was last held in  mdash was taken in secret during a meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourist and Regeneration Committee.It is understood that no contact was made with the Ulster Aviation Society which has played a major role since the inaugural festival and described its disappointment at the cancellation decision.Regularly attracting in the region of , people to the resort in the summer, the flagship tourist event has been a major success for over a decade.Council officials say that due to the challenges in planning such a major festival, securing commitments from participants and with the uncertainty caused to date by the pandemic, organising this yearrsquos event would not be possible.Some councillors believe that given the local authorityrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades in Downpatrick and Newry are set to go ahead next month and with the further easing of Covid regulations, some form of airshow could have been organised for Newcastle this summer.This week, Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis urging the council to confirm that next yearrsquos festival will go ahead.The Ulster Aviation Society said it was ldquodisappointed and dismayed about the cancellation of the airshow and the fact that the organisation had not been consulted.Society chairman Ray Burrows said it was ldquoastonishing that the event had been ldquoshot down in secret, with no reasonable explanation.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has urged the local council to ldquograsp the opportunity and organise an alternative event, suggesting a large scale festival that incorporates and builds on the most popular elements of the Festival of Flight.He is keen to see an event showcasing the regionrsquos ldquooutstanding food and drink offering with Newcastle a designated venue for arts, culture and music events to create opportunities showcasing the entrepreneurial spirit and pioneering innovation of the district.Mr Burrows said while these were ldquoall excellent suggestions, he said as elements in addition to, or within, the Festival of Flight, surely not as a replacement for it.He continued: ldquoThat said, we would be pleased indeed to meet with the council or the mayor to discuss the matter. We want to help Newcastle demonstrate in a powerful, popular way how important our aviation future and heritage are to Northern Ireland.ldquoThatrsquos exactly what did in recent years, before Covid.ldquoWe [the UAS] had probably the most popular exhibition within the ground-based event and thousands of parents have brought their children for photographs in our Spitfire and our Alouette helicopter, at no charge.Mr Burrows suggested that unless the councilrsquos decision is reversed, or at least re-assessed, he expects there will be tremendous disappointment from the public.The international festival was cancelled in  because of bad weather and in  and last year because of the Covid- pandemic it was also grounded.Urging the local authority to confirm that it will be chocks away for next summerrsquos Festival of Flight, Cllr Lewis said that for the past two years, the organisation has been unable to deliver a tourism events programme due to the impact of Covid-.ldquoAlthough the possible impact of future Covid iants is dficult to predict, it is hoped that larger scale events can resume this summer. This will be a welcome boost to residents and the local trade and hospitality sectors, he continued.ldquoCouncil research indicates that almost poundm was generated in  for the district as a direct result of tourism events. Therefore, it is bitterly disappointing that this yearrsquos Festival of Flight will not be going ahead.Cllr Lewis said the income that it would have generated would be a welcome boost to traders in the town and benefit the collective tourism industry across South Down.He continued: ldquoWe must not underestimate the huge draw of this annual festival. I note that council officers have said that throughout this past  months they had continued to engage with key stakeholders including the RAF.ldquoIt was advised that due to challenges planning the festival, securing air assets and the uncertainty of the pandemic that it has not been possible to host the festival of flight this year.Cllr Lewis revealed that he has been contacted by many aviation enthusiasts who are bitterly disappointed that the festival wonrsquot go ahead.He added: ldquoI fail to see how the event couldnrsquot have at least been planned for later in the year, now that we know the majority of restrictions are to be lted.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The NASA joint effort with the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency sets out its aim as being to explore every phase of cosmic history.Marina Koren, a staff writer with The Atlantic, has commented that “the project, at its core, represents some of our purest intentions in space exploration”, adding: “Scientists want to understand the arc of our strange universe, how it led to a story of le on Earth, and whether that narrative has unfolded anywhere .”I have never seen science and religion as in competition with each other. A churchman for whom I have especially high regard is the Church of England’s late Archbishop of York, John Habgood, who died in  and who had an earlier background in science.Having studied natural sciences at King’s College, Cambridge, he obtained a double first and went on to hold a scientic post at the university while carrying out research in physiology.He had not been particularly interested in religion until he came in touch with the Christian Union at Cambridge University.Dr Habgood chaired meetings that I used to attend in England and he struck me as not only an intellectual giant but also as an unfailingly courteous and strikingly calm and quiet man. His  book, Making Sense, considered the issue of the Bible and scientic discovery, including the question of creation.Dr Habgood held that God works through natural laws, writing: “The biblical story sets out the inner meaning of the scientic story by revealing the dependence of all existence on God, and the ultimate meaning of it as finding its fulfilment in God.”Science is about establishing facts and applying that knowledge while religion is about the practice of faith and the interpretation of facts in light of that faith.Science and religion are therefore dferent and while there are facts that are part of religious history and religious testimony, faith is essentially what comes beyond facts.Religious people ‘know’ of God by conviction rather than as the result of scientic analysis.What has been termed ‘metaphysics’ is a branch of philosophy which attempts to understand reality itself. The term literally means ‘beyond physics’.No doubt the James Webb space telescope will help our understanding of how things have come to be as they are, but it will not inform us further about whether or not God exists or about the nature and being of God.It will not be able to tell us that, no, God does not exist, and nor will it be able to tell us that God has been scientically discovered.The existence of God and questions about God’s nature are ultimately matters of faith.Atheists raise many dferent objections to religious faith but they are unable to refute it absolutely They can point to contradictions in religious world-views, they can present a reasonable alternative, they can even ridicule faith, but they cannot show that faith is unarguably mistaken.Nonetheless, apart from revelation itself, there have been ious philosophical arguments in favour of God’s existence, one of which has been the argument from design.Basically, this suggests that the world we know is so marvellously complex that it is wholly implausible to assert that we could be here simply by chance, or that the universe with all its laws of nature just happened to come into being because of a massive explosion, the cause of which is unknown.This is classically illustrated in what is known as the watchmaker analogy.William Paley, in an  book on natural theology, wrote thatone stumbled upon a pocket watch lying on a heath it would be reasonable to deduce that someone had either dropped it there or had left it in that place for some unknown reason, and that it had been made by at least one watchmaker rather than having come about by natural forces.In Northern Ireland, the magnicent Giant’s Causeway is an illustration of a remarkable stone formation as a result of natural forces, butit were a huge timepiece such a conclusion would certainly be a stretch too far.While a Big Bang cause of the universe coming into its present state is generally asserted, it is still quite possible that such an explosion may have itself been designed as part of a ine, creative plan.It all depends on what one believes.Canon Ian Ellis is a former editor of The Church of Ireland GazetteMore letters and opinion:Click here – Ruth Dudley Edwards: Christopher Stalford showed us that kindness mattersClick here – Before talk of hourly train service to Dublin, Irish Rail service needs improved Click here – Even the mildest Russian territorial goal now is totally unacceptable——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: WSPThe first option would see a segregated cycle and pedestrian path through an old railway line, from Cosmeston Drive in Sully to Railway Walk in Penarth. This would involve clearing out a lot of overgrown vegetation on the railway line, and could be an expensive option.The second option would see the existing pavement on Lavernock Road widened, for shared use between pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit would be reduced from mph to mph along this part of Lavernock Road. This option would be the cheapest.The third option would combine parts of the first two. It would use the old railway line halfway, from Cosmeston Drive to St Mary’s Well Bay Road, before then crossing Lavernock Road and continuing on the pavement until Sully.The consultation website said: “There is a growing need to reform the way people travel between destinations using private vehicles. Providing good quality active travel infrastructure is an important component in negating the need for people to own vehicles.“Active travel infrastructure may also be used as a tool to improve physical and mental well being and mitigate the impact of private vehicles on the environment.“By providing one of these proposed route options, we can facilitate a modal sht from the private car to active modes for short distances to either Sully, Cosmeston and Penarth.”.removePeople interested in responding to the consultation have until March  to do so, by visiting the website: sullyactivetravelmonplace.is Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityA dog is seen by many as another member of the family but it’s important to remember they do require a dferent diet to humans and some ingredients in pancakes could lead to tummy troubles of even health problems like diabetes.Not wanting pups to miss out, Ocado have partnered with an expert in pet nutrition to create a recipe which is safe for dogs – even those with particularly sensitive tums.Stephen Ward is the Founder of Heights Farm Premium Pet Foods – a high-quality, independent pet food manufacturer designed for animals with allergies and intolerances. Stephen is passionate about pet nutritionHe said: “Traditional syrup-filled human pancakes would not be suitable for dogs as they contain salts, sugars and carbohydrates.“A dog can’t break down the fats and carbs like a human does. If eaten regularly, the result would generally be rapid weight gain which of course can lead to chronic conditions such as diabetes.“Also, more immediate issues may be seen in dogs with allergies, intolerances and particularly sensitive stomachs.”When is Pancake day This year pancake day falls on March . Otherwise known as Shrove Tuesday, it is the day before the start of Lent fasting practiced by Christians in the run up to the Easter festival.Pancakes are supposed to use up things like eggs, milk and sugar before the fasting begins.Dog-friendly pancake recipeStephen has designed a recipe especially for dogs to enjoy this Pancake Day, replacing common allergens like wheat flour and cow’s milk with dog-appropriate alternatives.The recipe can be found on the Ocado website, where you can also purchase the necessary ingredients.Ingredients:Step Sieve the flour into a mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of the flour and add the egg and ml of lukewarm water before whisking until the ingredients are fully combined.Step Heat a non-stick frying pan to a medium temperature then add a ladle of the pancake mixture to the pan.Step Cook the pancakes for  seconds on each side before removing from the heat and leaving to cool fully. Add your dog’s favourite toppings and serve.Tips for a healthy pancake day with your dogIf you’re going to celebrate Pancake Day with your dog, Stephen has three more top tips to ensure you’re prioritising your dog’s health:As always, make sure your dog has access to plenty of fresh clean drinking water.Adjust your dog’s daily feeds to account for the extra calorie intake.As with all treats, remember to serve these pancakes in moderation. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_beebfdadfde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fabeecaaabdcc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.
