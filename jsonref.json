Experts think so. Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that.’When she was just eight, Sky was the youngest competitor in the Vans U.S. Open, and placed higher on the leaderboard than women 20 years her senior. This year, she won gold at Simple Session, a women’s contest in Estonia. The course had been designed for men twice her size.         Skateboard GB chair Lucy Adams describes her as ‘absolutely phenomenal’, pointing out that she can pull off moves such as a 720, which involves two full mid-air rotations. ‘There are only a handful of girls in the world doing that\u0027Today’s venue — a skate park in Salford, Greater Manchester — is pretty much Sky’s UK ‘home’. She certainly seems at ease here.One minute we are standing together at the edge of an 8ft drop, talking about her favourite pop stars, the next she has tipped her board off the side and disappeared. No helmet. No knee pads. Argh!‘This is the thing we have most arguments about,’ says her dad. ‘She hates the pads, so we don’t make her wear them for bowls this size — but we do for bigger ones, and when she’s on concrete. We’ve said that if she breaks a bone, we may reconsider.’Off she goes, arms out, body bending, sun-bleached hair billowing behind. She swooshes up the other side of the bowl, coming right over the edge, and flips her body upside down. Afterwards, she’s grinning ear to ear.What does it feel like? ‘Like I’m flying,’ she says. ‘The minute I stop, I want to do it again, but higher.’         Her father Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And anotherDo skateboarding prodigies exist? Well, Sky did develop the skills early. Perhaps some of it was in the genes.Before she was born, her father was a passionate and committed surfer. He admits that when his Japanese wife Meiko gave birth to Sky, he thought those days were over.‘My attitude to risk changed when I became a dad,’ he says. ‘It seems weird now, given how things have turned out, but when I knew I was having a girl, I thought she’d want to do things with her mum. I never imagined she would be into the same things as I was.‘She’s taught me a lot about gender equality — about everything.’ He had a tiny tornado on his hands. When he tried to wrap her in cotton wool, she broke through.‘She was fearless. She’d say: “Higher, Daddy, again.” Sky could surf pretty much before she could walk. She still surfs every morning.’The fact that their house is on the beach helps. ‘School starts at 7.30am so I have to get up at 5,’ Sky says. ‘Ocean and I run down the beach. When Dad tells us it’s time to get ready for school, we say: “Just one more wave!” ’They surf on their own? Stu nods. ‘They know what they’re doing. It’s natural for them.’There are shared skills between surfing and skateboarding, and they’ll both be making their Olympic debuts at the Tokyo games. And guess what? Sky hopes to qualify for the GB surfing team, too. ‘Two medals would be good,’ she admits. ‘I’d like to win, yes, but even if I don’t, it doesn’t matter. I just do it because it’s fun.’ Is she ever afraid? ‘Yes, but I want to beat it,’ she says. ‘And if you fall, you just get up again.’And it’s not just sport. She will try anything, especially if there is a competition involved. ‘She and her brother will see who can eat the spiciest chilli,’ says Stu.What’s the most adventurous thing she has eaten? ‘Tarantula,’ Sky says. ‘We were in Cambodia and they have restaurants that serve crickets and all sorts of insects — and tarantula. Someone said: “Would you like to try it?” and I said: “Why not?” ’Stu claims to be a social media novice, and was astonished when the first YouTube video he posted of Sky in action got tens of thousands of hits. Another followed. And another.The family were asked to get involved with skateboarding charities. Sky developed a taste for mentoring, it seems, and was happy to try her hand at being a feminist icon, too.‘Why should the boys have all the fun? I’ve been to Cambodia to teach children who have never skateboarded before. It was amazing. I said to the girls: “Just try it. You can do it.” ’ When she first pitched up at contests, she admits the men raised their eyebrows. ‘Then they started crowding round to watch and I was like: “Yeeeeesss!” I want to show them that girls can do anything boys can do.’In the space of just a few short years she has amassed an extraordinary fan base. She was seven when she got her first sponsorship deal, but the big sporting juggernauts have started to take note. She recently signed a deal with Nike, which meant her image was emblazoned on posters all over the U.S.All the attention has thrilled and alarmed her parents in equal measure.‘We are nervous about putting too much pressure on her, and it becoming more than just fun for her,’ admits Stu. He isn’t specific about how much money she has made, but it sounds as if her parents are determined that she is sensible about it.‘She self-funds a lot of the charity projects, so she will put money into that, with flights for instance,’ Stu adds. ‘And her merchandising goes 100 per cent to charity. After that, well, money has been put away so that it will help her in the future.’They certainly don’t seem to be limelight seekers. Stu declines to be in our photographs, ‘because this isn’t about me’.Nor is his wife mad keen on the attention. ‘We live in a small village in Japan, and we want to keep it low-key.’That may prove tricky. Last year, Sky won the junior version of the U.S. programme Dancing With The Stars, despite the fact she’d never had a dance class in her life.Stu says that the family were reeling when Sky got the offer, yet Sky insisted she wanted to do it. Why? ‘Because it sounded fun,’ she says.She couldn’t dance but threw herself into training, adapting her somersaults to moves she could do in a sequinned ballgown.While her mum and dad had moved to California for the filming of the show, they hesitated over allowing her to be too much of a media darling. Offers to appear on big chat shows such as Ellen were politely declined.And Sky’s parents were nervous when the idea of her aiming for the Olympics was mooted.‘I didn’t think it was a good idea, because I didn’t want to put too much pressure on her, but Sky said she wanted to do it,’ says Stu.The family set-up is quite unique, but, as a blueprint for creating a future Olympian, it has its merits.The Brown family have a Californian beach vibe going on, but also a rigid Japanese work ethic. ‘Her school is quite strict. They don’t mind her being off if we have to be travelling, but she has to do her homework. That idea of hard work is important.’Sky’s first language is Japanese, but she is also fluent in English, helped by her time in the U.S. She’s very much a global citizen, though. She’s travelled all over the world on sporting and charitable adventures. She has released her own skateboard, with proceeds going to charity, and has so far raised £13,000.Some of her mentoring has happened closer to home. Little Ocean is his sister’s double. They are inseparable and share everything, even a bed.‘He’s my bestie,’ she says, as he joins her on his skateboard, trying to match her every leap.When he takes a tumble — doubtless acquiring another bruise — she pulls him up.‘Let’s go again,’ she says, and they do. Sky Brown (@skybrown) • Instagram photos and videos"},{"url":null,"title":"Adam Schiff rejects reports Mueller indictments over","story":"Share this articlePoliticusUSA on Twitter: \u0026quotSen.

The storm has killed hundreds of people and affected more than 2.6 million others with catastrophic damage occurring in and around Beira in southern Mozambique. Was Cyclone Idai caused by climate change?It’s impossible to say if the storm itself was caused by climate change but experts believe its impact was made worse by the gradual rise in temperature.How did climate change make it worse?Experts point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a year’s worth of rain in just a few days - more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, increasing the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges are much more powerful, increasing the risk of the sort of inland flooding seen in the port city of Beira. Sea levels are about a foot higher than a century ago fed by melting ice at the poles.What do the experts say?“Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns,” said Mami Mizutori, the UN’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction.What does the future look like for the region?Rebuilding with climate change in mind will be essential. This was not done after the last major cyclone 19 years ago. Roads, housing, utilities should all be built with future storms and flooding in mind.Sounds expensive, can this be done?Ironically, climate change makes future-proofing more difficult as the region’s economy, and therefore its capacity to rebuild, has already been depleted by rising temperatures, drought etc.At the Paris climate summit in 2015, then-prime minister of Mozambique, Carlos Agostinho do Rosario, said: “These weather phenomena affect the government’s efforts to meet national priorities, especially food security, that are critical to poverty reduction.”Secretary General of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), Elhadj As Sy talks with a survivor of Cyclone Idai, at an evacuation centre in Beira, MozambiqueYes, developed nations, including the UK, are scrambling to send aid and disaster relief teams to the area.The rich nations also pledged in Paris 2015 to ramp up aid to $100 billion per year in restorative climate funding to poorer nations by 2020. This is because industrialisation in the west caused most of the current rise in global temperatures. But so far less than 10 per cent of this funding has been secured.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyPhilip Hammond says second Brexit referendum \u0026#39deserves to be considered\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Matteo Salvini hopes to end 25 years of centre-Left rule with elections in southern region of BasilicataComment: So much for ‘taking back control of our borders’ – most immigrants come from outside the EUIsil\u0026#39s caliphate may be defeated but cells\u0026#39 guerrilla tactics point to new deadly threatComment: We need a new leader who will believe in the UK - not embarrass itCabinet told to out Theresa May in order to rescue BrexitPrivate, Hollywood or NHS delivery: what birth plan will Meghan go for?Littering cyclists and joggers could be to blame for countryside rubbish problemComment: If we really want to save water, we need to introduce some market competitionComment: Theresa May’s issues with trust are key to her rise - and her fall Comment: The death of Isil\u0026#39s dream marks the end of my waking nightmareComment: Hurrah, we’re beating France in the league of happinessNew Kensington prep school will offer weekly museum trips, a philosophy club and an \u0026#39innovation lab\u0026#39Viking Sky: Passengers airlifted to safety after cruise ship breaks down off Norwegian coastHunt in your gardens for slugs, RHS urges, amid worries beneficial British slug is being wiped out Comment: We\u0026#39re supposed to be a Christian country – but try telling that to the keepers of our public orderUniversities who continue to give out too many top grades face £500,000 fines, Education Secretary warnsUniversities could be stripped of their powers to award degrees Theresa May warned her Government’s failure to introduce hundreds of policies will harm the Conservative’s chances at the next General Election We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cyclone idai happens next","story":"A major humanitarian crisis has unfolded in the wake of Cyclone Idai, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

His daughter, played by Caroline Sheen, arrives from England to help out.Both the writers and the director are English, and the supporting cast of Welsh actors are not native to North Wales.The comedy drama begins on Monday as part of BBC One’s new daytime schedule, but was shown in a primetime slot on BBC Wales last month.The verdict was damning, with many viewers complaining that the Welsh characters have accents from South Wales.The leader of Cardiff Council, Huw Thomas, called it “one of the most unfunny, least culturally nuanced TV programmes ever commissioned”.Plaid Cymru’s shadow minister for international affairs and culture Delyth Jewell, said the series is “catastrophic” and set in a version of Anglesey “where the inhabitants for some unfathomable reason seem to have developed Valleys accents”.In an article criticising the series, she claimed that Wales is treated as the poor relation by the BBC, while the corporation has just launched a dedicated channel for Scotland.Ms Jewell wrote: “As licence fee payers in Scotland are treated to a new nine o’clock news programme committed to ‘showing the world through Scottish eyes’ on their new channel, Wales is treated to a sub-standard ‘comedy’ showing Wales through English eyes, inaccurate preconceptions about accents included.“This form of cultural colonialism does a great disservice to Wales. Not only do licence fee payers have to suffer appalling TV that bears no relation to their lived experience, but our incredibly rich pool of creative talent is being shunned.”The drama reduces Wales to “nothing but a lovely background for someone else’s story. No self-respecting nation should be satisfied in playing a bit-part like this,” she added.“Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with a good English drama, but in this case we were promised a much needed English-language drama that pertained to the lives of people living in Wales.”The drama reunited Lamb with Melanie Walters, his co-star from the hit BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey, and also features Hayley Mills.Lamb, 71, said during filming for the production: It\u0027s a family comedy drama - but it\u0027s about as far removed from Gavin and Stacey as you can imagine.Gavin and Stacey was set in the far suburbs of London - it was just filmed in Wales in Barry - while Pitching In is all about life on a leisure park in Anglesey.Nick Andrews, head of commissioning for BBC Wales, said: “Pitching In is a comedy drama about family, friendship and community, which will showcase the beauty of North Wales.”This is not the first time a drama has been criticised for failing to accurately represent Welsh people.Netflix series Sex Education came under fire earlier this year for its Americanised characters, despite the show being filmed in South Wales.One bemused social media user commented: I’m very confused by this Sex Education show on Netflix.

Among those airlifted were believed to many British tourists. The airlift was continuing in the early morning, Fjeld said.Nearly 338 of the 1,373 onboard were evacuated by helicopter by early Sunday morning. They were flown to a village just north of the town of Molde, on Norway\u0027s west coast.According to the latest figures from the rescue services, 17 people had been taken to hospital with injuries.Earlier on Saturday lifeboats were forced to turn back en route to the ship due to the brutal conditions.Later, reports emerged that a cargo ship with nine crew members was in trouble nearby, and the local Norwegian rescue service erted two of the helicopters to that rescue.Two hundred Britons were believed to be among those on board the Viking Sky ship with Norwegian media suggesting the majority of  passengers were British and American tourists. Derek and Esther Browne, from Hampshire, said the whole boat was swaying, it was very rough before they were airlifted to safety.Mr Browne told BBC Radio 5 Live\u0027s Stephen Nolan: We had a few people on stretchers, several with cuts, two with broken limbs, but fortunately we were alright. We were airlifted onto the helicopter which was quite a frightening experience.He added: I\u0027d never been in a helicopter before, there were a lot of high winds, hovering overhead and the winchman came down and we were then collected up and so I shut my eyes as we arrived into the helicopter and there were 15 of us for about a 20-minute ride.Norway cruise rescue, in picturesThe stretch of water known as Hustadvika is known for its fierce weather and the shallow waters are dotted with reefs. The Norwegian government is currently deciding whether to build a giant ocean tunnel through a nearby mountain to improve safety.The Viking Sky, built in 2017, belongs to Viking Ocean Cruises, part of the Viking Cruises group founded by Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen.Several vessels and four helicopters took part in the rescue and extensive facilities were set up on land to receive passengers.All search and rescue teams in the region were mobilised, including 60 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross, a spokesman said.Passengers on board the Viking Sky, waiting to be evacuated, off the coast of Norway on SaturdayThe ship, built in 2017, belongs to Viking Ocean Cruises, part of the Viking Cruises group founded by Norwegian billionaire Torstein Hagen. According to the company website, its passenger capacity is 930.Several vessels and four helicopters took part in the rescue and facilities to receive passengers have been set up on land, the rescue service said.Wind was blowing at a speed of 38 knots, police told Norwegian newspaper VG.All search and rescue teams in the region are mobilising, including 60 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross, a spokesman said.Viking\u0027s operational headquarters, located in Basel, Switzerland, did not respond when contacted by telephone.As the phone batteries of passengers dwindled and died, and some on board were injured and taken to hospital, the relatives anxiously waited for news.Many used Twitter in the hope of contacting missing loved ones.While some remained missing:   Others were found safe and sound, and were enjoying free wine and food in a local hotel as they made plans to return home after the ordeal:There were complaints about lack of information from the cruise operator, as family members of passengers complained that they were not told about the injury status of their loved ones:Pictures posted to social media show the chaotic sleeping arrangements as passengers curled up in life jackets to try to get some sleep as they waited to be airlifted to safety.Destruction on the ship was also plain to see, with broken glass on the floor and doors torn off their hinges.Philip Hammond says second Brexit referendum \u0026#39deserves to be considered\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Matteo Salvini hopes to end 25 years of centre-Left rule with elections in southern region of BasilicataComment: So much for ‘taking back control of our borders’ – most immigrants come from outside the EUIsil\u0026#39s caliphate may be defeated but cells\u0026#39 guerrilla tactics point to new deadly threatComment: We need a new leader who will believe in the UK - not embarrass itCabinet told to out Theresa May in order to rescue BrexitPrivate, Hollywood or NHS delivery: what birth plan will Meghan go for?Comment: If we really want to save water, we need to introduce some market competitionLittering cyclists and joggers could be to blame for countryside rubbish problemComment: Theresa May’s issues with trust are key to her rise - and her fall Comment: Hurrah, we’re beating France in the league of happinessNew Kensington prep school will offer weekly museum trips, a philosophy club and an \u0026#39innovation lab\u0026#39Comment: The death of Isil\u0026#39s dream marks the end of my waking nightmareHunt in your gardens for slugs, RHS urges, amid worries beneficial British slug is being wiped out Universities who continue to give out too many top grades face £500,000 fines, Education Secretary warnsComment: We\u0026#39re supposed to be a Christian country – but try telling that to the keepers of our public orderUniversities could be stripped of their powers to award degrees Theresa May warned her Government’s failure to introduce hundreds of policies will harm the Conservative’s chances at the next General Election Former MI5 chief warns police and intelligence officers could blame AI for controversial or racist decisionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hunt gardens slugs rhs urges amid worries beneficial british","story":"Gardeners have been urged to pick up their torches and hunt in their gardens for slugs as the Royal Horticultural Society issues a plea for data on the disappearing British bug.There are worries the Yellow Cellar Slug, which is useful for gardens as it feeds on decaying rather than live plant material, is being usurped by the Green Cellar Slug, originally from Ukraine,  which arrived in the 1970s. Since the Green Cellar Slug arrived, numbers of the useful slug are thought to have sharply declined.While both slugs have large, green-yellow, patterned bodies, the Yellow Cellar Slug has a long yellow stripe running along the centre of its tail.As slugs are nocturnal, people are being asked to don torches and step out into their gardens after dark in the hope of recording them.The RHS has asked those with gardens to take photographs showing the top view of each slug, match the slug to the ID guide on the RHS website to see what species it is, keep a note of how long the search took and how many slugs were found, note which plant, if any, the slugs were found on, and to record findings on the RHS’ iRecord pageImogen Cavadino, Research Assistant at the Royal Horticultural Society, said: “Of the 44 species of slug known to exist in the UK only nine are serious pests.Most are important composters and feed on fungi, lichens and algae. Slugs are also a valuable part of the garden ecosystem because they serve as an important food source for birds, hedgehogs and other garden visitors. Both cellar slugs feed on detritus, moulds and algae, though they are known to feed on pet food and even old damp wallpaper.They are more like the cleaners of the garden and great for the compost heap. There is even a man in Australia who keeps the Yellow Cellar Slugs in his bathroom to feed onclean the mould from the grout between his bathroom tiles and his shower curtain.Yellow Cellar Slugs are found on all continents except Antarctica, though some of these populations may actually be the Green Cellar Slug as the two are so often confused.Please review our commenting policyPhilip Hammond says second Brexit referendum \u0026#39deserves to be considered\u0026#39Italy\u0026#39s Matteo Salvini hopes to end 25 years of centre-Left rule with elections in southern region of BasilicataComment: So much for ‘taking back control of our borders’ – most immigrants come from outside the EUIsil\u0026#39s caliphate may be defeated but cells\u0026#39 guerrilla tactics point to new deadly threatComment: We need a new leader who will believe in the UK -

Although at first some found them strange-looking or were convinced they would fall out of their ears, they quickly became the in-ear wireless headphone to aspire to.Rarely in the two years and three months since launch has demand eased off. As a result, the look has gone from curious to acceptable to – dare I say it\u0026nbsp– iconic. And certainly ubiquitous.Now, the second-generation AirPods have been announced, I talked to Greg Joswiak, Apple’s Vice President of Product Marketing and Kate Bergeron, Vice President of Hardware Engineering about the new arrivals.The new AirPods look, at first glance, like the older model, even down to the price, which remains the same at £159. There is no difference in the look or shape of the buds themselves and there is only one visible change to the case: a Wireless Charging Case is now available\u0026nbspfor an extra £40, allowing you to place the case on a compatible wireless charging pad instead of plugging it in with a Lightning cable.This means there’s a tiny LED on the outside of the case to show when it’s charging.\u0026nbspThe new\u0026nbspAirPods\u0026nbspare on sale online now and will be in Apple Stores next week.Created with Sketch.Apple unveils the iPhone X Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, shows Animoji during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, speaks during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing, Phil Schiller, introduces the iPhone x during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone X during a launch event in Cupertino, California, U.S. September 12, 2017So far, so good.“The bigger picture, though, is that AirPods simply deliver a magical wireless experience.”I’m not sure I like using the word magical, but I see what he’s saying. Pairing AirPods with an iPhone is exceptionally simple. As Joswiak explains, “As soon as you’ve pulled the AirPods out of the box and flipped open the lid on the case, there’s a simple one-tap set-up, they’re automatically paired and connected. Once you’ve done that, they’re immediately set up to work with all your Apple devices, including an Apple Watch, iPad or Mac that uses the same Apple ID. Once you’ve used AirPods, you never go back. They’re the most popular wireless headphones in the world. They’ve become a cultural phenomenon. For us, they’re the key ingredient to the wireless future. We designed them to be effortless to use.”Open the case near an iPhone and a screen will pop up showing the exact battery life. And there are other cool features, like the way when you’re talking to someone, and you naturally take one of the AirPods out your ear to do so, the music pauses, resuming when you put the bud back into your ear.All these features remain the same in the new version. By the way, you can use AirPods with Android phones, for instance, but the pairing is not as seamless.Kate Bergeron explains the new headphones in more detail:\u0026nbsp“When we were thinking about generation two, we really wanted to focus on this new H1 chip that was designed specifically for headphones. We’re combining wireless technology which is a hallmark of Apple’s and very highly customised audio. Together, these things create an amazing audio experience. Because the H1 chip is more powerful, it delivers some profound efficiencies, which means you can have Siri available all the time.”Ah, yes, I forgot to say, another AirPods feature is the way you can tap on either of the buds while they are in your ear and then ask Siri, Apple’s virtual personal assistant, to change the track, lift the volume or even give you spoken directions to wherever you’re going.AirPods 2 on Wednesday, 20 March (Apple)Now, with the new AirPods, you don’t need to tap. Just say, “Hey, Siri” and it will respond. This is made possible thanks to the H1 chip saving so much battery life that it can be listening for the magic wake words at all times.“So, we’re able to have \u0027Hey, Siri\u0027 listening enabled at all times and still keep the same battery life as before: five hours’ listening time is still achieved thanks to this new chip,” Bergeron says.“In addition, we’ve been able to deliver 50 per cent more talk time so when you’re on a call, you’ll have three hours of battery life, not two.”Leaving aside whether jabbering on for three hours is really desirable, this is quite a feat. So, how come more talk time but no extra battery life? That’s because when you’re talking, listening out for “Hey, Siri” is turned off.Switching between devices is up to twice as fast, now, too. “If you’re using your AirPods between your Mac, your iPhone and your iPad, switching is even more seamless and the connection to phone calls, when you’re pulling your AirPods out of your pocket to connect to a phone call, is up to 50 per cent faster than before,” Bergeron says. “In addition, for some casual gaming on your iPhone, for instance, we’re able to provide up to 30 per cent lower latency.”My experience of Apple’s stats in situations like this is that the figures don’t mean that much but the experience when you use them is noticeably different.Apple leak reveals bizarre new feature for 2019 iPhoneApple unveils brand new iPads in surprise announcementThe improved chip means improved audio in different ways, too. “The combination of the wireless changes we’ve made in the chip as well as the audio gives a more robust wireless connection, which turns into better audio quality in different conditions. When going outside, some people have found that in that environment there can be problems maintaining RF (radio frequency) links. Now, in all sorts of different conditions we find we’re able to have better audio quality all the time.”The LED on the new wireless charging case is the main visible difference compared to the previous case. “The cases are exactly the same size, there’s a slight increase in weight thanks to adding the wireless charging coil but it’s negligible.”Wireless charging is traditionally slower than through a Lightning cable. “It’s just over two hours to charge the case from zero to 100 per cent via Lightning,” Joswiak chips in, “and around three-and-a-half hours wirelessly. But realistically, customers rarely charge from zero, and the fast charge is the same as before – just put the AirPods themselves into the charging case for 15 minutes and you get three hours of listening time.”Apple is expected to release a new version of iOS, the operating software for iPhones and iPads, soon. I wonder if the new hands-free Siri feature will have to wait for that, but Joswiak’s reply is elegant rather than factually revealing: “We always recommend that for every new product that customers install the latest version of software that’s available at that time.”Reading the runes, I would imagine it means that by the time the new AirPods reach customers next week, that enhanced software will be available to make hands-free Siri work.The new AirPods are a big event because almost no product attracts the level of interest of these little in-ear wireless headphones.\u0026nbsp Next week, if they live up to Apple’s promises, they’ll be even more desirable.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was on the side of the angels with the second of those, and stands a better chance of winning the next fight\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentHyundai\u0027s patriach Chung Moon-Koo. The family Chung family is locked in a battle with Elliott over HyundaiHyundai Motor was celebrating victory this morning. Its investors rejected a demand for the appointment of several new directors and a huge special idend, tabled by the activist investor, Elliott Advisers, which has become a major thorn in the side of the South Korean conglomerate.\u0026nbspPaul Singer’s outfit may have pushed too hard when it came to the size of the Won7tn (£4.7bn) idend it wanted. Hyundai has vast reserves of cash, but its profits have been in decline and the global outlook is cloudy for the motor industry. Given the latter, it’s perhaps understandable that investors baulked and opted for the company’s offer, even though it is worth less than a sixth of what Elliott was proposing.It was on far firmer ground with its demand for a shake up in the boardroom to foster improved governance and greater accountability at the firm, one of the country’s famed family controlled Chaebol that have long dominated the South Asian nation’s vibrant economy. They have been facing criticism on a number of fronts, including the charge of taking minority investors for granted.\u0026nbspHyundai creates app to unlock and control vehicles with mobile phoneHyundai unveils walking car to help save livesHyundai to introduce new electric cars for 2022While this battle may have been lost Elliott’s war is far from over.\u0026nbspIt won a dust up\u0026nbspover a proposed\u0026nbspownership restructuring last year, which critics held was designed solely to benefit the Chung family, and cement its control.The next one will come when a revised plan is submitted later this year. Hyundai only needed the support of 50 per cent of its investors to knock Elliott back over the idend and board seats, and it was assisted by investors such as South Korea’s National Pension Service, the second biggest shareholder, falling in behind the Chung family.\u0026nbspA revised restructuring plan could require up to two thirds support to pass. Elliott should find that easier to win if it objects by aligning with other overseas investors. They hold about half the company.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

They can be of benefit to lumbering,\u0026nbspunderperforming companies with moribund boards that get stuck in the mud and are in need of a good jolt. But they can also cause a great deal of damage in their desire for a quick buck, leaving scorched husks behind them and longer term investors scratching their heads and wondering how it happened.\u0026nbspHowever, while its demand for a huge payout from Hyundai is debatable, Elliott’s call for improved governance sees it on the side of the angels. It\u0027s a sad fact that good corporate governance is an under rated virtue\u0026nbspand it sometimes seems to require the movement of financial mountains to achieve it.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene.

Are you kidding me? Give me a break! Everyone, including Facebook, have tech debt and security debt that piles up. But that\u0027s not an excuse any longer, Sam Curry, chief security officer at security firm Cybereason, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Facebook is starting to look like critical social infrastructure, where there responsibility is to the public. It\u0027s past time to go back and clean the skeletons out of the closets. How can we trust this platform to get bigger and get more connected under the hood if they can\u0027t do the basis blocking and tackling right? Facebook needs a security strategy for the 21st century not the 20th century.

Their deaths on Pakistan’s ‘Killer Mountain’\u0026nbspleave a sport reckoning with its own burgeoning popularity, writes Adam WithnallClick to followThe IndependentThe bodies of British climber Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi were found after a two-week searchTom Ballard will never climb Everest. Before his death on Pakistan’s Nanga Parbat was confirmed earlier this month, the prodigious British mountaineer would joke that he had been scaling peaks since before he was born –\u0026nbspin a way, it was what he was born to do.\u0026nbspAged just 30, Ballard already had some extraordinary feats on his climbing resume, foremost among them his record for scaling all six of Europe’s most challenging north faces in a single winter.Ballard’s mother was Anna Hargreaves, the first woman ever to climb Everest solo in 1995 and who, equally famously in the eyes of the press at the time, then died descending K2 the same year, leaving behind a husband, Jim, and two children, Tom and his sister Kate.\u0026nbspShe carried Tom up the north face of the Eiger in the Swiss Alps when she was six months pregnant, and after he was born the family moved to Scotland so Hargreaves could practice on the local crags.The story of how Ballard came to attempt this particular mountain –\u0026nbspthe mountain where his body will remain unless and until a recovery attempt is made –\u0026nbspis as much about his co-climber Daniele Nardi as it is about the way this extraordinary, exhilarating yet occasionally deadly sport has evolved since Ballard’s mother’s own demise.Ballard, 30, and Nardi, 42, were attempting to reach Nanga Parbat’s 8,126m peak via the most direct route, the Mummery Spur. It is an audacious approach, flanked on both sides by towering ice walls that make avalanches a regular occurrence and requiring “mixed climbing” across both ice and rock, a technique beyond even some of the most proficient mountaineers.Created with Sketch.Peaks of Europe Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.‘Peaks of Europe’ is a photobook by Johan Lolos.

Published by LannooThe dangers and challenges are such that no one has ever successfully taken the Mummery Spur route in winter before. And for Nardi, who had already turned back from four previous attempts at the same expedition, that was the point.\u0026nbspThe Italian was obsessed with the route, says Pakistani climber and tour operator Ali Muhammad, who accompanied Nardi on his 2014-15 attempt but chose to turn back when conditions became too hazardous.In winter this mountain is so dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go – down or upNanga Parbat is known as the “Killer Mountain” for a reason, he tells The Independent. “In winter this mountain is so very dangerous very windy, many avalanches and cloudy, with zero visibility. Sometimes you have to stop on the wall because you cannot see where to go –\u0026nbspdown or up. Then we have no choice:\u0026nbspjust hold on until we get better weather.”It was only three years ago, in early 2016, when an international team of climbers made the coveted first winter ascent of Nanga Parbat by any route, leaving K2 as the only mountain above 8,000m anywhere in the world that has yet to be conquered in winter.Muhammad says he understands the urge to conquer a mountain in a way that has never been done before. “Daniele and Tom were trying to make a new history in winter climbing,”\u0026nbsphe says.But the Mummery Spur, he says, is not just one of the hardest ways to summit Nanga Parbat\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspit is, in Muhammad’s view, the most difficult unconquered route anywhere in Pakistan, perhaps even the world.Nanga Parbat is seen as a far greater challenge for serious climbers than Everest\u0026nbsp(AP)Simone Mori, the star Italian climber among the group that completed the winter ascent in 2016, has described the Mummery Spur as “suicidal”. “It is ice, rocks, snow, and deep crevasses, and that’s just to reach Camp 2. After Camp 2 there are no crevasses. It is all vertical,” Muhammad says.Nardi and Ballard last made contact with base camp when they were at an altitude of about 6,300m. After a search of almost two weeks, their bodies were found using a high-power telescopic lens by Spanish climber Alex Txikon, another of the successful 2016 ascent team. The families consented to the release of the images, showing two figures and a tent lying close together on a small patch of snow at the bottom of a gully, surrounded by jagged rocks.What changed in the sport of mountaineering between Hargreaves’ generation and that of her son, Ballard, and Nardi? Everest is still Everest, the highest peak on the planet, its height unchanged,\u0026nbspmore or less,\u0026nbspfrom 1995 to 2019.Rather what has changed is our perception of what is humanly possible, argues Jake Meyer, a mountaineer who at the age of 21 years and four months became the youngest Briton to scale Everest in 2005.\u0026nbspHe says that the cultural allure of Everest comes from the fact that it wasn’t climbed at all, that we know of, until Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay as late as 1953.The number of climbers worldwideAfter that, the landmarks tumbled:\u0026nbspin 1975, the first woman to reach the summit. In 1978, the first successful climb without supplemental oxygen. In 1980, the first winter summit. All the way to Hargreaves’ own achievement in 1995. To elite climbers, Everest now has little left to offer.Like Ballard, Meyer started climbing when he was young, gaining a degree of competency quickly so that his youth alone was basis enough to set new benchmarks and, almost just as importantly, attract the interest of sponsors to make the expeditions possible.\u0026nbspHe describes a never-ending “arms race” among professional mountaineers to keep pushing the boundaries and achieve things that have never been done before, or at least do them in a way that is new –\u0026nbspplaying with the “semantics”, he calls it.Nanga Parbat is the ninth tallest mountain in the world (AFPGetty)Nardi was keenly aware of this competition, and indeed saw it as integral to the sport. Pakistani mountaineer Karim Shah Nizari quoted him in a tribute after his death by saying: “He always said, ‘A climber is someone who climbs new routes’.”In a modern world of social media and round-the-clock connectivity, that urge to open up new frontiers and explore the world’s last wildernesses may be appealing –\u0026nbspbut it is also one “that has always been there” as a driving force for the great historic mountaineers, Meyer says.The difference now is that with Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, hundreds of thousands of fans around the world can follow their favourite climbers’ expeditions in real time.Nardi’s official Facebook page had more than 100,000 followers at the time of his death. The latest updates in the search and rescue operation for the pair were distributed direct to supporters by Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador to Pakistan. And Alex Txikon, who has more than 58,000 Facebook followers, shared dramatic photographs and video from the frontline of the search.Alex Honnold, the first solo climber to scale Yosemite’s El Capitan Could this new exposure, and the fact that sponsors pay a lot of attention to mountaineers’ status as modern influencers, be another factor leading them to take greater risks? It’s a question Meyer poses. “Everyone is so aware of what everyone else is doing,” he says. “You have\u0026nbspto be doing bigger, badder, more awesome and, as a result, slightly dangerous things to keep up? I think that if people are treating it like that, then it is a race to the bottom.”If mountaineering and climbing have taken an edgier and more extreme turn in the past 20 years, it isn’t just on new media formats that people are taking notice.\u0026nbspUp until the turn of the century, the sport was considered fodder for low-rent thrillers like Vertical Limit (2000, starring Chris O’Donnell), Cliff Hanger (1993, Sylvester Stallone) and The Eiger Sanction (1975).Something changed around the time of North Face (2008), a critically acclaimed German film about the competition to scale the most dangerous ascent of the Alps. In 2010, 127 Hours about mountaineer Aron Ralston’s fall down a canyon in Utah was runner-up for six Academy Awards.\u0026nbspFinally, this year the suspenseful Free Solo, about Alex Honnold’s successful climb up Yosemite’s El Capitan rock wall without a rope, won the Oscar for best documentary.I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel aliveClimbing is now officially cool –\u0026nbspand there are figures to back up the assumption that young people who might once have been inspired to take up skate- or snowboarding are now turning to their local bouldering gym instead.\u0026nbspIn North America, indoor climbing is set to be a billion-dollar industry by the year 2021, according to the Climbing Wall Association, with a record 43 new climbing gyms opening up across the US in 2017.The International Federation of Sport Climbing estimates 25 million people are climbing regularly worldwide, with the number of young competitors in the UK up 50 per cent in the past five years.\u0026nbspAnd in another landmark for the sport unthinkable a generation ago, sport climbing will feature at the summer Olympic Games for the first time in history next year at Tokyo 2020.Created with Sketch.Jake Meyer: youngest Briton to climb Mount Everest Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right110 Jake Meyer and K2210 Team climbing at 7400m on K2310 Ottalie and Poppy (with Daddy on the front page)410 Camp 4 on K2 - 7650m510 Jake on way to summit610 Climbing though the glacier710 Jake at summit of K2810 Ottalie, Jake and Saskia at Heathrow as Jake arrives home1010 Basecamp panorama K2 on left, Broad Peak on right“It’s amazing to see how much it’s changed over my career, and we’re talking 20 years since I watched the new millennium dawn over Kilimanjaro,” Meyer says.\u0026nbsp“It’s incredible, fantastic, and it’s an inspiration.”As the sport’s popularity continues to grow and its elite members keep pushing the limits of what’s possible, a point will be reached where mountaineering must pause and take stock of the element that makes it stand apart from other pursuits – the extraordinary risk to life involved.The Italian climber Mori has been the most outspoken in the community since Ballard and Nardi’s deaths, telling The Times newspaper that “if we continue to say they were just unlucky, the risk is someone will die there next year”.And if the trend continues for increasingly young climbers to seek out the road less travelled, in search of new and more impressive feats, the dangers posed are not just from the mountains themselves.\u0026nbspSearchight)Nowhere is this more evident than with Nanga Parbat. In 2013, a major terrorist attack was launched at the mountain’s base camp, itself a remote outcrop 4,200m above sea level that can only be reached on foot.\u0026nbspThe attack, claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, killed one local guide and 10 international climbers, among them an American-Chinese citizen who was believed to have been the prime target for the gunmen in a kidnapping gone wrong.In 2013 at Nanga\u0026nbspParbat\u0026nbspbasecamp a\u0026nbspterrorist attack by Pakistani Taliban claimed the lives of one guide and 1o international climbersAfter the massacre, the gunmen walked for five hours before eating breakfast at a village and dissipating in the small hours of the morning. An AFP report a year on from the attack suggested most, if not all of the perpetrators remained at large.\u0026nbspThe 2013 attack aside, the Gilgit Pakistan region where most of the country’s biggest mountains lie is generally very safe, far from the restive western border with Afghanistan.Trekkers and climbing enthusiasts are starting to return to the region in larger numbers and can expect encouragement from visa officials and a warm welcome from locals, says Karra Hadri, spokesman for the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the sport’s governing body in the country.\u0026nbspHadri, who remembers Ballard from the time when he visited Pakistan as a toddler with his mother and was carried up to K2 base camp on a porter’s back, says last year there were more than 40 major expeditions in Pakistan –\u0026nbspup from just one or two in the years after the 911 attack.The Bigger Red Nose Climb: Charity trek could do with less BallsStray dog follows climbers to become first to reach Himalayan summitWoman becomes first in India to climb ‘men only’ sacred mountainBut he is concerned that growing numbers of young people will come to the country seeking adventure and put their lives in danger. He is calling for a change to the regulations for permits, so that climbers must prove themselves on smaller peaks before attempting any of Pakistan’s five 8,000m-plus summits.“Mountaineering in Pakistan, especially above 8,000m, can be very difficult compared to the rest of the world,” he says. “We still have many mountains that have not been climbed, but youngsters need to know the risks. They should have a lot of skill, a lot of experience, and much budget. And they should go in a group,\u0026nbspnot just one or two alone.”Hadri was closely tracking the progress of the search operation over the past two weeks and was “very sorry to hear” about Nardi and Ballard’s fates. “Tom’s mother was a brave lady,”\u0026nbsphe adds.Ballard is survived by his sister, Kate, who posted a message on Facebook after he went missing thanking people across the world for their “love and thoughts”, and by his girlfriend Stefania Pederiva, who wrote: “I will find you in nature, in the rivers, in the trees, in the mountains, you will always be my most beautiful rock.”Nardi is survived by his wife Daniela and a son Mattia, who is just six months old.\u0026nbspAnd while the sport mourns two of its most promising sons, climbers as a whole are stoic about the risks they take in pursuit of their passion.\u0026nbspMeyer, who last year joined an elite group of only 10 Britons to have scaled K2, says he cannot imagine removing the element of danger from mountaineering,\u0026nbspdespite having, like Nardi, young children at home.“I don’t go to the mountains because I have a death wish. On the contrary, I go there because that’s where I feel alive,” he says.\u0026nbsp“If you remove the element of risk completely, then what you are left with is almost every other sport. Having children didn’t change my desire to want to go, but what it did was it gave me three times the reasons to come home safe.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating. Since the beginning of the crisis, movement on the island has been curtailed because friends and neighbours fearful of spreading the disease kept their distance from other farms.Created with Sketch.How the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak brought Britain to a standstill Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Around 150 dead cows that may have come in contact with foot-and-mouth disease are burnt on a funeral pyre at Great Warley Hall farm in Great Warley, Essex, 27 February 2001.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

The supermarkets described the CMA’s provisional findings into the merger, as “prohibition in all but name”.Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe and Asda chief executive Roger Burnley added: “We have asked the CMA to correct significant errors in its provisional findings.Created with Sketch.

EU supporters dressed in costumes, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 march in central London, They came, young and old, Labour and Tory, by train and by plane, from the four corners of the UK. They came bearing balloons and banners, face paints and flags – and, above all else, smiles and good humour.“Have you ever seen a more polite crowd?” asked Silvia Angelotti, an Italian business analyst who has lived in London for 22 years. “Believe me, a march of a million people in Italy – it is not so calm, not so orderly, I think.”Heseltine says PM’s No10 speech ‘affront to parliamentary democracy’The best signs from the Put It To The People march in London‘Million’ protesters gather in London for march against Brexit Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumSurrounding Ms Angelotti as she walked down Whitehall – to where speakers included London mayor Sadiq Khan, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and The Independent’s editor Christian Broughton – was a sea of noise and a mile of colour. Or, rather, a mile of blue and yellow.The shades of the EU were everywhere, from teenagers resplendent in streaks of yellow eyeliner to mums (and dads) donning long blue wigs. Think cup final day on Wembley Way, and you have the right sort of vibe. Only here, supporters were asking – given the closeness of the first result, given the misinformation they say was spread, and given the ever-unfolding sense of calamity – for a chance to rethink and replay.“That’s not an unreasonable request,” said Sorcha Kirker, an archaeology student at University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) in Scotland. “Theresa May has given parliament two votes on this – and she wants another – so why are the people being denied a second say? That isn’t democracy.”Ms Kirker herself\u0026nbspwas speaking after a 28-hour journey to be in London. The 27-year-old lives on Orkney. To get to the capital, she had to leave home at 4.30am on Friday, take a boat to the mainland town of Thurso, travel by train to Inverness, and then, at 9pm, catch the 12-hour overnight bus to London.If you’re reading this anytime between 8.30pm on Saturday and 10pm\u0026nbspon Sunday, she’s still on her way back home again.“Am I tired?” she asked. “Well, I got about two hours sleep on the bus so that’s something. You come to something like this and adrenalin takes over anyway. There are 24 of us here from the UHI, and we’ve all come because this is too important to miss because of something like geography. It’s our future. Brexit is a disaster. It takes away so many opportunities from young people that our parents had – that can’t be fair.”She and her group were carrying massive EU flags – but placards were largely the order of the day.Indeed, if national referendums could be initiated by the sheer originality of signs being waved alone, it’s probably fair to say, the Electoral Commission would, right now, already be organising a Final Say vote.They varied from pop cultural references (“Frankie Says Remain”) to the poetic (“Let’s stay among the stars”), to the somewhat crude: “If only Nigel’s dad had been so keen to pull out,” read one.Bright yellow stickers featuring the slogan “Bollocks to Brexit”, meanwhile, were everywhere. Including, by the end of the day, entirely covering the Cabinet Office front door in Whitehall. After one person\u0026nbspstuck their sticker there, hundreds more protestors followed suit – turning this historic door yellow.“If Theresa May really thinks she knows how we feel, she might want to look at her own Cabinet Office entrance next time she passes,” said Rob Hollinger, as he added another circular sticker to the mass. “She says she speaks for the British public. She doesn’t speak for anyone here.”It was a sentiment shared by 14-year-old Jacob Henry. “I got off my Xbox to be here,” his placard told the world.The youngster, from Milton Keynes,\u0026nbspwas there with his parents and 16-year-old sister Alice.“I don’t know if any of this will make a difference,” his dad Leroi, a 49-year-old academic, said. “But maybe the momentum is starting to move in favour of a second vote. I feel the country is starting to shift but I don’t know if it will be too late. But I just think, as a family, we felt we had to try to do something. We had to be able to say in future we gave this a shot.”Pursued by a toilet, Farage’s foot soldiers slog 270 miles for BrexitIt was a hopefulness and positivity that infused the spirit of the whole procession.With a petition asking for Article 50 to be revoked topping 4\u0026nbspmillion signatures even as the march started, many people felt, now more than ever, the tide of opportunity was turning towards them.Certainly Alice Joinel hoped so. She was the mother of possibly the youngest march participant of all. Carried in a papoose\u0026nbspwas nine-week-old Anouk.“How’s she found it?” said Alice, who works in publishing in London. “She’s actually slept through most of it. Woke up for the odd feed, then gone back to sleep again. She seems pretty unfazed.”The 32-year-old came because she felt it was important for the little one’s future.\u0026nbsp“Leaving the European Union is going to make her future so much harder and with so fewer opportunities,” she said. “And as a parent, that’s unbearable. So we had to come. Her dad – my partner –\u0026nbspis actually French, so you might say she wouldn’t even be here without the EU – that’s how important it is to us.”As the day came to a close – anti-Brexit chants still filling the twilight – a band could be heard finishing off in Trafalgar Square: Brass Against Brexit.How did march go for the group?“Brilliant,” said James again. “A few of us in this band play\u0026nbspGlastonbury every year and we’ve played the Rio carnival and, of course, it’s impossible to compare. But this was special: just people getting into it, waving their flags, giving us thumbs up. It felt like we were a part of\u0026nbsphistory.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

By the early hours of Sunday morning\u0026nbspmore than 4,750,000 people had signed.The official website has crashed numerous time since the petition leapt in popularity on Wednesday following Theresa May’s appeal to the British people to support her as she demanded MPs back her deal.Signatures continued to be added even after the threat of a no-deal exit on 29 March was removed when EU leaders agreed Brexit could be delayed.Asked about the growing number of signatories on Thursday, Ms May said she did not believe in halting the deadline after the EU offered a delay plan.Created with Sketch.

This includes British citizens living overseas.”Analysis by software firm Tableau of the 16,000 petitions running on the government website showed the revoke Article 50 petition had more than three times as many signatures as all the pro-Brexit petitions combined.After the number of signatures passed one million, the petitions committee, a cross-party group of MPs appointed to examine petitions to parliament, said the rate of signing was the highest its website had ever had to deal with.Organiser Margaret Anne Georgiadou wrote: “The government repeatedly claims exiting the EU is ‘the will of the people’.“We need to put a stop to this claim by proving the strength of public support now for remaining in the EU.

To allow the house to seek a majority on the way forward”. This was confirmed by Mr Clark, the business secretary, on Friday,There are several ways that this could happen.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThe government could hold its own indicative votes, as promised, if\u0026nbspMs May’s deal is defeated.Seven possible\u0026nbspoutcomes are likely\u0026nbspto be voted on: the prime minister’s deal, a fresh referendum, revoking Article 50, a no-deal exit, a deal involving a permanent\u0026nbspcustoms union with the EU, a deal involving a customs union and\u0026nbspaccess to the single market, and a less comprehensive agreement in the form of a free trade deal.However, a group of senior backbench MPs, including former Tory ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve\u0026nbspand Labour’s Hilary Benn, has said the\u0026nbspgovernment should not be allowed\u0026nbspto set the terms of the votes.\u0026nbspThey have tabled a Commons amendment that would pave the way for indicative votes to be held next Wednesday, regardless of whether or not the government agrees.MPs to be offered free votes on ‘plan B’ Brexit, says Kwasi KwartengOne of those involved, former Conservative minister Nick Boles, said it was crucial that MPs, not ministers, are allowed to define the options to be voted on.He said: “MPs supporting the different options must be in charge of defining them and control the drafting of the motions. Otherwise they will be setting us up to fail.“We have all been working very hard to craft alternative compromises and the government, frankly, hasn’t a clue where the potential for consensus lies because it hasn’t engaged properly.”Then there is the question of the process by which\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspwould actually vote.One system would see the Commons ide on a series of yesno votes on specific proposals in the usual way.\u0026nbspNorway-style Brexit may not be right for UK, says Icelandic PMWho is left to stop Theresa May from leading us to a no-deal Brexit?Seven Labour frontbenchers set to join Put it to the People march This is likely to appeal to Downing Street because, if all the alternatives were voted down, Ms May could insist her deal was the only viable outcome. The danger, though, is that no option receives a majority.\u0026nbspIn a bid to avoid this “last man standing” scenario, an alternative devised by Sir Oliver would involve indicative votes\u0026nbspusing a paper ballot, adapting the “deferred isions” method\u0026nbspused to hold some Commons votes.\u0026nbspThis would allow MPs to rank Brexit outcomes in order of preferences, rather than simply voting yes or no to each one.\u0026nbspAnother proposal\u0026nbspwould see various rounds of voting held, with the least popular option being discarded at each stage.If\u0026nbspindicative votes are to uncover the basis for a possible consensus in parliament, MPs would need to be free to vote with their conscience\u0026nbsprather than whipped by their parties.Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng appeared to confirm this on Friday, telling the Commons: “If the house is being asked to decide a way forward, it would be surprising if those votes were not free votes.”If Ms May’s deal is rejected once again, it is likely\u0026nbspthat parliament will\u0026nbspbe given its first formal opportunity to vote on what type of Brexit it wants –\u0026nbspjust days before Britain was supposed to be leaving the EU.With ongoing doubts over whether any option would command a Commons majority, though, it is far from clear whether indicative votes\u0026nbspwill provide the route out of the crisis that supporters hope they will.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

Brexiteers will undoubtedly want a credible Leave option, possibly no deal, while pro-EU campaigners will demand\u0026nbspthe chance to stay in the EU on the ballot.I haven\u0027t marched for 50 years – but I will for a Final Say on BrexitStudent leaders sign letter urging May to hold Final Say referendum Celebrities fund transport to Brexit protest for new EU referendumHere’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit rulingThe people will have a Final Say on Brexit. It\u0027s inevitableTo trigger a Final Say referendum, the government would need to support the plan. Ms May has always been firm in her opposition to another public vote – but the public will remember she\u0026nbspbroke her promise not to hold a general election in 2017. She is also running out of options to resolve the Brexit crisis.One scenario could see Ms May offer a second referendum to MPs in exchange for supporting her Brexit deal. Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle have worked up an amendment for a “confirmatory vote”, where approval of the prime minister’s deal in the Commons would be conditional on throwing the question to the public.The Kyle-Wilson plan, as it is known, was drawn up in consultation with Jeremy Corbyn’s frontbench, suggesting it could secure that all-important Labour support in the Commons.It\u0026nbspmight\u0026nbspovercome speaker John Bercow’s ruling that the prime minister cannot bring back her deal without “substantial changes”. Her Brexit plan would certainly look different if it had a second referendum attached to it.Another scenario gaining momentum in Westminster is indicative votes. These would test the will of parliament by giving MPs a series of non-binding votes on their preferred Brexit options.It is expected to come to a head on Monday when cross-party backbenchers, led by Labour’s Hilary Benn, attempt to seize control of the Commons timetable to allow for indicative votes on Wednesday.Downing Street is understood to be considering seven different options for the votes, including the prime minister’s deal, a second referendum, a no-deal Brexit or the deal plus membership of a customs union and single market.If a second referendum wins\u0026nbspa large backing, then the prime minister will be forced to give serious consideration to the prospect.We’ll tell you what’s true.

She said her helicopter ride to safety came amid strong winds “like a tornado,” causing her to pray “for the safety of all aboard”.Hustadvika rescue centre (AP)US passenger John Curry said he had been having lunch as the ship started to shake. “It was just chaos.

The evacuation is proceeding with all necessary caution.“A small number of non-life threatening injuries have been reported. Guests are being accommodated in local hotels when they arrive back on shore, and Viking will arrange for return flights for all guests.”A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: “We are in touch with Norwegian authorities and stand ready to help any British people who require our assistance.”The operator advised anyone with concerns about guests\u0026nbsponboard to check updates on the Viking Cruises website.Additional reporting by agenciesWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Thai voters went to the polls on Sunday in a long-delayed election following a 2014 coup, a race that pits a military junta chief seeking to retain power against a democratic front led by the populist party he ousted.Turnout was expected to be high among the 51.4 million Thais eligible to vote for the 500-seat House of Representatives, which will choose the next government along with a Senate that is appointed entirely by the ruling junta.Thailand has been under direct military rule since then-army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha overthrew an elected government linked to exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself was thrown out by the army in 2006.Critics have said a new, junta-written electoral system gives a built-in advantage to pro-military parties and appears designed to prevent the Thaksin-linked Pheu Thai Party from returning to power.Pro-Thaksin parties have won every election since 2001, but the past 15 years have seen crippling street protests that destabilised the government and hamstrung business.Created with Sketch.

I want to see love and unity. Everybody has one vote, one voice. Everybody wants democracy.The anti-Thaksin Yellow Shirts, mostly middle class and urban royalists who accuse his parties of corruption, have repeatedly taken to the streets, prompting the military to launch two coups in a decade.Thaksin\u0027s supporters, known as the Red Shirts, also occupied much of Bangkok\u0027s main business and shopping districts for months in 2010 after a court dissolved a pro-Thaksin government, again paralysing commerce until a crackdown that left at least 90 people dead and saw landmark buildings burned.While the election results are due to be announced within a few hours of polls closing at 5pm (10am\u0026nbspGMT), the make-up of the next government may not be clear for weeks, since no one party is likely to have enough seats for an outright win.The country\u0027s king made an unexpected and cryptic statement hours before the vote, recalling a comment made by his late father in 1969 on the need to put good people in power and to prevent bad people from ... creating chaos.Although he did not refer to any of the sides in the race, there was speculation on social media that it was a coded reference to the country\u0027s political factions - broadly the middle class and urban establishment, who identify with the monarchy and the military, and their pro-Thaksin opponents.The king\u0027s intervention was a departure from the approach of his father, who in his latter years usually kept a distance between the monarchy and politics.It followed a startling turn of events last month when a party allied to Pheu Thai nominated Princess Ubolratana, the king\u0027s sister, as its prime ministerial candidate. It was then disqualified by a court after the king said it was inappropriate for members of the royal family to enter politics.Thai voters prepare for return of democracy despite \u0027rigged\u0027 systemKatie Price fails to attend court and heads off to Thailand insteadAustralians welcome refugee footballer after Thailand sets him freeWhat happened last month ... and then the announcement last night shows that, in contrast to the former reign, that the monarchy is actively interested in monitoring what\u0027s going on and it feels that it has some stake in the future direction of the country, said David Streckfuss, a Thailand-based independent scholar.The junta-written electoral rules ensure the military will continue to have a say in the next government, even if Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha does not stay on as prime minister.Pro-Thaksin parties are expected to win the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives. However, the new system appears designed to prevent it from forming a government because it includes the junta-appointed 250-seat Senate in the vote for prime minister.The provision means Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha\u0027s Palang Pracharat Party and allies have to win only 126 seats in the House, while Pheu Thai and its potential democratic front partners would need 376.Among the potential Pheu Thai allies is the new Future Forward Party, led by 40-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, whose criticism of the junta has been scathing and faces charges under the Computer Crimes Act for a critical Facebook speech. Prosecutors have said they will decide whether to put him on trial days after the election.Created with Sketch.

Old parties may end up fighting again, so I think the new party is better, said Somkiat Rattanawibun, a 42-year-old business owner told Reuters after casting his vote in Bangkok.Two officially non-aligned parties could be decisive in whether pro-military or democratic front factions make up the next government.Former Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the anti-Thaksin Democrats, has portrayed himself as a third way between the dictatorship of keeping Mr\u0026nbspChan-ocha and a return to the corruption on Thaksinism, but he would likely have to side with one or the other to form a government.The Bhumjaithai Party of Anutin Charnvirakul placed third in the last election of 2011 and has grabbed attention for populist campaign promises such as legalisation of recreational marijuana and a four-day work week. It\u0027s unclear which side he would choose.Regardless of the make-up of the government, the election result is likely to yield a shaky coalition that will do little to soothe Thailand\u0027s deep political ides and may not be able to accomplish much, said Paul Chambers, lecturer in political science at Naresuan University in northern Thailand.There could be a stable government coming out of it in the short term, he said. But that kind of coalition is not going to last that long.We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view.At The Independent, no one tells us what to write.

here we have pulled together ten of the most outrageous houses from all over the world.Dubbed the Heliodome, this house in France has been described as the “ultimate solar architecture”.Its eye-catching design - constructed by a cabinet maker - is not just for a unique look but to capture the maximum amount of solar rays as possible.It provides free heating in the winter and cools down the house in the summer.But although it is an eco-friendly way of producing heat, many locals have complained about it’s look saying it doesn’t fit in with the French countryside.The giant seashell house is a joy to look at - with dozens of coloured mosaics that light up the indoors living space.The multicoloured house is in Mexico City and was built in .It is full of plants and natural light after being carefully designed but has all the features to make it a modern home.Despite its unusual shape it was designed to fit in with the natural surrounding and make the occupants feel like they were immersed in the wilderness.This WC-shaped house is made from steel, white concrete and glass, with a suggestive opening in the roof.It is in Seoul, South Korea, and continues the bathroom theme as it is full of toilets.The toilet house was built by Sim Jae-duck, chairman of the organising committee of the Inaugural General Assembly of the World Toilet Association.It is called “Haewoojae” which means “a place of sanctuary where one can solve one’s worries” in Korean.The upside down house is in Affoldern, Germany, and took only six weeks to build.It cost about €, and has an interior which is very disorientating to visitors.It was build in the village near the Edersee Lake in , and comes complete with bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom.Every item, including crockery, a bath, knives and a toilet, is glued to the ceiling.Star Trek fans can live in a replica of the Voyager, complete with out of this world lighting and decor.The studio flat in Hinckley, Leicestershire, has been lovingly decked out with the main commands control.No detail has been overlooked in the m flat in the Midlands.It went on sale in  for £,.The Keret House in Warsaw, Poland, was the world’s narrowest house when it was built in .The tiny structure is squeezed in between two other buildings and has been described as more of an art installation.Apparently not as claustrophobic as it looks at cms at its widest point, a long ladder takes the occupant up through ious rooms, which look more like shelves.It was planned to be a temporary home for travelling writers.This snappy home is the work of an artist who died two months before it was completed.The crocodile house in the middle of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is completely hollow.It was completed in  and is now lived in by Thierry Atta, who helped to build it.With windows and a bedroom the unique home is completely liveable and is a popular meeting place for many people in the neighbourhood.This lonely house was built in the middle of a river in .It is perched on a small rock near the Serbian town of Bajina Basta.It was built by a group of young men who thought the rock would be the best place for a tiny shelter, after they needed to rest while out swimming.The man who lives there today was part of the group and has seen off floods and high winds in his little home.One of the strangest homes in the world is one shaped like a giant glittering grand piano and a violin.It is in Huainan, China, and was built in .It features a glass violin propped up against the huge piano, which is the entrance to the house.The piano has a roof terrace beneath a canopy shaped like it’s open top."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT0004774113141.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"take what we can on brexit and scarper","story":"This is according to the World Happiness Report.While the rest of the world is sinking into psychological depression, we’re much more upbeat.Some of the British Press reporting this have used those dread words: “Despite Brexit . . . ”It wouldn’t occur to them that it might be BECAUSE of Brexit.I suspect for  per cent of us that’s pretty much the case. Maybe to keep up levels of national happiness we should leave horrible, authoritarian bureaucracies every year. Just to put a grin on our faces. I mean, the French don’t seem very happy, do they But here’s the bad news. Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite. Biologists would argue exactly the same.When is this madness going to stop And don’t the Old Bill have better things to do with their time Why should this be  Are they simply delighted they’re not Swedish Other stats might give us a clue.Finland also has one of the highest rates of alcoholism in the world. And also one of the higher suicide rates.So they rate highly for happiness because a they’re all perpetually p***ed b the sad ones have all topped themselves.GORGEOUS, pouting Olivia Attwood has been complaining that reality TV stars are prone to mental illness because of the horrible abuse they get online.Perhaps she’s right. There are some nasty t***ers out there, for sure.But might it not also be the case that reality TV stars are prone to mental illness anyway, without the trolls Being famous just for the sake of being famous appeals to a certain kind of rather fragile, insecure personality, I would reckon.THE Oxford English Dictionary has been updated to include the usual raft of gender words. Such as “zir” and “hir” and the horrible “peoplekind”.I hope they have room next year for these following words I’ve just made up: Togerov – a Bulgarian man who has transitioned to female.Abbottophobia – the irrational fear that Diane is about to appear on the TV talking complete b******s.Droll – an internet troll who is nonetheless quite funny.WYLFWTS– someone on a gender studies or media studies course. From the acronym Would You Like Fries With That, Sir IT is time to sort out the gamekeepers – once and for all.A new study has suggested that they are responsible for the illegal killing of one of Britain’s rarest birds, the hen harrier.These scumbags are believed to have killed almost THREE QUARTERS of tagged hen harriers. The killings take place on grouse moors.These moors occupy a vast area of the country.But they are managed for the benefit of a tiny number of iniduals. And the local wildle is destroyed.AMONG the names Scottish people gave to their newborn babies in  were Lucer, Awesome and Adora-belle.I hope Lucer doesn’t feel victimised in what is primarily a Christian country. And I hope Awesome doesn’t end up sleeping rough in Sauchiehall Street with wee seeping out of his trousers.That would be an ironically cruel fate.But it’s good to see that the most popular name in Scotland for boys was Jack. As in the Union Jack.A BUNCH of nutters are off to Antarctica.The Flat Earth Society is planning a trip to the South Pole to prove once and for all that the earth is indeed the shape of a tea tray. Not a globe at all.It thinks there’s a big ice wall at the edge of Antarctica and it’s impossible to get over.Some of them think that actually the world – and all the stars and planets – are enclosed in a giant dome. A bit like The Truman Show, then.“Why does the moon give out its own light,” one of them asked. .I don’t get these people. Everyone knows the world is triangular, with us at the top, followed by all the good, hard-working protestant countries.That was Zain Osman’s excuse to the court. Well, fair enough. Quite often I’m disgusted at the immorality in modern Britain.And when that happens I immediately shove my hands down the trousers of the first bloke I see and start tugging on his old fella.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Leavers are doing the same to avoid delaying or cancelling Brexit.In the crossfire stands Theresa May who — for all her faults — insists she is determined to do right by the people, by our democracy and by the .million majority who voted Leave.The PM has made many errors. But, against mountainous odds and a Remainer-dominated Parliament and civil service, she has at least followed Brexit’s inescapable logic: that it must mean exiting the EU’s main institutions, the single market and customs union.The Sun will not pretend her deal is great. It is just the only one available. It gets Brexit done, as promised. And it does have merit for Leavers, whatever Tory backbenchers protest. Defeat it again and the Government could fall in a no-confidence vote.We do not believe the Tories will win an electionpanicked Remain MPs have halted Brexit, especially with Mrs May in office. They will be punished by Leavers they have failed and Remainers who have already jumped ship.Corbyn is one of Britain’s most reviled politicians, in a crowded field. But his party — cheerleaders for the same debunked ideology now starving Venezuelans to death — could win by default Tory voters don’t turn out.The consequences for our jobs and economy would make a No Deal Brexit look like a picnic. Tory MPs must wake up. This is not a parlour game. An election has never looked closer. Handing power to ­Corbyn will define your careers.But Labour moderates should wake up too before they oppose the deal again.They’ll be left campaigning to put an anti-Semitic Marxist extremist and terrorist sympathiser in Downing Street.CONSIDER the rancid dishonesty of ­Labour’s Brexit position.They claim to be aghast at our national crisis. Except they could resolve it instantly by backing Mrs May’s deal.Why not  They agree with almost every word, except that it does not lock us into a permanent, restrictive customs union. Oh, and it’s a “Tory Brexit”, that meaningless phrase designed to maintain the pretence that there’s dference between their positions.Labour’s sole motive is political gain. The same reason they farcically back leaving and remaining. And why they are for and against a second referendum.They don’t want this crisis to end, nor an orderly Brexit. They relish chaos. It is their best chance to seize power.Only a mug would believe Corbyn, McDonnell or the snakelike Keir Starmer have Britain’s interests at heart.Their priority is not our country.

But this country won’t know where things are going to end up until April .On Wednesday, No Deal ­suddenly seemed a likely option again. The EU were saying they would only grant Theresa May’s request for an extensionher Brexit deal passed before March , something that is highly unlikely.I am told that at the No Deal ministers’ meeting on Wednesday night, “the mood was totally dferent to previous meetings, as people thought it might actually happen”.It was agreed that a small group of ministers — Theresa May’s effective deputy David Lidington, Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Health ­Secretary Matt Hancock, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley — would meet again on Friday morning to take the preparations to the next stage.But on Friday morning that meeting was cancelled.Why  Because after the EU agreed to halt the UK’s ­departure until at least April , No Deal is once again highly unlikely.This delay meansMay’s deal fails again, ­Parliament will have enough time to step in and take ­control of the process.The three options now are: May’s deal passes, a softer Brexit is agreed in the next few weeks, or there is a much longer extension to allow a General Election to be held, which could mean no Brexit at all. At the moment, the Brexit deal isn’t going to pass.Getting it through was always going to be hard, but the errors Mrs May made this week have made it even more ­dficult.As one Secretary of State puts it: “She would have been much better off spending three days in bed.”Her speech on Wednesday night, criticising MPs, was also ill-judged, given that they are who she needs to win over.It was particularly mistaken given May had turned down an invitation to address her own MPs that evening.One normally mild-mannered backbencher tells me: “It was offensive to us. You decline to come and talk to us — then insult us.”The Government’s domino strategy for winning the vote required getting the DUP to come on board.There is only one way to change this dynamic — for May to offer to goher deal passes.This would instantly change the debate. In the past few days, one Tory MP who wants No Deal and another who wants a second referendum told me they would vote for a ­withdrawal agreementthey had a guarantee she would go.“An increasing number of people are saying their vote is contingent on her going,” says a senior backbencher.As one Cabinet minister admits: “Even that may not be enough.” But without it, there’s no chance of the deal passing next week.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.AMID all this uncertainty, one thing is looking increasingly clear: Britain will have a new Prime Minister soon.Opinion has turned against Theresa May ­following her ill-judged speech on Wednesday.“She has managed to offend everybody,” one previously loyal minister tells me.And one Secretary of State fumes: “She’s alienated Parliament, the Cabinet and the EU.”There are no shortage of leadership candidates sounding people out.Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, has the support of more ­Cabinet ministers than anybody . He is seen as a safe pair of hands and as having the ­emotional intelligence to hold the party together.Sajid Javid was the frontrunner. But as always happens in Tory leadership contests, that has put a target on his back. He has had a dficult few weeks and is losing support.Cabinet ministers are convinced that Andrea Leadsom is running. They point out how, at Cabinet this week, she spoke in a string of highly quotable lines about Leave voters being let down.Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is also expected to go for it. But many think she is more interested in framing the debate and pushing her pro-growth agenda than anything .Michael Gove is being urged to stand, with Mel Stride, the well-connected Treasury minister, at the forefront of efforts to persuade Gove to run.Matt Hancock is another being encouraged to enter the race. He is the new toast of the party donor classes, who think he offers competence. One MP describes him as “a better version of Jeremy Hunt”.On the backbenches, Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson are competing to be the Brexiteer ­candidate. Raab’s campaign is better organised – he has ten MPs gathering support for him.But Johnson has the proven electoral record and greater experience. One thing to remember, though. Tory leadership races are like the Grand National: Messy, unpredictable and the favourite rarely wins. THE absurdity of Labour’s Brexit position is that it accepts the withdrawal agreement.What it takes issue with is the political ­declaration, which isn’t legally binding.Voting through the Brexit deal would not stop Labour from getting to any of the softer Brexit ­outcomes that it has been proposing in recent months.You could negotiate almost any kind of Brexit from the withdrawal agreement.But Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t want to vote for it because he doesn’t want to vote for a “Tory Brexit”.It would bring the withdrawal agreement, ­without the political declaration, to the Commons and dare Labour to vote it down.If Labour blinked and the withdrawal agreement passed, we would then be out of the EU and into the transition ­period.The EU would also be satisfied and consider us to have ratied the agreement.If Labour voted down the withdrawal agreement, then it would be clear what their motives were.IF there is no chance of the Brexit deal ­passing unless Theresa May promises to go, who can tell her that This is what ministers have been discussing with each other in the past  hours.

Thai dictator Prayut Chan-ocha and his junta have shamelessly and systematically cheated throughout the election campaign.The Election Commission, which is entrusted with safeguarding the integrity of the polls and ensuring voting goes smoothly, has shown itself to be biased and incompetent.Pro-democracy parties have faced censure for the smallest alleged infractions, while the most blatant cheating by the junta has gone unpunished.For Thais who want true democracy, the situation seems hopeless. Many are questioning whether it is even worth voting.Phuket Provincial Police Deputy Commander Col Sermpan Sirikong told The Phuket News: The ban on the sale of alcohol is mandatory by law.Police will enforce it that same as we do for the five Buddhist religious days throughout the year.I believe that foreign tourists will understand that this is law must be followed.

I can sense we’re in the end game. I think she’s got  days left.”Yesterday senior Tory MPs openly texted each other saying Mrs May should go this week.Some want Deputy PM David Lidington to act as a caretaker to sort out the mess while a new leader is elected.Others favour a “triumvirate” run by Mr Lidington, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt.Government chief whip Julian Smith and his team are also on the brink of resigning over the PM’s refusal to listen.MPs tempers are fraying after she blamed THEM for the chaos in a TV outburst from Number  last Wednesday.In a meeting soon afterwards, her whips warned she now risks destroying not only Brexit but the Tory party, too.One member, Paul Maynard, was close to tears as he told her: “I think things are slipping away from us.”An insider revealed: “It was like murder on the Orient Express.”Each whip told her that they would not be able to find the numbers to get her deal through Parliament unless she made a public promise to stand down.But Mrs May’s response was to sit motionless for a few seconds then reply: “Thank you for your honesty.” She then quickly changed the subject.Mrs May has been left hopelessly cornered after her stubborn-ness and stalling tactics ran out of time and space.If she went for a “no deal” Brexit, half her Cabinet would resign. If she backed a two-year delay, the other half would walk out.The multi-choice vote on the best way forward is expected on Wednesday will almost certainly demand an extension beyond June  – which the PM has already insisted was unacceptable.A senior MP said: “She has less than three weeks to tell the EU what her next step is. If it’s an extension she is finished. Nobody is going to let her stay on the get us out of this mess.”The only formal process to remove her is a no-confidence vote of the  committee of MPs. But their failed bid to topple her in December means they cannot try again for a year.That means she has to be persuaded to resign – or brought down by a general election.Some angry MPs are suggesting the “nuclear option” a “Vote strike” until she gets the message.Mrs May’s allies yesterday warned that politics will be in meltdown unless they come to their senses and back the deal.THERESA May has been accused of being the Sven-Goran Eriksson of politics - having no Plan B.The PM has failed to set out another route out of the Brexit chaos remaining tight-lipped when quizzed this week by EU leaders.The Swede, who managed England between  and , was accused for not having a rescue strategy by pundits.Mrs May has written to all MPs to indicate she may not bring back her dealit can’t command enough support to secure victory.One Minister said: “Like Sven, she has no plan B when things go wrong. She just keeps moving the goal posts. She has now lost control of her dressing room.“She has been running down the clock but now the EU have blown the whistle.”Mrs May refused to sack Remain-backing Cabinet Ministers including Amber Rudd when she defied the party to keep no deal off the table infuriating colleagues.Another Minister added: “Everyday you hope the PM and Number  can’t make it any worse and then they do.”Hardline Brexiteers insist the PM should enact the law as it stands and leave without a deal when the deadline is reached at pm on Friday.But by agreeing to extend Article  last week EU chiefs have trumped UK law so it is now impossible to crash out.A Brexit-backing minister said: “Lots of Eurosceptics are thinking ‘one more push and we’ll get it over the line by Friday’ but the truth is they won’t.“A communique released by the European Commission last week has changed the rules.“So evenwe have carried out all the legislation required to leave the EU, that will be trumped by international law which dictates that the extension to Article  takes precedence.”Another pro-Brexit minister added: “Can’t they see that their Brexit dream is sinking before their eyes “They are behaving like passengers on the Titanic, who can see the ship going down but refuse to join a leboat and stand there pointing at the guarantee on the main deck.”Cabinet discipline has broken down with Business Secretary Greg Clark being accused “freelancing” when he announced the PM would back a series of indicative votes.One minister said: “Number  are furious as his attempt to bounce her into it. If she ends up having to go through with it, there will be some pretty angry people on the back benches, too.”If MPs seize control of the process this week, Mrs May could give Tories a free vote.Former minister Mark Francois, vice chairman of the European Research Group, said is proved she had given up the ghost on leading the country.He declared: “If the government of this country does not have a view on how to proceed and the most important question facing Britain since the end of the second world war then, in effect, we no longer have a government, just a collection of iniduals who call themselves ministers of the crown.Despite her best intentions and a dogged determination to see Brexit through, the chances of her deal ever getting Commons support are pitiably low.Some senior ministers put the likelihood of it passing next week at  per cent.The PM has seen her own authority seep away and is now unable to uny her own Cabinet, let alone the party in general.That means she is powerless even to call an election.As the  Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady points out here, her deal may be threadbare but it still offers the only realistic chance of Brexit actually taking place.Backing it would give Britain a chance of a new start. If the deal fails again it seems Philip Hammond and David Lidington will be knocking on the PM’s door to tell her the time has come to make an exit.But in the midst of this paralysing crisis even that is not an easy option.There is no clear route to appointing a successor in the short term. And with the party at loggerheads even a swt transition to a caretaker PM is perilous.After this week’s turmoil we face being stuck for some time with a lame-duck Prime Minister, whoever it may be.Britain needs a miracle to avoid it.“It’s a total and utter shambles and it’s all the Prime Minister’s fault.”A Number  insider said: “Everyone at Number  is losing their rag at the slightest issue. It really does feel like the last days of Rome. Bunker mentality has set in.”“Even in the early part of this week, the PM felt she could deliver her domestic agenda after getting Brexit through.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK itself has been more successful in recent years in growing its trade with markets outside the EU than with those that are inside the single market and customs union.It baffles me that so many British politicians have so little faith in Britain that they think we would be sunkwe had to stand on our own two feet.The mistakes that have brought us to this point are well known: agreeing to decide the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement before settling the future trading relationship with the EU agreeing to a “backstop” to prevent a “hard border” in Ireland allowing the militant Remainers in Parliament to damage Britain’s negotiating position by taking “No Deal” off the table and allowing our exit date to be deferred.If only we had accepted the EU’s offer two years ago to have a big Canada-Plus free trade agreement, we could have locked in certainty for business and spent the last two years trying to improve upon it!The question now is what’s the best way to achieve the proper Brexit that the British people voted for nearly three years ago I understand why so many of my Tory and DUP friends have voted against the PM’s deal. I told her in November the “backstop” made it impossible for anyone who wanted to leave the EU to vote for it: it could lock the UK into the EU customs union for ever.That is why I voted against it the first time. It’s also why I tabled the “Brady amendment” — which was voted through at the end of January, telling the PM to go back and ensure the “backstop” couldn’t become a permanent trap.When the Government’s lawyer Geoffrey Cox said the changes agreed would allow a way out in most circumstanceswe were faced with a tough choice.To take a risk and support the deal or keep voting against, hoping something better would emerge. It was defeated a second time, with a big majority against.Those of us who really want Brexit to happen and British politics to be able to get on with other things are now faced with taking a massive political judgment.By voting for the pretty threadbare deal Theresa May brought back from Brussels, we can ensure some sort of Brexit and then a new negotiating team that believes in what it’s doing can work to get something worthwhile out of the future relationship after we have left.If we don’t vote the deal through this week, it no longer looks like Theresa’s promise that “no deal is better than a bad deal” will be honoured. Two years ago,  per cent of you voted for a political party — whether Tory or Labour — that promised to implement the referendum decision.Two years on Labour is angling for a second referendumand lots of other MPs are pushing for a Brexit that amounts to staying in. Some want endless delay, a few are at least honest enough to admit they really want to ignore the decision of . million voters altogether.Meanwhile, the EU is creaking. Just as the EU is set for crisis, this country is poised for success.British businesses are sitting on big cash balances but are crying out for the certainty that will allow them to invest.If we deliver on our promise to leave in the coming weeks, Britain will prosper.

Marching bands, music, whistles, chants and cheers provided a noisy backdrop to the aposput it to the peopleapos march. Demonstrators wore blue and yellow berets and flew large EU flags above the crowd as the march slowly made its way to Parliament Square. A spokesman from the Peopleaposs Vote campaign earlier said: “It is almost impossible to put an exact figure on the size of this immense crowd because it is spilling out across central London. The start of the march at Park Lane has been filled to bursting point and many thousands of people are trying to make their way to Parliament Square through side streets. At the time the rally began, people were still arriving in Park Lane. Our estimate is based on professional expert advice and whatever the exact number, there can be no doubt that this ranks as one of the greatest protests  - possibly the biggest ever – that this country has ever seen. We have no doubt that this march is bigger than the last with our early estimate putting the size of the crowd at around  million.  James McGrory, the director of the People’s Vote campaign and one of the organisers of the march, said the campaign for a second Brexit referendum is now the biggest mass movement in Britain, dwarfing the membership of the main political parties. “People from all walks of le see can what they were once offered bears no relation to what is being delivered and they are angry about it because it feels like a bad deal is being rammed down their throats,” he told Reuters.    The Mayor of London kicked off the speeches criticising ‘party politics’ as delaying a Brexit deal. He said: “I have lived in London all my le. I have never seen London look so magnicent as you do today. “Just days ago we were in danger of falling off the clf which would have catastrophic consequences. “We have seen party politics repeatedly put ahead of national interest. “We have seen the government ignore our warnings time and time again. “It’s time to say loud and clear enough is enough.”  Addressing the crowd in Parliament Square, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson said: “We are one million strong.” He said he was there on behalf of his -year-old daughter. “She has told me to thank you for campaigning for her future,” he said. Mr Watson said the Prime Minister’s deal “pleases no-one”. “If you voted remain it’s a rubbish deal,you voted leave it’s a lousy deal. There are no winners, only losers,” he said. He added: “Brexit is stuck in the parliamentary pipeworks and it’s not going to find a way out.” Addressing his comments to Theresa May, he said: “I can only vote for a dealyou let the people vote on it too. “Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”   First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also took to the stage. She said: “I bring with me today solidarity from Scotland. “A land where  per cent voted to remain in the European Union. “Our voice has been ignored. “But it is not merely our voice that has been ignored - but the voice of the  percent who voted remain across the UK has been ignored. “And the voice of those wanting to leave but who could never have contemplated the maze that Brexit has become. Their voice is being ignored as well. “My message is for every European national living in the UK, in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland. “We think you are welcome here and we want you to stay. “What has been done to you by these Brexiteers politicians has been nothing short of desperation.” Concluding her speech to raucous applause and cheering she said: “Put this back to the people and let us sort Brexit.”  David Lammy MP for Tottenham also spoke to the protesters. He said: “They told us that we have £ million on the NHS. They lied. “They told us we could leave the EU with all of the benefits and none of the consequences. They lied. “They told us we would have  trade deals the minute they left. They lied. “And now we come together and say enough is enough.” Comedian and Great British Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig said: “It is women and minorities who will pay the price for Brexit just as we pay the price for austerity. “There’s no denying we did not have the facts. There were lies all over the country. “There are those who would like to drive that bus with all of us on it into the clfs. “Stop the bus. Listen to the people when they rise up and march.”  Among those taking part in the march are people who voted to leave in , but have since changed their mind. Leon French, , who works in the educational sector, said: “I am delighted to attend the Put it to the People March on Saturday so that I can make my voice heard loud and clear to Parliament that the public need a final say on this blindfold Brexit. “I voted to Leave in  and it is now completely clear to me we were given a blank cheque full of  promise. The easy solution to all our problems we were told Brexit would be has quickly unravelled to be a mess we will be cleaning up for years to come. Britain deserves better than this circus. Now that we know how Brexit will damage the whole of the UK, the public deserve the right to say loud and clear: this is not good enough.” And Emma Knuckey, , from Essex, said: “I’m coming to the march to demand a People’s Vote because I don’t want millions of people paying for my mistake. Seeing so many people who did not get a say in this be so affected is horric. The younger generation who will live the longest with the result, and the  million people made up of Europeans in the UK and Brits in Europe, deserve a final say.”  People of all ages took part and were passionate about the cause. Amelie Upson-Sandland, , says she is worried she won’t be able to see her family as she lives in France. With a European flag displaying the flags of each of the countries her relatives are from, the schoolgirl said: “If Britain leaves I’m worried my family won’t be able to see me or stay with me in France.” Dad Philip added: “I might have to get some kind of long term visa. But it’s more than that, we want to see all of our relatives. We are all over the place. “It’s Europe we want to be part of. We are European you can’t take it out of us.” Leaders agreed to extend Brexit to May Mrs May can get MPs to back her deal in the Commons at the third time of asking. If the vote is not passed, the UK will have to set out an alternative way forward by April , which could mean a much longer delay - with the UK required to hold elections to the European Parliament - or leaving without a deal at all.

Taking on the old boys’ club, trying to keep calm and carry on, ­cleaning up David Cameron’s mess. I’m past that point now. Mrs May has had her dream job for nearly three years. She was desperate to be the first female PM – and was mfed when Maggie beat her to it when she was still at uni. But she got her leopard-print- shod foot in the door of No – where she’s shown herself to be a leader without backbone, negotiation skills, charm or a persuasive voice – or sometimes a voice at all.  Forget running through fields of wheat, Theresa. Leading your country into oblivion could top that in the naughty stakes. Still, she’s right when she said this week that we’re “tired of the infighting, tired of the political games… tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit”. It’s true. I heard more sensible debate in Lord Sugar’s boardroom when I was on The Apprentice. Mostly, though, we’re tired of her. Tired of her inability to lead, show clear direction and convince her MPs, let alone anyone in Europe. Why would anyone believe it is her way or no way on Brexit, when she has built her leadership on a mountain of U-turns  We are living under a cloud of gloom and uncertainty and blaming other MPs, and ranting for the cameras does not prove she is “on our side”. It proves she is desperate. Perhaps she should look to ­ordinary folk like myself for some inspiration on how to get results.  In my world, as a busy working mum of two, I would relate this to my everyday le. And Brexit would become an egg. Say I’m boiling eggs for breakfast and my kids must choose how they want them. Of course they are never going to agree – Zac wants his hard- boiled and Amara wants her soft. I tell them they must pick one – their school bus is nearly here. But they won’t ­compromise. “Right,” I say through gritted teeth. “Last chance – hard or soft ” So they cut off their noses to spite their faces and have no eggs at all. I’m not a tyrant. I give them another option. “Have Nutella on toast!” I say. But still no deal. I refuse to call the head to say we will be late because we are still debating breakfast. I do not want to appear indecisive and open to exploitation. I want trust and respect. Plus, the head would give me a polite, “on your bike, love”. But I know the longer I drag it out, the weaker I look. My kids need boundaries. They need to know who is in charge. Andthey can’t come to a ­conclusion, tough. I don’t want them to walk all over me – I have to show strength. So they go to school hungry. Andyou have good friends they will slip you some crisps to keep you going anyway. OK, some intellectuals might laugh at my analogy. But right now, we are the laughing stock of Europe. So maybe you don’t need ­intellectuals running this country. You need real people with common sense. Truly fighting for our side. Not stumbling out of the EU with all kinds of egg on their faces.

One minister told the Sunday Times the Prime Minister’s judgement had gone “haywire”. Another said: “The end is night. She won’t be Prime Minister in  days time. David Lidington, Mrs May’s deputy, and Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary are both thought to be lining up to replace hershe agrees to step down. Tory MP George Freeman, Mrs May’s former policy advisor, tweeted: “I’m afraid it’s all over for the PM. “She’s done her best. But across the country you can see the anger. “Everyone feels betrayed. Government’s gridlocked. Trust in democracy collapsing. This cant go on. “We need a new PM who can reach out  build some sort of coalition for a Plan B.”    The embattled Prime Minister has been increasingly isolated this week, after a series of errors which caused ministers to question her decision making.On Wednesday night she delivered a broadcast address, blaming MPs for the Brexit gridlock - and angering many of her supporters.There have been reports that Tory donors are threatening to withdraw funding from the party. And on Friday the DUP published an excoriating statement, railing at her “inexcusable” failure at the EU summit in Brussels. Mrs May successfully faced down a no-confidence motion in her leadership in January, meaning she is immune from a formal challenge to her leadership for another nine months.    But ministers are now understood be ready to threaten to walk out en-masse unless she hands power to a ‘caretaker’ PM and walks away. Even Chief Whip Julian Smith, who is in charge of discipline in the Tory ranks, is reported to have told Mrs May she needs to set out plans for her departure from Number .And now there is reportedly jostling for position between Lidington, who has effectively been Mrs May’s deputy and stands in for her at PMQs , and Michael Gove, who stood against her for the party leadership in .While he is not officially Mrs May’s deputy, he is the most constitutionally likely to take the reins as a ‘caretaker’Number  suddenly becomes vacant. But one senior cabinet minister told the Mail on Sunday: “The British public will never forgive us , in a time of historical crisis, our answer is David Lidington. “This is where it is going to get very scary, whatever you think about it. “If we do not deliver Brexit, we are so unbelievably f*****, not only as a party or a government, but in a national way. Now is the time to be bold.”    After another turbulent week for the Prime Minister which saw her come under fire for delaying Brexit and seeking to blame MPs for the impasse, the Commons was expected to be given the third chance to vote on her Withdrawal Agreement this week. But on Friday night Mrs May wrote to parliamentarians warningthere is insufficient support for her Withdrawal Agreement in the coming days that she could seek an extension to Britainaposs EU membership beyond the European Parliament elections. Mrs May said she was holding Brexit meetings over the weekend as she tweeted pictures of herself on the local election campaign trail in Milton Keynes.    Tory former Brexit secretary David Davis argued leaving without a deal on World Trade Organisation terms looks much better than the other options in front of us in a piece for the Sunday . He wrote: If Parliament rejects the deal on offer, the Prime Minister has it in her power to deliver a WTO outcome. That is what she should do. Andsome Ministers resign as a result  That would be a pity, but there are always volunteers to replace every departure.

Viewers picked up on a line in the show the toddler was sleepy in the hours before she was picked up by her parents from a daycare centre at the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in . People are now suggesting the McCann family were spied on and three-year-old Maddie was drugged by the kidnapper in the hours before she was snatched from her bed. Maddieaposs parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, were eating out with friends at a tapas restaurant close to the hotel and regularly checked up on their children before realising their daughter was gone. In the show itaposs said Maddie was sleepy on the day she was kidnapped and the fact her twin siblings, Sean and Amelie, failed to wake up when she vanished is adding fuel to the theory online.    Social media users believe the toddler was drugged after being watched by the kidnapper at the resortaposs Kids Club and that her brother and sister were also spiked. Nicola Begg said on Twitter in response to the show: So what[the kidnapper] had been watching Maddie, watched that the McCanns were leaving their apartment for dinner and checking every half an hour, then on the day she disappeared gave the three kids something to make them so tired they wouldn’t wake  Then went in after Gerry first checked on the kids, took Maddie easily as the kids had been drugged, sold her on etc  Just one theory. Fellow viewers of the eight part series, which retraces the steps of the moments leading to Maddieaposs disappearance and the subsequent investigation, agree it is a plausible explanation.    Maddie OaposLeary said: My opinion having watched episode   is that the McCann children were all sedated by someonethen someone abducted Maddie somehow and sold her through the dark web. Laura Spencer wrote: One theory - Kateaposs friends said Maddie was really tired coming back from the kids club. Possibly [someone] had his eye on her, drugged her earlier in the day to make sure she wouldnapost kick up a fuss when she was snatched later in the evening. The documentary series features more than  experts and people involved in the investigation.    But Kate and Gerry McCann refused to take part in the show. The programme covers ious versions of what may have happened  years ago from bungling cops pinning blame to Maddieaposs parents and claims she is still alive. Other parts of the show describe the dark trafficking side of Portugal with criminals able to transport stolen children easily to other countries.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have spent a reported £million renovating Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage , in the grounds of Windsor Castle, ­turning it from five flats into a house. On average,  flights pass within a mile of the house every half hour. On one day this week, that included a BA jet, which passed over the roof at , feet at pm. At .pm, a Virgin flight flew over at just , feet. The soundproofing measures are thought to include triple-glazed windows.    Windsor resident Karen Shawcroft said: “You do get used to it, but sometimes it’s an awful racket. A few people have been round to quote for that type of soundproofing, but it’s a great upheaval and is a lot of money.” The building work on Frogmore Cottage, which was a gt from the Queen, will be ­covered by the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, but it is expected that Harry and Meghan will pay for the soundproofing. The couple are leaving a two-bedroom Kensington Palace cottage to move to the five-bedroom house, with yoga studio and guest annexe, as they prepare to be parents. Meghan, , who is expecting their first child in weeks, has worked closely with builders during the renovations.    Plans reveal the addition of fireplaces and staircases. A £, “green” energy unit will provide heat, hot water and electricity and a satellite dish will be put up outside the property. Frogmore Cottage has not been substantially updated since Heathrow, five miles to the east, ballooned in size to become the world’s busiest two-runway airport, with , passenger flights every day. A source said: “Since the Seventies, just staff on the Windsor estate have lived there. Aircraft noise has always been a growing problem. I doubt they’ll spend much time in the garden with all that aircraft noise.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rachael bletchly new zealand shows","story":"NewsopinionRachael Bletchly: New Zealand shows true leadership in the wake of terrorNew Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern threw her arms around those affected by the horric Christchurch mosque shooting and brought solace to a grieving nationShareCommentsByRachael Bletchly:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsopinionJacinda Ardern \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIn the wake of the Christchurch massacres New Zealand’s Prime Minister has shown us what true leadership is. Compassion, eloquence and action have marked her out as a truly extraordinary politician. Her instinctive response to the tragedy brought the solace that her grieving ­nation needed. And the -year-old mother of a nine-month-old baby showed how raw emotion can be forged into steel. The terrorist who murdered  people at prayer had tried to sow hatred and ision among peace-loving Kiwis. She threw her arms around them and insisted “We are one.”    And, as the Muslim call to prayer was broadcast live on national TV on Friday, she joined them in worship saying: “We cannot know your grief, but we can walk with you at every stage.” The name of Jacinda Ardern, above, wasn’t widely known outside Australasia nine days ago. Now it is spoken with respect and admiration around the world. But I’m saddened that she has vowed never to utter publicly the name of the gunman, Brenton Tarrant. She says the white supremacist was trying to “lt his profile” and she will “absolutely deny him that notoriety”. Ms Ardern did not say whether she ­believes publicity fuels copycat attacks. But her words reminded me of Margaret Thatcher vowing to deny IRA terrorists “the oxygen of publicity” in the s and the farcical voice broadcast ban that followed.    Of course, we must continue to speak the names of the innocent people who died. Like Khaled Mustafa, , and his son Hamza, , three-year old Mucad Ibrahim, Sayyad Milne, , Linda Armstrong, , and Daoud Nabi, . They must not merge into one body of nameless “victims” of the atrocity. ButTarrant becomes “He Who Must Not Be Named” we risk mythologising him – treating him like a demon and not the inadequate little man he is. We have to highlight his pathetic humanity to challenge the idea that he’s any kind of warrior, to counter his sick “manesto” and murderous video and deny him a voice. We need to speak the criminal’s name as we utterly condemn his unspeakable crime. And Jacinda Ardern has the eloquence and steel to do that better than anyone.

These shocking images capture the growing crisis in mental health services. The low-paid workers were given the le-or-death job at NHS and private clinics raking in millions a year in NHS contracts. One of the images was taken at a mental health unit where a teenage girl killed herself earlier this year. Now worried patients and families have passed the evidence to us because of our Time to Change campaign to improve mental health services. The pictures are now being investigated by a health watchdog. One parent said: “No one seems to know what’s going on at night.” Another added: “You dread waking up to a call that something terrible has happened.” Two of the three healthcare assistants were doing agency shts and have since been barred by the providers.    Former care minister Norman Lamb said the images were “deeply shocking”. “Families have a right to expect loved ones will be safe in hospital,” he said. “These...facilities will charge the taxpayer thousands a week to keep a vulnerable person safe. But many depend on agency workers who may not have been well enough trained or supervised.” One of the disturbing pictures was taken at the privately run Potters Bar Clinic in Hertfordshire. Police and a coroner are now investigating the case of Nadia Shah who took her own le there in January. The secure mental health unit treats teens aged  to .Last week, Emma Duggan, , took a photo of the napping worker supposed to be watching over her.Her mum Lisa Powell, , a teaching assistant from Balham, South London, said: “My daughter has tried to kill and harm herself many times.She is in a clinic because she is a danger to herself. When she showed me photos of her carer sleeping at the end of her bed I was appalled.I haven’t slept properly at night since. You dread a phone call.” The clinic is run by Elysium Healthcare, a private firm with NHS mental health contracts worth millions a year.    Yet a job ad for healthcare assistants posted by Elysium this month advertises a salary of just £,.Healthcare assistant salaries in the NHS can be as low as £,, rising to just £, with a typical hourly wage of £., according to recruitment website glassdoor. A second picture of a sleeping worker was taken earlier this month at the NHS-run Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex – by a suicidal -year-old woman. The patient told us: “He dozed off in front of me. It’s frightening when the person whose job it is to prevent you killing yourself falls asleep.I have tried to hang myself and cut myself over the  years I’ve been in and out of mental health units. Luckily for me I wasnapost having a low mood.” She says a manager took her phone away after learning she’d taken the photo, but a matron ed it to her. A third photo shows another worker asleep on watch over a -year-old rape victim with PTSD.A patient at the Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal in Manchester, she was taken to the city’s Royal Infirmary with an allergic reaction.Two Priory care workers were assigned to travel with her as she was a high suicide risk.One – employed by agency Achieve Care Solutions – nodded off.The patient’s mum said: “After four hellish years my daughter is slowly recovering, but she has had many opportunities to kill herself while staff sleep at night. “This time she thought she’d show what goes on.”  Rising numbers of young people are being diagnosed with conditions like depression and bipolar disorder. And soaring rates of teenagers are being hospitalised. Yet despite the increased demand, funding in many parts of the country is being cut in real terms and hospitals don’t have enough resources to provide safe care.The Care Quality Commission said it would be launching an investigation after viewing the photos. Dr Paul Lelliott, CQC’s deputy chief inspector of hospitals, said: “Mental health inpatient services should ensure all regular and agency staff are qualied, competent and skilled to work with people with mental health conditions.” A TUC report on mental health services says they fail to meet rising demand.It claims in the last five years patients in England have risen by a third – , – while the number of mental health nurses, doctors and beds has fallen.Elysium Healthcare said they have a “zero-tolerance” approach to staff who fail to comply with “clear employment policies”. The firm said any worker sleeping on duty would be sacked. Essex ­Partnership University Trust – which runs the Linden Centre –  said the sleeping assistant, hired through Medilink Consulting, was on his first sht with them and would be banned. Nobody at Medilink Consulting was available for comment. The Priory Hospital Cheadle Royal said sleeping on duty was “gross misconduct” and they carried out night checks on staff. Achieve Care Solutions said the worker concerned had been sacked. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “Mental health and expanding the workforce are key priorities for this Government, which is why our NHS Long Term Plan includes an extra £.billion per year by   to further transform mental health services.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman ended up marrying convicted","story":"NewsWoman ended up marrying convicted killer after answering a newspaper advertEXCLUSIVE: Val Thatcher was  when she first started writing to George, a convicted killer.

Val Thatcher was a -year-old orced teacher way back in  when she first started writing to the man who would become her second husband. George Thatcher was serving le for shooting a worker dead in an armed robbery on a Co-op dairy, a crime for which he was originally condemned to be hanged. And as the unlikely pair corresponded, and then met over the next six years in jails around the country, their relationship gradually blossomed into romance. Astonishingly, it eventually led to a -year marriage that lasted until George died from a stroke in .    Today retired Val tells how she always believed George, a petty thief and safeblower, was framed for the killing for which he served  years. And a TV show re-examining the case could shed new light on it as modern-day legal experts give it their consideration. A team of barristers will st through evidence from the time and look at question marks over a verbal confession – potentially flagging up a miscarriage of justice. Val, now , said: “I have read George was a man addicted to unreasonable violence, which is so untrue. He was such a gentle person. He wouldn’t have hurt a fly. “It was all an image that was painted of him that just wasn’t true. “Even now, I still can’t help but be upset because of the injustice of what happened to him and the years wasted because of it.”    Val first made contact with George when he was doing time in HMP Albany on the Isle of Wight. Frustrated by what he claimed was his wrongful imprisonment, he had placed an advert in the upmarket magazine New Statesman and it caught Val’s eye. She recalled: “The best thing I ever did was to reply to his advert, which read. ‘Ler, aspiring dramatist and painter seeks new outlets through communication and visits’. “My reaction was ‘Gosh, there is somebody worse off than me’. I felt sorry for him so I wrote him a letter. “Women might write to prisoners to get a kick, but there was none of that prurient fascination – because I had no idea when I replied to the ad what George was supposed to have done. “We exchanged a few letters before I went to visit him a couple of months later. I was very nervous because I had never been inside a prison before but George was so kind and gentle, very dferent from what I was expecting. “He was a wonderful artist and I sent him photos of London because he loved to paint street scenes. He loved creative writing too and had written a play The Only Way Out.    “The manuscript was smuggled out of prison in a painting and was performed at the Royal Court Theatre in London in , which I encouraged people to watch. “It was only when I began toabout the case that I understood it. He always protested his innocence in prison and when I really got to know him, I started to believe him. “He really didn’t seem like an armed robber or a killer.” George was born in  into a childhood of abject poverty and by his s was a career criminal with a string of convictions. On November , , a gang of robbers struck at the Royal Arsenal Co-op in Mitcham, Surrey, and stole £. Detectives called to the scene found the manager’s office ransacked and the safe plundered. Outside, a depot vehicle sat abandoned with its window shot out. And a Co-op employee, father-of-two Dennis Hurden, lay leless at the entrance.  Within hours a getaway car had been found and soon three men, Philip Kelly, John Hilton and Charles Connelly, had been arrested. Kelly gave cops the name of George Thatcher, who denied not only that he shot Mr Hurden but that he had even been on the raid. There was no scientic evidence linking him with the crime and no ID parade was held. The key evidence used against George were statements from police, who testied that he had implicated himself.George was found guilty at the Old Bailey on March ,  of an offence known at the time as capital murder, which carried a mandatory death penalty. His co-accused Kelly, Hilton and Connelly were all convicted of murder and jailedfor le.Less than a month after the trial George’s sentence of execution was commuted to le imprisonment. And though he avoided the hangman’s rope he still spent nearly two decades locked up for a crime Val is still convinced he did not commit.    Val, who was living near Bristol at the time, said: “I never believed that writing to George would end up in us getting married but I wanted to offer him my support. “When we first met he was in Albany and then Parkhurst, where Ronnie Biggs and Mad Frankie Fraser were. Then he was transferred to Coldingley in Surrey, Gartree near Northampton and finally to Leyhill in Gloucestershire. “After a couple of years I realised I was falling in love and George told me he felt the same. “When he got to Leyhill he was allowed occasional phone calls and it was quite easy for him to sneak out. We could meet at night and be romantic.”Val even took her daughter Marion along on visits and George would give her bars of chocolate and toys he had made himself. She added: “By then I couldn’t really  imagine my le without George.“He was recommended twice for parole and turned down by the Home Office but I grew determined to win his release and I wrote to more and more people. “I became George’s leline and his window to the outside world.“Fast-forward to  and his release from prison and our wedding were the two happiest days of my le.“We got married at Bath register office and everyone I taught with at the school turned up.” To start a new le, the couple bought a derelict house in Co Kerry in Ireland, spent years renovating it and eventually moved out there full-time. Val added: “We rarely spoke about what happened and we burned all of our letters along with the manuscript from the trial. It felt cathartic.”  Sadly when George was  he was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis. Val left their home because it held too many memories but went back to scatter George’s ashes and film for the BBC’s Murder, Mystery and My Family.The show tells George’s story, with QCs Sasha Wass and Jeremy Dein examining all the facts relating to the case. Val added: “Losing George left a big hole in my le. I spent  years fightinghis corner and it has been very, very hard to readjust.” Murder, Mystery and My Family is on BBC One, weekdays at .am."},{"url":null,"title":"viking sky stricken cruise ship","story":"NewsViking Sky: Stricken cruise ship being towed to shore after three engines restartSixteen people were hospitalised after the Viking Ocean Cruises vessel became stuck off the coast of Hustadvika, west NorwayShareCommentsByAine FoxBradley JollyDave Burke:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video passengers-stranded-norwegian-cruise-ship-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree of four engines on a stricken Norwegian cruise ship have been restarted.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields public need say","story":"NewsBob Shields: Public need say on Prime Ministers Brexit dealReal democracy is having a second voteShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsBlundering Theresa May heads the most incompetent Government weve had in living memory \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHow many Members of Parliament does it take to change a light bulb  The answer – of course - is just one. But it takes the other  of them over two and a half years to decide exactly what kind of light bulb they want in its place! In last week’s episode of Commons Comedy Capers, we had the Brexit secretary proposing the Government’s motion . . . then voting against it. Similarly, we had the Chief Whip – whose job is make sure MPs toe the party line – voting against his party line! Last Tuesday MPs rejected Theresa May’s deal, on Wednesday the rejected ‘No Deal’ and on Thursday they rejected sticking to the March  deadline. I watched the creaking, croaking Theresa at Prime Minister’s Questions and it looked like the only thing you could guarantee to be behind May . . . was June! When it comes to Brexit, the House of Commons has now had more votes than most Eurovision Song Contests. And as I write this on a dreary Monday afternoon – it seems certain that another vote is on the way. Theresa May is going to put her ‘deal’ to the Commons for a THIRD time . . . but onlyshe’s confident that she’ll win it! Yes folks – a vote ONLYshe knows she’ll win in advance. How’s that for democracy at work  So - we have a vote . . . another vote . . . and then another vote  Mmm – now where have I heard that before  Ah yes – now I remember - it’s been the Conservative party’s official ‘put down’ of every single request for a second “people’s referendum” on Brexit. It’s a line you can even trace it back to the lips of our very own Member of Parliament, Mr Bill Grant. “We have already had a ‘people’s vote”, he said. “Another vote, assuming it indicated a dferent outcome, would be presumably followed by another vote and another vote, and so on”. What Bill, and the Conservatives, have been telling us for months is that you can’t keep on having a vote until you get the result you want. But meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative party is doing exactly that! And it’s not asthe Prime Minister needs a five per cent swing – the dference in the Euro referendum – to get her own way. It beggars belief that she can take the biggest parliamentary hiding in history . . .and go back for a second and even a third bite at the cherry! It begs the obvious question –our MPs can get three chances to vote on the biggest political issue of our generation – why can’t the ‘people’ get at least a second vote  I’m also getting fed up with Brexiteers telling us “the public just want this pushed over theline so they can move on”.Er . . . no. The public I speak to want the right deal to leave Europe. Andit’s not on the table, theywant the right to reject it and stay in Europe. Is it too late to ask Bill Grant to stop puckering in the direction of Theresa May and start pointing his ears in the direction of his constituency, which not only voted to “remain” but voted him to Parliament to represent them  I hope not. Bill’s qualities might include loyalty . . . but he’s always open minded. My solution  Well, it might be a bit simplistic – but then most solutions are.  Parliament instructs the PM to ask to delay Article  for one year.  Parliament instructs the PM to form a cross-party Brexit Committee to begin new talks – and come back with the best deal that the combined parties have negotiated and will have support in Parliament.  Give the public an unbiased and detailed explanation of what the deal means. Put it to a referendum – accept the deal and leave – or reject the deal and remain. This way, the people of Britain - and Europe - will know exactly where they stand.By March   – we’re in or we’re out. And everyone, on every side, will have had their say. Bill, that’s real democracy at work.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnConservative PartyAyrBrexit"},{"url":null,"title":"gran who hurled bleach over","story":"Picture by contracted freelance Steve McKendrick\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA gran who hurled bleach over a child has been granted a personal licence to sell alcohol by East Ayrshire council. Mary McLelland was convicted of throwing the cleaning agent over a -year-old boy’s head and body in Auchinleck. Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"people say future high rise","story":"NewsPeople to have their say on the future of high-rise flats in AyrTenants asked for their preferred optionShareByGary Fanning:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTenants in the Riverside Place multi-storey flats in Ayr are getting the chance to have their say on the future of the high-rise properties as South Ayrshire Council’s consultation on ‘Your place, your future’ gets underway. The consultation and engagement exercise – approved by Councillors last year – gives tenants the chance to choose their preferred option for the long-term future of the flats: Refurbish  – this means the Council would keep the flats, decant tenants, carry out identied refurbishment works, and thentenants to their refurbished flats. Rehouse  – this means tenants would be rehoused permanently in suitable alternative accommodation and the flats would be demolished. Rebuild  – this means tenants would be decanted to temporary accommodation and the flats would be demolished before some tenantsto a new-build housing development on the Riverside Place site. The detailed consultation, which is based around inidual one-to-one meetings with more than  tenants, has been planned in conjunction with the River Ayr Tenants Association, which represents tenants in the three blocks. The Council has communicated regularly with tenants in the lead-up to the consultation to ensure they have all the information they need to take part. A further letter has now been distributed to homes in Riverside Place following queries and concerns raised by tenants regarding a letter sent to them by Fort, Seafield  Wallacetown Community Council. The community council’s letter appears to query the three consultation options being discussed with tenants and questions South Ayrshire Council’s interpretation of the expert report approved last year regarding the “essential and advisable” works required to the flats. Councillor Philip Saxton, South Ayrshire Council’s Portfolio Holder for Housing and Community Wellbeing, said: “We are committed to ensuring that our tenants are fully involved in the discussions about the future of their flats, which is why we’re taking such a detailed approach to this consultation. “It’s vital that tenants understand all the facts so they can form their own views about the option that is best for them. That is why we have gone back out to them to respond to the queries and confusion that have been generated by the community council’s letter. “We fully appreciate that the community council may have a view on the consultation, which is why colleagues are meeting with them next week and we’re happy to keep them informed about the consultation and engagement process. “However, our focus – which was clearly expressed by tenants at the recent River Ayr Tenants Association meeting – has to be on hearing the views of those who will be directly affected by Councillors’ decisions later this year: the tenants of Riverside Place. “We thank them for their participation in the consultation and I can reassure them that their views will be taken into account before any decisions are taken about the future of Riverside Place.” Joe Lafferty, Chair of the River Ayr Tenants Association, said: “We have worked closely with the Council over the last couple of years as discussions around the future of the flats have moved forward – and we very much appreciate the approach the Council has taken. “It is for every tenant to consider what is the best option for them and to ensure their voice is heard by those who will be making the decisions about what happens next. Clear facts, easy to understand information and answers to the questions tenants have is what’s needed and that’s exactly what we have got from the Council.”   Feedback from the consultation will be considered by Councillors in June this year.Full details of the Riverside Place consultation are available at  www.south-ayrshire.gov.uk riverside-place .

The Post can exclusively reveal that the developers McCarthy  Stone have thrown in the towel and withdrawn their multi-million pound proposals. Major question marks hang over the building’s future following the bombshell announcement. The news prompted an angry backlash from Derek Hart, chair of Prestwick North Community Council. In an extraordinary outburst he claimed the building has been “plundered and left to rot.” The building provided a retreat for children battling cancer for more than  years. It was opened by Princess Diana in . In  it was sold by owners Clic Sargent after claims of a “challenging fundraising environment”. They sold it to McCarthy  Stone and trousered £.m from the deal. However, since McCarthy  Stone took ownership and unveiled their luxury flat plans they have been embroiled in a bitter fight with neighbours Prestwick Golf Club. The club was opposed to the development on the basis of its scale and design. Other objections included the potential impact it would have had on their historic course and the surrounding conservation area. In addition, there were fears that errant balls could smash into residents’ properties. Plans involved building  flats for people aged over , spread out in a T-shape over four floors. Many would have had sea views and balconies. The proposals were approved by South Ayrshire Council but last year Prestwick Golf Club successfully petitioned for a judicial review, meaning demolition work on the former retreat had to stop. It was estimated that  jobs would be created between the construction phase and posts at the new development. Despite a PR charm offensive from McCarthy  Stone throughout the process and a public exhibition of plans at the  Club in Prestwick’s Main Street, the developers pulled the plug on the project. A spokesperson said: “Following a strategic review last year we are no longer pursuing any new developments within Scotland and have withdrawn our plans for Prestwick.” Derek Hart reckons the decision is a kick in the teeth for all the campaigners who fought to retain the presence of a sick children’s home in Prestwick. He told the Post: “I find this action taken by McCarthy  Stone not only deplorable but a slap in the face to the Save Malcolm Sargent House team who fought bravely to try to purchase it. “Is it not time for South Ayrshire Council to stop and listen to the community  “The community stated that the development would only feather the nests of McCarthy  Stone – and perhaps chemists –as the age group targeted by them were over  years. “There’s been very little input to Prestwick and we are now left with a building that has been plundered and left to rot. “Will we find the same response to the other end of the beach, at the old Gym, I wonder ”He added: “Time after time SAC have allowed developers to build as they wish with barely a challenge to the character ofthe town and how it should look.”The news will be viewed as a major victory for Prestwick Golf Club, who fought long and hard against the development. A statement by the club said: “While we welcome this news we hope that, should a new development proposal for the site be put forward in the future, the design and scale will be more sympathetic to the surrounding area.” The statement said the club was not against the principle of redeveloping the site but was “disappointed” at the scale and design of the proposed development. It added: “We believed that McCarthy  Stone hadn’t listened to the concerns raised by the club.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrincess DianaSouth Ayrshire CouncilRoyal FamilyPrestwickAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club. Her loving older sisters Gillian McBlane, , and -year-old Gaenor Hardy have just pounded round the Stroke Association’s Resolution Run with Gillian’s -year-old son Graham to continue raising money for the charity. That added £ to a total now of about £. Gillian, a top civil lawyer in Ayr, and Gaenor, headmistress at Heathfield Primary, assist their parents Jean and Ian who are Fiona’s full-time carers. And Gillian is helped by the other legal eagle in the family, Ayr criminal defence agent Steven Maxwell. Gillian said: “She loved her work and was a real high flier. “People were drawn to Fiona’s fun-loving nature and her great big heart. “Never for a minute did we think she would have a stroke. “At  years old she had lost everything she loved.” Fiona is prone to falling and choking, often passing out. Sometimes the enormity of what has happened becomes too much for her and she struggles emotionally. But Gillian said: “Our parents taught us to look for the positive things in le and not to feel sorry for ourselves. We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t . They keep in contact with her and visit when they can. “People have shown us great kindness over the years in so many ways and this means a lot, helping us immensely. We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"blazin-night-of-fiddle-music-in-melrose","story":"FIDDLE fans in Melrose were recently treated to an award-winning Scottish band perform earlier this monthContemporary Scottish fiddle band Blazinrsquo Fiddles entertained a big crowd at the Corn Exchange hosted by Live Borders.A spokesperson told us: ldquoBlazinrsquo Fiddles are one of the worldrsquos most prolic fiddle groups.ldquoNo other band has quite managed to capture the excitement, sensitivity and raw fire of Scottish music all at once.ldquoOne of todayrsquos foremost Scottish folk acts, Blazinrsquo Fiddles combine over  yearsrsquo experience with ever-renewed musical appetite, vitality and sophistication.Blazinrsquo Fiddles are currently celebrating their st year of touring and recording and show no signs of slowing down.

Craig Galbraith worked well playing with, eventual man of the match, Calum Johnson for the first time.In the th minute there was a skirmish in the box after a corner, Johnson cleared the ball but it ricocheted off the incoming player into the net.The Glasgow students had more possession with the wind advantage. With  minutes left, a tremendous fingertip save, by Neil McMillan, pushed the ball over the bar.With four minutes left the away side put the game beyond #Dale#s reach when Matthew Lamont tried to clear a corner shot but unforunately scored an own goal.In high winds and driving rain the game fizzled out.Both sides had played well in the conditions and kept the ball on the deck in addition, referee, Archie Mitchell said it was an easy game to ref with no bad tackles.The match ball was sponsored by Wee Toon Sports and a Carradale spokesperson thanked Food for Thought for the post match hospitality.Tomorrow Carradale travels to Helensburgh for an early kick off at noon."},{"url":null,"title":"machrihanish bay is britains second best beach","story":"The bay, which is the beginning of the longest continuous stretch of sand in Argyll, extending all the way to Westport, was second only to Sandown Bay on the Isle of White in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards .After a long and detailed judging process to determine the shortlist for each category, the magazine#s readers and website visitors were given a month to vote for their favourites, with winners announced last week.The magazine#s editor, Fergus Collins, said: #Congratulations to each of the winners – and all the people and places who were shortlisted.#The aim of our awards is to celebrate the best of the British countryside and shine a light on lesser known places, projects and people who are doing great work.#Westport beach looking towards Machrihanish Bay. _cwestport"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 15 2019","story":"Peter Docherty, born and brought up in the Wee Toon, lives in a first floor flat, in Tangy Place tenement, at the end of the High Street, with a #marvellous# view of all the comings and goings on Campbeltown Loch.Back in , aged , he was an apprentice painter and decorator for a town firm, which he thinks might have been Galbraith and Cochrane.Mr Docherty#s son, also Peter, , talked to the Courier on Monday and said: #Dad told me that the young apprentices were always given the awkward, high up places to paint.#Back then this wall must have been under a ceiling as now the graffiti chipped into the plaster is at waist height.#Painters always used to leave their mark on a building, many will be painted over in people#s houses.#They often wonderedtheir #marks# would be uncovered in the future.#On this wall they could see the names of people who had painted it in the past.#When he saw Down Memory Lane last week dad said he was the only P Docherty in the town at the time.#Peter junior, who visits two to three times a year, said: #I was born in Craigard.

proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

Restaurant review by Ron MackennaNominally a ldquoside dish at a mere pound., this intelligently composed winter salad of bitter chicory, peppery rocket, and walnuts that taste freshly toasted, all tossed in a Stilton vinaigrette, is just what I fancy. We marvel at the ldquosmall plate of mussels. Its pound. tag is deceptive. Itrsquos enough for lunch, an ample bowlful of bivalves, plump, fleshy specimens, in a thick Asian soup thatrsquos not for wimps, a thicker version of Indian rasam, aromatic with lime leaf, cinnamon bark, cloves, star anise, and just a hint of sweetness to round it off. Therersquos also a blisteringly hot flatbread to dunk into it. It tears away in circular strands, a bit like a Malaysian roti cenai. Heaps of effort is packed into this dish, yet itrsquos inexpensive.Hake, a special on todayrsquos menu, is a pleasure to behold, a steak cut from the centre of a well-proportioned specimen impeccably grilled under its cape of green herbs. Wild garlic scent wafts up from the plate. It twines around roasted slices of purple potato, which have that rewarding, elusive flavour and floury texture thatrsquos now such a rarity because these characteristics have been bred out of modern ldquomultipurpose commercial potato ieties. Squash pureacutee adds a brightening dash of orange to the opalescence of the fish, setting off the emerald garlic leaves, and the muted imperial purple of the potatoes.The fishcake is also made with hake, and once again, we taste Stravaiginrsquos very evident proficiency with the use of spice. Its innards have the hue of brown crab meat, I guess from a fresh-made curry paste, which lends sharp backbone, perhaps from tomato, with the earthy undertow of turmeric. The necessary oiliness of its breadcrumb jacket is offset by juicy ribs of crunchy, refreshing pak choi that have had a fleeting visit to a searingly hot wok. A runny-yolked poached egg, and satiny, coriander-speckled Hollandaise layer, add wanton enrichment to the already satisfying fish.We catch up with the plum frangipane tart in a just-out-the-oven state. Its thick, yet barely cooked centre, rather like liquid marzipan with opulent dark plums bleeding into it, is only just bound by a taut corset of gloriously buttery, almost butterscotch pastry. This paragon of patisserie perfection is partnered beautully by a scoop of toasted almond ice cream, which tastes like essence of the very best Spanish nougat. Apple and olive oil cake from the daily menu hits that bliss point between too hot to eat and freshly baked. Moist within from the oil, and subtly conveying all the grassy, green flavours in it, it really does taste ine. The exterior is an up hill and down dale landscape of biscuity crust and apple chunks. Translucent pools of sharp, punchy green apple compote, and amber caramel, accentuate the winning sweet-sourness of the cake, while lemony cregraveme fraiche ice cream decisively nudges this dessert away from excessive cloyingness.In its own words, Stravaigin has been ldquowandering since  and ldquoshowcasing Scottish produce that isnrsquot tethered to its roots.

Wersquove had enough of that from Theresa May. The can has been kicked down the road so often that you just want to jump on it and flatten the damned thing.This week we go back to the bargaining stage, but we may not even get that. Parliament has been given an extra fortnight for May to preicate, and for the Commons to avoid coming to a consensus.At least the prospect of no deal on Friday might have concentrated minds, like an execution, and forced MPs to seize the reins of power from this battered and friendless Prime Minister.Instead, we have another fortnight to learn what we already know: that MV seems as remote as ever, and Theresa May wonrsquot give up on it.The European Unionrsquos political leaders were, of course, acting in their own best interests on Thursday. Having listened to May ramble on incoherently for  minutes, the  concluded that, yes, she really is daft enough to let a no-deal Brexit happen.Well, they can live with thatthey have to. But what they werenrsquot prepared to do is allow her to blame the European Union for the breakdown so, to coin a phrase, they took back control.The heads of government offered to delay the Brexit deadline until May ,she gets her deal through Parliament, or April she doesnrsquot. They will go the extra mile, explore all options, and then even offer a longer extensionall  fails. Itrsquos jaw-jaw not war-war, and they are the virtuosos of jaw-jaw.Though in truth, Brussels doesnrsquot really know what happens when the talking finally ends.The problem with the European Union is that they expect political leaders to behave as rational agents, who seek the most advantageous outcome. They donrsquot have protocols to deal with mad-as-a-hatter prime ministers and a parliament that has lost the plot.The UK has decided to have a collective mental breakdown, in full technicolour, and will not be talked out of it by boring bureaucrats with their seemingly sensible solutions.After , days, the simple fact is that UK still doesnrsquot know what Brexit means. That image of the cat manically scratching at the door, and then refusing to leave when itrsquos opened, is only too apt.Everyone knows that the obvious destination for a country like Britain, which has vital trading links with Europe but doesnrsquot want to be part of the political union, is to join the European Economic Area, now dubbed ldquoCommon Market ..That alone allows friction-free trade, avoids an Irish border and halts these daft, wartime preparations for no deal. .There has always been a majority in Parliament for soft Brexit, everyone says so. But as I pointed out last week, our system seems incapable of distilling compromise from the mash of party interests.MPs say they want to reach across party boundaries, but as last weekrsquos walkouts and tetchy letters confirmed, they donrsquot really. No-one wants to take any responsibility, no one wants to blink first, no-one wants to make the first step.Yet to halt Theresa Mayrsquos Thelma and Louise-style drive to the clf edge, ministers and MPs will have to remove her from office, probably through a confidence motion, and set up a kind of provisional government.They need to force the long delay she refuses to contemplate. This weekrsquos indicative votes on their own wonrsquot cut it. The nightmare, indeed, is that nothing gets a majority.The Westminster system requires a semi-dictatorial Prime Minister, with an unassailable majority, to . But May is a dictator without an army. She has no majority, yet perversely behaves asshe still has one.What residue of authority she possessed evaporated after her petulant outburst against MPs on Wednesday. Even Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for her deal, like Lisa Nandy, were so outraged that they resolved to vote against her come what may.What can you do with a Prime Minister who wilfully alienates her potential allies Theresa May actually had a point about Parliament only being able to agree on what it doesnrsquot want. We all thought that the problem was the Withdrawal Agreement, the -page legal document signed off by May last year, which contained the infamous Irish backstop. But we now know that this is not the case.Last week, Labour declared that they did not have any problems with the Withdrawal Agreement or the backstop, despite Jeremy Corbyn having condemned it in November. He said then that Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement was ldquoa half-baked deal which Britain cannot leave, and the backstop would deny Britain ldquothe sovereign right of any UK parliament to unilaterally withdraw from any backstop.All Labour now wants is a tweak to the Political Declaration ndash that non-binding, non-legal compendium of cliches, aspiration and wishful thinking that accompanied the Withdrawal Agreement. I seem to remember writing that to say this was woolly would be an insult to sheep. So why has it become a deal-breaker The blame obviously lies principally with the Prime Minister ndash a woman so bereft of vision and leadership ability that she shouldnrsquot be left in charge of a milk float, let alone a country.She could have offered Labour anything they wanted: full consultation, customs union, workers rights, environmental standards, regulatory alignment. It would have meant little because the Political Declaration is non-binding. Instead, she has made a fetish of inflexibility which is the worst failing in a political leader. She is in love with her idea of herself as a ldquobloody dficult woman, and thinks that backing down, resiling, is a betrayal of her sex.That is why I ended up voting for the petition to Revoke Article . To my horror, I found myself agreeing with Nigel Farage and Michael Portillo that the only real choice,Parliament cannot act, is between no deal and no Brexit.The only certain way to end this horror show is to pull the plug, halt the madness and pretend the last three years never happened. EvenParliament does end up backing Mayrsquos deal, which of course is still possible, it wonrsquot put an end to this nightmare.The Withdrawal Agreement is only the start. It deals with citizenship, the orce bill and the Irish backstop. Negotiations over Britainrsquos future trading relations with the EU have yet to begin, and will take two to four years. Four more years of this would be beyond endurance.And it wonrsquot be Theresa May who is doing the negotiating, but perhaps Boris Johnson, or some other Tory leader. If voters were fully aware of this fact, Irsquom sure that the parliamentary petition calling for Article  to be revoked would top  million within the week."},{"url":null,"title":"how-orkney-reinvented-the-future-with-hydrogen","story":"ldquoIn , it said, ldquoOrkney was the first to generate hydrogen from tidal power, using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.

Itrsquos also that for decades it struggled with the fact that it is an island, connected to the mainland electricity by an undersea cable, and suffers the worst fuel poverty in the UK ndash partially caused by being off the gas grid and stuck with one of the highest rates for grid electricity.Hydrogen technology has developed in Orkney, in part, because the islands had a problem.This archipelago with its now more than  wind turbines and developing tidal renewables was generating too much electricity for its own needs ndash it now produces the equivalent of % of its electricity demand ndash and wasnrsquot able to send more down the line to the grid.The cable connecting to the mainland could only carry a small fraction of what it was generating.Communities had erected wind turbines but were not seeing the expected revenue s, and were having their generation curtailed, some to just % of what they could generate. So great is the problem that currently there is a moratorium on further wind development.Clipsham says: ldquoThe huge expansion in renewable energy led to a point where there was more energy being produced than we could feed back through the cable to the mainland. That meant those who had invested in wind technologies were unable to get the revenue they were looking for.This was particularly frustrating, says Clipsham, because the sheer abundance of natural wind and tide resource on the islands meant ldquoyou could deploy  times, possibly more, of it than what wersquove currently deployed.Community groups had bought in to the idea of using the feed-in tarfs as a means of generating revenue for projects and services but werenrsquot seeing the expected payback. A further issue is that while Orkney is host to incredible renewables potential, the communities also suffer the worst fuel poverty in the UK. A factor in this is that there is no gas grid on Orkney and the electrical supply can cost as much as p per kWh, making it among the highest in the UK.The Orkney community was looking to find answers to these problems and, around seven years ago, EMEC began to look at using the renewables technology to make hydrogen by electrolysis. ldquoEMEC has always been very future-focused, says Jon Clipsham, ldquoand hydrogen is not new. Itrsquos been around for a long, long time. Iceland had a boom-and-bust cycle. But we began to look at it.ldquoThoughts of how we need to decarbonise the world were very present. By  , things had really some momentum and we decided to go for hydrogen.The first project was Surf rsquonrsquo Turf, a wind and tidal energy project that was all about grid balancing, in which energy was harvested when it couldnrsquot be put into the grid, stored, and regenerated as electricity when there was the opportunity to export it.However, it was quickly recognised that the hydrogen could also be used as a fuel. ldquoThe premise, says Clipsham, ldquoshted from grid balancing to setting us off on the journey which we are now well advanced with, towards having a fledged hydrogen economy.As part of EMECrsquos European Union and Scottish Government-funded Big Hit project, hydrogen heating boilers are being fitted in a school on the Orkney island of Shapinsay. Meanwhile, a car ferry is under construction which will run on hydrogen, and this year will see the installation of a hydrogen system into one of the ferries currently running between Shapinsay and Kirkwall.Such technological development seems timely. In December last year, Maersk, the worldrsquos largest container shipping company, announced it aimed to be carbon neutral by  ndash currently it is looking at biofuels.Clipsham is interested in how these hydrogen and renewables technologies might scale up or be adapted in dferent locations. ldquoCan the learnings we got here be transitioned  Yes. Energy systems are becoming increasingly decentralised, so yoursquore breaking things down into smaller chunks, so you might see some of the knowledge wersquove gained on Orkney rolled out and used on a block of flats, or a housing estate or a leisure centre.There is a sense on the island right now that what they are doing is being watched. Steven Bews, a builder who grew up on Shapinsay where the Big Hit project is based, is, as chair of Shapinsay Development Trust, involved in his community turbinersquos integration in the project. ldquoWe do feel a wee bit like the whole world is looking at us, he says. ldquoI keep seeing it on social media. Orkney and the Big Hit project is being highlighted and itrsquos good to see that the wider world is aware of us.For Bews, the idea that he is getting to be part of a greener future is as important as the local benefits. ldquoTherersquos a feeling that you are being environmentally friendly in what yoursquore doing. Yoursquore trying to lever the whole industry away from carbon and on to renewable green energy ndash and while it is in its infancy, I believe hydrogen has the potential to eventually replace a diesel and hydrocarbon-thirsty transport infrastructure.The awareness of climate change is strong on the islands. Almost everyone has some story to tell of its impact. Adele Lidderdale, hydrogen project officer at Orkney Islands Council, observes: ldquoYou see crop failure. We had flooding over the past  years that we didnrsquot previously see. We know the impact that the environment can have on day-to-day le.Lidderdale, whose great grandfather came from Orkney, grew up on the islands. Her husband grew up on Shapinsay, where one of the key hydrogen projects is based. ldquoWhen yoursquore in such a small community you see the impact first hand. You have to answer to the community. I think thatrsquos part of the unique mixture of why wersquore able to get these things done. You know that yoursquore going to have to answer to the people who are going to be affected by any decisions you make.Part of the appeal of the Orkney hydrogen project is that it shows on a small, very human scale, how hydrogen could become part of the answer in a low-carbon future. Nigel Holmes, chief executive of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association, sees great promise in what is happening on the islands.ldquoOrkney is almost like a microcosm of some of the things we are trying to tackle. We can show how we make the hydrogen from renewables, we can move it around, we can store it. We can show how it can be used in transport. We can show it can be used for making power, also for heating. The project helps people to appreciate the interconnected nature of some of these networks ndash because itrsquos all there in one place.Clipsham has watched the project develop and believes that one of the key things about the Orkney Islands is the people. ldquoPeople are starting to ask, lsquoWhy is all this going on in the Orkney Islands  Yoursquove got , people, but theyrsquove now got a portfolio of about  million euros of hydrogen related projects happening.rsquo And thatrsquos a very good question.ldquoBut when you go to the Orkney Islands and you talk to some of them, you realise why. Because there is such a positive can-do attitude. If you give them a problem they will work out what they can do to find a solution. Andit isnrsquot obvious theyrsquoll go out and look for it. There is an absolutely amazing attitude up there."},{"url":null,"title":"si-ferry-talks-football-in-our-latest-cool-conversations","story":"A le less ordinary: Partick Thistle director Jacqui Low talks politics, bereavement and smashing the glass ceilingIt helps that Ferry is a former footballer and that some of the people he interviews are just his mates, people he might chat with anyway.

Backed by funding from Scottish Natural Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the project will involve a ldquobee census and DNA testing to establish the sustainability of the remaining gene pool.The Trust said while the species was unlikely to disappear within a few years, it may have ldquojust decades left due to the tiny number of bees left in the harsh environment of the Highlands.One of  species of bumblebee in the UK, the distribution of the great yellow has declined by  per cent since , making it one of the rarest in the country.ldquoThey are very distinctive and very beautul.

In some cases they have their own bathrooms, while in others they have to share a communal one in the corridor. In one BB, residents were forbidden from talking to each other or going to each otherrsquos rooms, while in another the doors were locked at midnight and anyone not back by then would be out for the night.Cooking facilities were rare, and in most cases residents lived on non-perishables such as instant noodles, biscuits and junk food.For the money costs to be accommodate in these places ndash pound a month ndash an \"impressive drawing room conversion\" is advertised for rent in the heart of Glasgows west end.The flat in an \"elegant sandstone townhouse\" comes with a modern kitchen, mezzanine, \"stylish\" two-piece bathroom and separate toilet, and is \"exceptionally well-placed for local amenities and excellent transport links\".And for less than that, pound a month, a two-bedroom semi-detached mews is available for rent, including council tax bills.The \"elegant\" property is also in the west end of Glasgow, and boasts two large bedrooms, a kitchen, bathroom and access to a garden.In Bearsden, a three-bedroom refurbished villa is on the market for just pound a month.This, they say, is only adding to or creating more problems in terms of mental health issues, addiction, isolation and unemployment.Lorna Walker, a partner at Govan Law Centre, said: ldquoThis isnt the best use of taxpayers money, when they could be putting it in to accommodation that is of a decent standard and putting it in to helping people get their lives back on track the way they want it.\"It is not a good way for taxpayersrsquo money to be spent at all and the authorities need to open their eyes and see that.ldquoThe law in Scotland on this issue is some of the best ndash it is very clearly written, and it is clear how it should be applied.

But then itrsquos in Africa, isnrsquot it  These things happen there, have done before and doubtless will again, so whatrsquos new If I had the proverbial pound for every time such cynical responses have crossed my path after ing home from covering humanitarian crises across the African subcontinent and where these past decades, then the needy coffers of aid agencies would be better off right now.It was late on Thursday, March  when Cyclone Idai made landfall off the coast of Mozambique, before hurtling itrsquos gargantuan wrecking ball of mph winds, rain and floods into Zimbabwe and Malawi, causing devastation across swathes of all three countries.What Idai left in its wake has been described as perhaps the worst weather-related disaster ever to hit the southern hemisphere. Already the United Nations World Food Programmehas declared the flood crisis a level three emergency, putting it in the same bracket with Yemen, Syria and South Sudan.In terms of its impact for the estimated . million people caught up in this maelstrom, it meant storm surges of up to  feet deep, creating on the Mozambican coast what BBC reporter Fergal Keane flying over the area by helicopter called an ldquoinland sea.For tens of thousands it has meant being trapped by floods, landslides, flattened homes and flooded communities, with crops, roads and electricity supplies wiped away. More than , people needed emergency evacuation in the Mozambican port city of Beira alone where the cyclone made landfall. Some initial reports estimate that % of Beira, Mozambiquersquos fourth-largest city, with more than , residents, may be damaged or destroyed. Without electricity Beira has found itself in the dark and has become a ghost town at night.Many in Beira and where were stuck on rooftops or on tiny islands of land surrounded by water with no food, clean drinking water or shelter. There have been cases of women with babies trapped in trees and other lucky survivors pulled from neck-deep water.As ever in such situations, many of those worst affected were already the poorest of the poor, susceptible to hunger and disease even before Idai dealt them such another cruel blow.ldquoThis will have the worst impact on those most vulnerable, says Caroline Rose, Medecins Sans Frontieres head of mission in Mozambique.ldquoItrsquos those who have small, fragile houses that are worst impacted, as they are always the people without the means to build a new house. So itrsquos a vicious cycle.ldquoThose who have no means to rebuild will be left outside with no house, more at risk of disease and worse off.Aid organisations are of one voice in stressing that itrsquos now a race against the clock to prevent an even worse catastrophe emerging through the spread of disease.ldquoWe are running out of time, it is at a critical point here, warned the United Nations childrenrsquos agencychief Henrietta Fore on Friday.ldquoTherersquos stagnant water, itrsquos not draining, decomposing bodies, lack of good hygiene and sanitation, Fore said. ldquoWe are worried about cholera, about malaria, because of the stagnant water.As ever, humanitarians will have their work cut out harnessing the collective concern of a world that has so far been disproportionately low.As ever too, those cynics will chant their now familiar mantra about it being far away in Africa and how ldquocharity begins at home.To those among such people I would simply ask this. Imagine, just imagine, waking up tomorrow and the sense of desperation you would feel were your own children confronted with the same horrors so many in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi face right now How dferent the callous attitudes of such cynics might be were they, even momentarily, to eyewitness such suffering for themselves up close.The chaos, pain, helplessness, hunger and disease of such disasters are not an easy thing to confront face on and forget. The juxtaposition with the comparative safety and luxury so many of us take for granted here would also be a real shock to the sensibility of many.I well recall many years ago when the impact of climate change was dismissed more readily than it is now, ing from Ethiopia where millions were caught in the grip of drought and impending famine.It was just days before Christmas when I set foot back in Glasgow. The conspicuous consumption of that time of year stood in grotesque marked contrast to a village where I had been just a few days before, watching vultures circling above a community where people were already badly malnourished and some had died of hunger.ldquoWe call them the undertaker birds, one elderly local man told me, bringing home the terrible resignation so many people feel towards their fate when faced with such helplessness.Idairsquos angry arrival in Africa was yet another ominous sign for a continent already bearing the brunt of climate change. How tragically ironic it was that the cyclone made landfall on precisely the same day that the One Planet Summit, called by French president Emmanuel Macron, opened in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. In the same week too as Idai caused unimaginable levels of devastation, the Africa Climate Week conference got under way in Accra, Ghana.No doubt delegates at both conferences were again reminded that while Africa is responsible for only % of global greenhouse-gas emissions, climate change is considered to directly impact % of the African population.Those in any doubt that Africa is the continent that pays the highest price for this need only have tuned into breaking news reports of Idairsquos arrival to be reminded of what this means for millions of people.As environmental journalist Landry Ninteretse who leads the campaigning organisation Africa  has pointed out, for Africans ldquoclimate change is not a future risk, itrsquos already a reality evident in wrecked families, lands and livelihoods, and hopeless children and young people who have no choice but to seek a future by migrating.Perhaps those same cynics who complain about foreign aid and the ldquodeluge of migrants Europe faces should pause and consider this unrelenting impact of climate change. This, after all, is one of the prime reasons why so many of those plucked out of the seas or who drown trying to reach Europe are from the African subcontinent.Somewhere down the line you can be sure that Cyclone Idai and other disasters will send more on such perilous journeys.As Ninteretse says, Idai is just the latest reminder that everywhere on the African continent communities fear losing their land as each season hits one country after another with exceptional floods, unexpected storms and increasingly long droughts.It goes without saying thata tragedy of such gargantuan proportions as Idai occurred in the Western or ldquodeveloped world, then the response would be very dferent. Two vast cyclones named Trevor and Veronica are currently bearing down on the north coast of Australia and thousands have evacuated their homes in preparation for these two potentially devastating storms.Not for a moment to dismiss the suffering, destruction and potential loss of le these cyclones will bring to Australians, but itrsquos almost a certainty we will hear much more about their impact there than what has occurred in Africa this past week.Some will argue that it has always be thus, that there has been a huge disparity between how we handle humanitarian crises close to home or those that affect ldquorecognisable locations and how we process disasters that occur where.Butthere is one thing that the cycle of climate change and migration has shown us itrsquos that such humanitarian concerns are inextricably connected and transnational in nature affecting us all in one way or another wherever we might be.There are those who will argue that we cannot be sure that the likes of Idai was caused by climate change. But global experts agree that climate change certainly made it worse and point to three factors.First, warmer air temperatures mean more rain is held and then released. Idai produced nearly a yearrsquos worth of rain in just a few days, more than two feet in parts of the region.Second, the region has been suffering from sustained drought in recent years, itself a problem associated with climate change.As Unicef chief Henrietta Fore has pointed out, the water that has arrived has not drained. The hard, parched earth was unable to absorb water quickly, which has also increased the risk of flash flooding.Third, rising sea levels mean that storm surges such as those that engulfed the port city of Beira creating that ldquoinland sea are about a foot higher than a century ago having been fed by melting ice at the poles.ldquoCyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns, said Mami Mizutori, the UNrsquos special representative for disaster risk reduction.For the moment though, on the ground, current relief efforts in coping with Idai ldquoare nowhere near the scale and magnitude of the problem, according to Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.ldquoThe situation is simply horrendous. There is no other way to describe it, As Sy said after touring camps in Mozambique.ldquoThree thousand people who are living in a school that has  classrooms and six, only six, toilets. You can imagine how much we are sitting on a water and sanitation ticking bomb, he added, expressing the fear of many aid workers that disease is now the biggest threat.In neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi, meanwhile, the situation is also dire. In Zimbabwe, floods have affected an estimated , people, while in Malawi, , people are estimated displaced and , have been affected, according to the government.Across all three countries, many regions remain inaccessible and the death toll has now topped more than , but is almost certain to soar in the coming days.For aid agencies, access to potable drinking water, shelter, food, and healthcare are the priorities, they say, with water, sanitation and hygiene needs particularly urgent as the risk of waterborne diseases is the major concern across the board.ldquoIn Beira, we fear a huge cholera outbreak soon, said Caroline Rose of Medecins Sans Frontieres.ldquoThe main challenges will be getting treatment for people who donrsquot understand they have cholera, and that itrsquos urgent, or people who are not reachable, or people who cannot reach health centres, Rose confirmed.The arrival of Idai has once again brought home with devastating force issues and questions that affect us all.It has reminded us of the prevailing view among some that distant disasters are not our concern.Here in the UK, wersquove barely engaged with what has happened in Mozambique and its neighbours. As for those charity begins at home cynics, I know from long experience that their voices are those of the minority and by contrast the vast majority of ordinary people dig deep in their pockets and hearts when confronted by the suffering of their fellow human beings.Above all, Cyclone Idai has brought home again why we can no longer ignore the impact of climate change.In October , the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction released a report that highlighted the staggering financial impact of climate-related disasters.In the period  , disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses of , billion of which climate-related disasters accounted for ,bn or  % of the total.Itrsquos a staggering figure and no, itrsquos not just in Africa and where that such an impact will be felt. As those among our younger generation have admirably been highlighting for weeks now in their school protests across the world, climate change is something that affects every one of us.

Until now itrsquos been impossible to properly store and export green energy.The Scottish economist and scientist who head up the new HIAlba-Idea think tank say Scotland could effectively fuel the proposed European supergrid, and generate so much money for the economy that the nation could establish a Sovereign Wealth Fund, as Norway did with North Sea oil. The UK failed to set up such a fund.HIAlba-Idea, the first think tank based in the Highlands, is run by the economist Professor Ronald MacDonald, and the mathematician, scientist and engineer Dr Donald MacRae. MacDonald is professor of macroeconomics at Glasgow Universityrsquos Adam Smith Business School. He has been a consultant adviser to the European Central Bank, the European Commission, the World Bank, the IMF and the UK National Audit Office. MacRae has held under-secretary positions in the Australian government and was a director with Australiarsquos Commonwealth Scientic and Industrial Research Organisation .MacRaersquos work with CSIRO is key to the blueprints which the think tank is releasing tomorrow ndash called Hydrogen Scotland: A Route to Export Powerhouse and Maximising Scotlandrsquos Wellbeing While Bravely Innovating. Australia has started to use solar power to develop renewable hydrogen.Hydrogen can be produced using solar, wave or wind power, and can then be used as a cheap, clean, plentul energy source, and exported for the first time. Some have described the process as bottling sunshine and wind.The new technology is being hailed as the solution to many of the Westrsquos environmental, economic and social problems. MacDonald says the energy revolution would solve the ldquotail-off in productivity of the Scottish and UK economy, which came about with the sht from manufacturing to services.Renewable hydrogen is ldquothe big transformative idea, he says, which would ldquotake us back to being a manufacturing economy and an export power house. He added: ldquoThe revolution is having this cheap, storable and transportable energy. MacRae called it ldquoa game-changer.MacDonald believes renewable hydrogen could lead to a ldquoHighland renaissance as many of the wind farms needed to create the new energy source would be located in the most rural parts of the country.Renewable hydrogen ldquocould easily equal the whole production of North Sea oil in terms of its potential benefits to the UK and Scotland, said MacDonald. ldquoWe could set up a Sovereign Wealth Fund as the Norwegians have done.While Scotland ndash and Orkney in particular ndash are making good progress with the technology, Australia has already created a ldquoroadmap for commercial use of renewable hydrogen. South Korea plans to convert its ,-strong fleet of buses to hydrogen, and Australia is eyeing the market for exports. Japan is also moving toward the use of more hydrogen vehicles.HIAlba-Idea is calling on the Holyrood Government and the big players in the oil industry, who want to move away from carbons to green energy, to work with them to create a Scottish roadmap. Norway is also starting to explore the exploitation of renewable hydrogen.With Europe ldquodesperate for energy independence, says MacRae, Scotland would be well placed to export renewable hydrogen to the continent.MacDonald said: ldquoClearly, a Europe self-sufficient in green energy would have implications that go beyond decarbonisation, including that of its security, since it would no longer need to be reliant on potentially hostile countries for its energy supplies.MacRae added: ldquoYou can imagine an energy-independent Europe, through power generated by Scotland going into a supergrid.He proposes storing green energy ndash it would be kept as ammonia, from which the hydrogen is extracted ndash on decommissioned North Sea oil rigs among forests of floating wind farms.MacDonald and MacRae say thatthe new industry is handled properly by the Government, Scotland could also become a centre for manufacturing and exporting the equipment and technology associated with renewable hydrogen, as well as a global hub for the financial services needed to fund it.ldquoFor Scotland, said MacRae, ldquoit has the potential to be a very signicant game-changer. In fact, there are so many innovations that spin off it that we are actually looking at it as a whole portfolio of opportunities. For Scotland, we are talking about something of immense signicance.MacDonald added: ldquoThe exciting part is the transformative effect on society and the economy. This is a breakthrough which could transcend anything  we are doing, thatrsquos how important it is.He added that the impact on global warming would be ldquoenormous. ldquoScotland on its own being completely carbon-free would probably make some impact, but it would be quite small. Butthe supergrid became a reality then that in itself could be revolutionary. This could be the pathway to making the whole of Europe green. He feels it would not be long before green supergrids spread across the globe.If Scotland took a lead in renewable hydrogen, the global clout that came with that would be ldquophenomenal.The HIAlba-Idea vision is that Scotland becomes one of the largest global energy exporters in the world ... through the low-cost extraction of hydrogen from renewably generated ammonia used as a storage medium and carrier of hydrogen.The think tank says: ldquoOffshore ammonia production on disused oil rigs serving offshore wind farms could be stored for periods of low wind. In this way, the continuous production of renewable electricity is guaranteed.In its ldquo vision for energy, the Scottish Government did look at the role of hydrogen in the national energy mix. ldquoHowever, it neither envisions it as a major export industry nor considers the role of renewable ammonia in achieving this outcome, it notes.The renewable energy entrepreneur Eddie OrsquoConnor is advocating a single European energy market connected by a supergrid. ldquoAn interconnected energy market based on renewable energy linked by a supergrid will deliver cheap power to consumers and enable us all to meet our climate goals, he said.KELP, HEMP AND PLASTIC-EATING SHIPS: THE OTHER BIG IDEASFOR THE SCOTTISH ECONOMY IN THE ST CENTURYA GREEN energy revolution is just the biggest idea on the table when it comes to the future of the Scottish economy.Professor Ronald MacDonald and his colleague Dr Donald MacRae have some other revolutionary plans, including autonomous self-fuelled ships. These would clean up plastic in the oceans and turn the waste into a biofuel produced onboard. This would power the ships - and be pollution free.Seaweed could also be the crop of the future, with a growing market in the world for kelp, including vegan foods, beer, healthcare products, eco-friendly packaging and cosmetics.The use of off-shore rigs for the production of renewable hydrogen could also stimulate the seaweed industry. HIAlba-Idea suggests lsquooperating large-scale seaweed harvesting operations in conjunction with disused oil rigs and associated offshore wind farms established for offshore ammonia productionrsquo.lsquoSteel cables strung between wind turbine mountings and disused oil rigs [could] provide an ideal seaweed growing and harvesting zone.rsquoWith crofts working to run wind farms and the renewable hydrogen sector, farms would have the money to use lsquodrones and robotised farming practicesrsquo. Hemp - now seen as a superfood - could be grown on crofts and sold globally as hemp oil, hemp chocolate and hemp milk.If rural areas are able to grow in wealth, the University of the Highlands and Islands could establish mini-campuses in burgeoning communities - increasing the population and economy."},{"url":null,"title":"school-league-tables-comment-this-is-not-the-true-measure-of-our-schools","story":"Each year I get upset about them on behalf of all the headteachers and teachers across the city who work so hard to ensure that Glasgowrsquos young people achieve regardless of their background.As a maths teacher and former HM Inspector, I understand fully the limitations of drawing conclusions from just one statistic.

After reminding him he was born several years before the Beatles legend actually died, he became quite indignant ndash he was John Lennon. And I was an a******e. Only one of his claims could be provable in a court of law.As far as Irsquom aware, Stephen hasnrsquot yet managed to change the world with populisttunesmithery or incisive displays of laconic sarcasm. Irsquove no ideahe still adheres to his rather niche belief system either, but after learning that an ldquoOutlander: The Past Lives Experience exists in Inverness, Stephen struck me as the perfect target audience for such an outreacute business venture.Not only would he witness the stunning Highland locations that helped make the turgid Outlander much less torturous, but ldquohypnotist guide Diane Nicolson could also, assumedly, help Stephen clary his adolescent suspicions.Cannily incorporating past-le regression into Culloden walking tours, Diane and husband Andrew claim the TV seriesrsquo fans can now ldquoexplore potential past-le connections with Scotland and their soul-mate connections. As, eh, outlandish as this sounds, the Outlander: Past Lives Experience is extremely popular ndash especially among American tourists wishing to explore their Scottish lsquoheritagersquo -and this walking tourrsquosgenuinely unique selling point will no doubt soon be cloned by countless copycatventures aiming to monetisehope and naivety.Prudent minds will have already concluded thisinspired mash-up of battlefield tours and past le regression heraldsa potentially lucrative new tax revenue stream for Scotland, a country with unlimited potential for such unholy hybrids,strewn withsomber sites of historic horror.So instead of proudly boasting about our illustrious past to tourists, convincingthem they were actually part of it too might serve tosecure ourfuture economic prosperity and have reincarnation proudlyrankingalongside oil, whisky and salmon in the next SNP White Paper. Especiallywe tax Diane and Andrew for all their past lives too.Like most successful entrepreneurs, the couplersquos ambitions were fuelled by personal passion. Diane is convinced she was a th-century Jacobite warrior ndash coincidentally, of course, cut from a very similar gib as popular Outlander character Jamie Fraser. Diane also believes she and hubby Andrew were married in a past le ndash the only dference being he was a woman then.Any concerns over the lack of an appropriately mystical gender sign on public toilets for Andrew fade with one glimpse at the big fella, confirming therersquos little of his former self left. Hulking head to toe in full shortbread tin Jacobite garb, a wee theatrical scowl peeks out behind an explosion of facial hair. Yoursquod imagine any passing Yoons risk his wee plastic sword being waved at them.Was Max mad SCIENTIST Max Planck, much-lauded midwe to the wild weirdness of quantum physics, believed consciousness was the universersquos fundamental element and that all matter derived from it.The rough gist of his musings certainly foreshadowed the mathematical swoon of string theory, which poetically describes all matter being formed by the musical vibrations of minuscule ldquostrings. These canrsquot be bought at Victor Morris ndash rather, they are the ldquoguts of quarks and leptons, the fundamental building blocks at the root of everything our eyes can perceive.If our bodies are simply just the music of our minds, then it must mean we once had an ldquoessence in the ether, waiting billions of years for evolution so we could invent money, religionand crippling social hierarchies. More importantly, it would also mean that consciousness is not dependent on a brain.This notion sparked the interest of another respected scientist ndash the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan, who caused shockwaves among his peers by suggesting children claiming to be reincarnated deserved further study in his magisterial book The Demon-Haunted World.Dedicating  years of hisle to such endeavour at the University of Virginia is Dr James Tucker. Despite compiling more than , cases on the subject of reincarnation, however, Tucker is still not % sold ndash simply describing his work as ldquoquite compelling.Plastic pollutionONE of Dr Tuckerrsquos highest-profile studies was that of wee James Leininger from Louisiana, a three-year-old who seemed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after recalling details of his fiery death as a Second World War pilot.Although a potential ldquomatch was found, it was later revealed that the lad had been obsessed with toy aircraft ndash and, vitally, the plane he remembered was not actually on the victimrsquos aircraft carrier. Proving, perhaps, that plastic depictions of weaponry can be more a threat to the developing minds of children than iPads.If wee Jamesrsquos imaginative story had checked out, however, would this then prove reincarnation  Well, researchers would likely have never considered the possibility James may have travelled back in time and watched the crash for himself. Or that the ghost of the pilot materialised in his bedroom to bore him with his le story. Mibbie the wee man had the information implanted in his head during an alien abduction or even left his body and astral travelled to chat with the pilot in Heaven.Such unlikely scenarios are certainly no less credible than the notion we have an eternal soul that quantum leaps through a neverending supply of bodies. Yet, somehow, reincarnation manages to retain a validity that other bizarre supernatural explanations just lack.Other than wishful thinking, itrsquos dficult to see why. The evidence for reincarnation simply cannot hold up to any objective scrutiny. Hypnotism, for example, is certainly not a valid process of obtaining information. It is a highly subjective rummage around the subconscious thatrsquos capable of sparking  memories and mental illness.Similarly, accounts from children cannot be taken as proof. Not only because of the subjective nature of memory but because of positive reinforcement by researchers ndash who more often than not are already believers. Physical quirks such as odd birthmarks are also easily accounted for by natural explanations. Like Columbo said, many pieces of bad evidence do not equal one piece of good.Perhaps itrsquos best we never prove reincarnation, however. Certainly, you wouldnrsquot live long enough to finish an autobiography. No doubt it would also prove lucrative for ancestory, who might be able to track what types of dinosaur we once were. Yet, itrsquos also inevitable the Government would begin mass soul profiling ndash holding us all accountable for past misdemeanours.On a positive note, itrsquos also possible we could inherit great fortunes procured in former lives.You canrsquot take it with you, but perhaps the wealthy elite would choose to fly en masse to Dignitas, their eternal souls chilling out in the afterlersquos executive lounge as their Earthly riches accumulate vast interest. Yes, even death might not stop the rich getting richer.And finally ...THE First Law of Thermodynamics states any energy in the universe cannot be created or destroyed, but simply changes form. To believers in reincarnation, this proves we were all once amoebas, dinosaurs or, perhaps, gaseous blobs floating in acidic clouds on distant planets.All highly unlikely, of course, but scientists do not always dismiss the notion of a separate mind and body out of hand. Planckrsquos theory that consciousness came before the visible universe might initially seem supportive of true believers, but proves problematic under closer scrutiny.Although Planck suggests we are simply part of a single eternal energy source that has since splintered into all biological matter, he leaves the possibility ndash strap yourself in ndash that this ldquoGod has actually not fragmented.Perhaps, free from the constraints of spacetime, this consciousness can fully inhabit every single creature in the universe at the same time, simultaneously experiencing all possible perceptions of its wondrous creation.Andjust one ldquosoul exists, it also means Stephen really was John Lennon. And so was I. And you. Yet, ultimately, were all God. As Lennon himself once sang, ldquoI am you and you are me and we are all together.

However, Prospect has indicated that this would not be its members’ preferred option and it does not believe it would address their underlying pay issues.“As it stands the claim from the trade union remains a minimum of a double-digit increase effective from April , . A report compiled jointly between HIAL and Prospect on air traffic controller pay at non-HIAL airports found no evidence of a signicant pay dferential with other comparable airports.“At this point, it has not been possible to reach an agreement with the trade union on their pay dispute. Therefore, HIAL and Prospect have agreed to refer the matter to ACAS in a bid to resolve the matter.”However, David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer replied: #Members demands are reasonable and they need to be addressed. They are not seeking parity with Heathrow or Gatwick but other smaller airports.#“They have received a decade of below inflation pay rises while the rest of the industry, in response to a global shortage of controllers, has moved ahead. The company already struggles to recruit controllers and this is having an impact on services at some airports.“By asking for support from ACAS we hope to find a way forward in these talks. However ministers’ instructions to HIAL severely limit the companies negotiating position, so we also need to see these revoked.”As it stands, controllers at seven of HIAL’s eleven sites, including Kirkwall Airport, are due to take strike action on Friday, April .Industrial action short of a strike was also likely to start in April and continue through until August, and include instruction to work to rosters, refusal of non-medical extensions, an overtime ban, and withdrawal of goodwill.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Representatives from the commission are due to come to Orkney next month to discuss the proposals.Speaking yesterday, Ronnie Hinds, chairman of the commission, said: “We are pleased to begin our consultation on electoral arrangements with the three councils today and I look forward to engaging with them on our proposals.#It is important that electoral arrangements for Scottish councils are effective and that our proposals deliver on requirements for electoral parity and, as far as possible, take account of local ties and special geographical considerations.“We also welcome the flexibility offered by the IslandsAct to use one or two member wards and have used this flexibility as appropriate in our proposals. After completion of our consultation with councils we will be seeking public views on our proposals over the summer.”The  Review of Electoral Arrangements will make proposals for the six council areas specied in the IslandsAct  – Argyll and Bute, Highland, North Ayrshire, Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands.The commission is conducting the review in two phases, focusing firstly on Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands, with the reviews of  Argyll and Bute, Highland and North Ayrshire to take place after the public consultation in the islands groups takes place.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Those behind the charity said it is well-known that men find it harder to admit to problems and seek help at an early stage, but the camaraderie of the Men’s Shed is helping to overcome this resistance.Despite the success of Orkney Men’s Shed and the growing popularity of the movement across Scotland, Mr McArthur suggested that they remain a “largely unsung success story”.  The MSP described the work the organisation does as “le-changing” for its members, providing a sense of purpose and an opportunity to make friends and share company.Speaking after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “The Men’s Shed movement has been a tremendous success over recent years with the number of Sheds and ‘Shedders’ across the country continuing to grow. This is illustrated perfectly in Orkney, where the local Men’s Shed is going from strength to strength, with membership up to  and plans for expansion of the shed in Finstown.“Every Men’s Sheds is dferent, of course, but all provide a place to work and relax, pursue hobbies, share skills, have a cuppa and a chat and get practical help with projects. This should not disguise, however, the real impact Men’s Sheds can and do have. Increasingly it is recognised that these facilities make a tangible dference in efforts to tackle loneliness, social isolation and mental ill health.“Last month, I urged the government to look at the case for allowing Men’s Sheds to bid in for health and wider social care funding. This is the approach in Australia, where the movement started, and there are strong arguments for assessingthe same might be done in this country. This could help sustain and expand Men’s Sheds, providing more people in Scotland with the chance to access the many benefits they deliver”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A total of , out of , participants in the study had developed dementia by . A north south ide in Scotland in the quality of drinking water was also revealed, with the North East coming out worst and the Borders and South West coming out on top. Coagulants such as alumare used to trap impurities in raw water by binding them together to form particles before they are filtered out. Fluoride occurs naturally and is not added to the water supply in Scotland. Researchers say there is some evidence that it increases the human absorption of aluminium. Study author, Dr Tom Russ from the Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh, stressed that the low levels of aluminium and fluoride found in the water in Scotland were “very good” in relation to World Health Organisation guidelines. “Everybody included in the study was alive in  and they were all born in ,” he said. “Everybody who subsequently died with dementia was compared with those who died without, and the people who lived in areas of higher levels of aluminium in drinking water were more likely to die than those in areas where the aluminium levels were lower. “We still see this well accepted finding that higher levels of aluminium in particular are associated with an increased risk of dementia. It’s confirmatory rather than anything .”The study published in the British Journal Of Psychiatry, obtained water quality data from the Drinking Water Quality Regulator for Scotland for the years -. The DWQR is responsible for regulating public water supplied by Scottish Water, which was established in . Prior to this water quality was the responsibility of separate local authorities. A Scottish Water spokesperson said: “Scottish Water, like other UK water companies, operates in a highly regulated industry where public health is the prime concern and delivering high quality drinking water to customers across Scotland is a key priority for us.“We carried out over , tests in  at customer taps, our service reservoirs and treatment works to ensure customers receive consistently high quality drinking water and more than . per cent of tests at customer taps passed stringent quality standards.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"cargo lift for prestwick airport","story":"Glasgow Prestwick Airport has secured a new twice-weekly cargo service, expanding its freight operation.The deal will see CargoLogicAir operate Boeing  flights on a Monday and Friday connecting with Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport and Frankfurt Airport.Each service offers  tonnes of freight capacity providing a boost to Scotland’s oil and gas, aerospace and manufacturing sectors.Prestwick chief executive Stewart Adams said: “We’re extremely pleased to welcome CargoLogicAir as the airport’s latest freight operator.“With two weekly services carrying up to  tonnes, this is a tremendous addition to our extensive freight handling offering – a key part of the airport’s overall commercial strategy.“CargoLogicAir has ambitious expansion plans and utilising the services of Prestwick’s heavy-lt infrastructure, we’re excited to develop this partnership in support of its global operation.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit only two weeks to avoid an accidental no deal paris gourtsoyannis","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The UK#s Brexit fate is now in the hands of Remain-supporting Cabinet ministers and the other European Union member statesit is to avoid no deal, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.You wouldn’t normally base your political expectations on a chat in the pub. But when the guy propping up the bar is Theresa May’s top Europe advisor, Olly Robbins – the architect of her strategy in Brussels and the ERG’s favourite hate figure – you should safely be able to draw your Brexit roadmap from it.When ITV reported a second-hand overheard conversation in a Brussels bar where Robbins described how MPs would end up being presented with the option of May’s Brexit deal or a long delay, it seemed to offer a key that would unlock the whole process of leaving the EU.After MPs voted against no-deal last week and for an extension to Article , events appeared to be following Robbins’ script perfectly. The Government had hoped to bring the deal back for a third vote this week, with the threat of ­staying in the EU for anywhere between nine and  months looming over Brexiteers, forcing them to fall into line. Personally, I admit to breathing a sigh of relief at the end of last week’s chaos, thinking that a plan was coming together.But nothing has been more corrosive over the past three years than the illusion of government ­control, and some forces are beyond even Robbins’ reckoning. The fact that his plan was so dramatically derailed this week means that a no-deal Brexit – always the legal default – could now happen by ­accident, unless there is an even ­bigger twist in the week ahead.Rather than taking back control, the events of the past week put May’s fate in the hands of either the EU, or pro-EU Tories who could oust her to defeat her Brexit vision.: No-deal Brexit would place food banks in ‘dangerous position’, warns Ian BlackfordNo one in Government predicted John Bercow’s intervention ­ruling out a third vote on the Brexit deal unless there was a signicant change in content or circumstances. That in itself is worrying – the convention that motions can’t be voted on twice in the parliamentary session isn’t an obscure one. No one needs more evidence that Downing Street is floundering, but there it is.His critics say Bercow’s intervention was an attempt to block Brexit and allow the second EU referendum he really wants, or at least rule out a no-deal scenario. By ruling out a vote before yesterday’s EU Council summit, the ­Commons Speaker certainly denied the ­Government its best chance of ­getting the deal through.Bercow’s statement forced the EU Commission’s chief Brexit ­negotiator Michel Barnier to come out the following day and say a long extension needed a “clear purpose”. It also gave time for ­Brexiteers in the Cabinet to ambush May and force her to take a request for a long extension off the table.The spectre aimed at scaring Brexiteers was vanquished, ­leaving opposition MPs as the only pool of votes to pass the deal. May’s extraordinary statement in Downing Street, shting the blame onto parliament, burnt that bridge, too.With ious extension plans being discussed during intense talks in Brussels last night, EU leaders appear to have come to the conclusion that May, and her deal, are finished.If she isn’t in control, to avoid a no-deal Brexit the UK is now in the hands of two groups: Remainers in the Cabinet, and the  governments of the EU.A group of pro-EU Cabinet ­ministers have insisted they would do whatever it takes to stop no-deal. They may now have the time to show they mean it.Both Barnier and French president Emmanuel Macron have said there is a way back,the UK is ready for “deep political change”.This could be a general election or a second EU referendum, but what the EU really wants to hear is that the red lines that have made a deal so dficultare going to be jettisoned, either by May, or her successor.The Remain group in Cabinet includes Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who joined Amber Rudd, Greg Clarke and David Gauke in breaking a three-line whip to abstain on a motion to extend Article  last week. With so little time left, resignation isn’t enough. They would have to become the ‘men and women in grey suits’, insisting the Prime Minister abandons her red lines, or ushering her out of ­Downing Street.The likes of David Lidington would need to lead a government of national unity in all but name, getting a Brexit deal through with Labour and SNP votes that keeps the UK in the single market and customs union. It would likely mean the end of the Conservative Party as we know it at the very least, it would leave it to the next Tory leader to put its surviving pieces back together.: Jeremy Corbyn won’t rule out stopping Brexit as PM arrives in BrusselsEven in Brexit Britain, a week can’t possibly hold that much drama, but a longer extension offers the opportunity.Still, EU leaders can’t give the UK something it isn’t prepared to ask for itself. Conservative MPs lost the chance to push May from office when they failed to do the job before Christmas. The UK’s venerable ­parliamentary democracy has shown itself not to be nimble enough for the last-minute pivot needed, and evenit could, its leaders command too little confidence to bring the public along with them.In EU capitals, an election or a new EU referendum looks like a leap into more uncertainty, which the ­continent scarcely needs. Leaders and officials gathered in Brussels spoke openly about the “crisis” in the UK, and don’t want their fragile politics infected by the febrile mood around Westminster.A no deal Brexit could still happen by accident. The only thing that’s certain is that Bercow and the EU have called time on Robbins’ pub blueprint.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"euan mccolm history unmasks brexit fellow traveller corbyn","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Supporters of Jeremy Corbyn are hugely fond of making the claim that the Labour leader has always been on the right side of history.Whether defending him against troubling questions about his associations with representatives of sundry terrorist organisations or explaining why he could so often be found voting against past Labour governments, Corbynistas frequently rely on the line that their man has always had right on his side.This revisionist takemight baffle non-believers, but for those who have emotionally invested themselves in the Leader of the Opposition, it’s more than enough to allow them to maintain the fantasy that he is a paragon of moral purity.I wonder how many of those supporters will – after yesterday’s extraordinary march in London in support of a second EU referendum – have the decency to, at least, die a little inside the next time they parrot this claptrap about the man who would be prime minister.Corbyn’s boycott of yesterday’s protest is nothing less than a betrayal of the very people – the vulnerable, the poorly paid, the powerless – who will be hit hardest by the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union. What’s more, it’s a betrayal of his own party which – in theory, at least – is in favour of another referendum on EU membership as a way of breaking the deadlock on the question.Corbyn’s closest political ally, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, explained that the reason he could not bring himself to attend yesterday’s event was that by doing so he might “alienate” some of the people he wanted to “bring on board”. Maybe this was good enough for the faithful, but it really shouldn’t have been.On every political issue, there will always be those who take opposing views. If we apply McDonnell logic, those with whom a politician disagrees should never be challenged. Can you imagine a Corbynista arguing against protesting against, let’s say, restrictions on trade union rights on the grounds that to do so might alienate those who are in favour  No, of course you can’t.Across the broader left, arguments against participation in yesterday’s march were no less infantile.On Friday, Jonathon Shafi, co-counder of the Radical Independence Campaign, tweeted a list of participants in the march. These included Tories such as Michael Heseltine, Justine Greening and Dominic Grieve and Liberal Democrats Vince Cable and Jo Swinson. “How anyone on the left can countenance supporting this,” he wrote, “I have no idea.”One could easily draw up a list of those opposed to the objective of yesterday’s protest – Prime Minister Theresa May, for example, and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage – and ask how anyone on the left could countenance not participating in the march.The hard left – the Jeremy Corbyn left – has long been every bit as Eurosceptic \u2028as the right. They’re just less honest about it.Corbyn’s pitully weak role in the Remain campaign in  confirmed what anyone who had paid the slightest attention to his career already knew. He believed the EU was a malign force. Corbyn’s absence from yesterday’s march was not because there were Tories there and nor because he feared alienating Leavers, he was not there because he is the left cheek of the anti-EU arse. It is as simple as that.And so, as has become a modern tradition, it fell to Corbyn’s deputy – Tom Watson – to stand up for the values the Labour Party is supposed to hold dear.Treating his leader with the contempt he deserves, Watson said he was backing a second referendum as the only way to solve the Brexit crisis.He would be participating in – and speaking at – the Put It To The People march because the current parliamentary impasse was not working for either Leavers or Remainers.“I’ve come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this, and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public, is for the people themselves to sign it off,” said Watson. The only chance of bringing the country back together was, he added, to give everyone a “final say” and then live with the result.To the screeching fury chimps who pollute the internet with abuse of anyone who dares criticise Corbyn, this will have been further confirmation that Watson is impure. I mean, he went on a march with Heseltine – he must be a wrong ’un, mustn’t he The SNP has often deployed the “standing with Tories” missile to attack Labour politicians who oppose Scottish independence but, yesterday, senior nationalists – including party leader Nicola Sturgeon – were happy to do precisely that.Sturgeon and her colleagues could find it within themselves to unite with political opponents in pursuit of a common goal, but for adherents of the Church of Corbyn such pragmatism is heresy.MPs may have voted to reject a No Deal Brexit – and even Corbyn says such a scenario would be a mistake – but unless they can agree an alternative that’s acceptable to the EU, it remains a distinct possibility.Corbyn supporters might indulge the fantasy he can win an election that hasn’t actually been called and then strike a deal which works for the UK, but the reality is that they are fellow travellers– whether they like it or not – of such Tory Brexiteers as Jacob Rees-Mogg and Dominic Raab. They are standing by, doing nothing, while Brexit looms, threatening jobs and diminishing the UK in the eyes of the rest of the world. That’s not a display of moral courage but of craven capitulation.Corbyn’s leadership –one can characterise it as such – of the Labour Party has been quite the rollercoaster ride. Elected as the champion of a new, gentler, kinder, more compassionate politics, he was long ago exposed as a drab, unpleasant little man whose ideas were forged – and remain – in the foreign country of the past. Supporters may tell themselves his boycott of yesterday’s march was a display of integrity but, in fact, it was just the latest in a long line of moments when Jeremy Corbyn was on the wrong side of history.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why scotland s roads aren t ready for electric scooters alastair dalton","story":"Electric scooters are common in parts of Europe and the US and the UK Government is considering whether to allow them on British roads. Alastair Dalton explains why that would be a mistake.They offer a potentially attractive new way of getting about – but also threaten chaos on Scotland’s car-centric road networks.Electric scooters are commonplace in some European countries and US states, and the UK Government is now considering whether to allow them here too.Ministers announced this week they will “consider options for appropriate testing regimes to ensure any such vehicles on the road are safe and fit for purpose”, which could be followed by localised trials.On the face of it, being able to hop on and effortlessly zip about our towns and cities has obvious appeal – especially to non-cyclists.It is hardly “active travel”, like walking and cycling, but could encourage some to switch from cars or taxis on short journeys.Anything electrically powered, which has no emissions on the street, also has to be a positive as part of efforts to cut urban air pollution.However, letting loose a new form of transport on roads still woefully unsuited for cycles could just make things worse for everyone.That’s not to say there’s not a case for them – but the radical redrawing of road space away from the car should be accelerated first.The brave would take their chances scooting among other traffic, though many are likely to be deterred from sharing roads with lorries, buses and taxis, let alone the cars who already pass cyclists intimidatingly close.: Electric scooters on British roads would create ‘dangerous cocktail’There’s also the small matter of scooters’ in wheels not being pothole friendly, causing discomfortnot danger, as shared transport group Comouk has highlighted.Most who scoot are likely to want to stick to the relative safety of pavements and cycle lanes –that is permitted. But here, a dferent risk is created, of scooters colliding with pedestrians.There are far too few cycle lanes they could use, on roads or pavements, and even fewer segregated lanes, albeit cities like Glasgow are adding more.In addition, there is already potential conflict between walkers and cyclists on shared paths, some of which would struggle to cope with more riders, let alone scooters too.Another concern is street clutter. Recent visitors to Berlin and Brussels tell me of large numbers of scooters strewn across pavements.Technology may now enable scooters to be left “dockless”, but this has caused a big problem in places like San Diego.It’s bad enough trying to negotiate pavements already littered with advertising A-boards, so this could cause another hazard.Karen Millhouse, a resident of the Calornian city, emailed me this week: “I think we have more than , dockless scooters in our fair city, and they just keep coming. It is a nightmare, especially for pedestrians and the disabled.”She said Disability Rights Calornia had even filed a class action against scooters blocking pavements.: Alastair Dalton: The ‘electric-bike smile’ is now officialA better plan for Scotland – and the UK – would be to focus on electric bikes first. The main rental schemes in Edinburgh and Glasgow are due to add them later this year, along with other parts of Scotland such as Stirling.Electric bikes are equally effortless to ride, but unlike scooters provide nearly as much exercise as traditional cycling, so have much more to commend them.They also encourage people to cycle further, and have a similar topspeed – mph – as has been proposed for scooters.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"independent scotland could ditch queen for president","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...An independent Scotland could ditch the Queen and adopt an elected president as head of state, according to a proposed written constitution that has been submitted to ministers.

Organisers claim up to one million took part. The EU has agreed to extend the UK’s originally scheduled departure this Friday, but with May’s deal poised to be rejected again, the situation remains mired in uncertainty.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s absence from the People’s Vote march yesterday was widely criticised and underlined the lack of consensus on a way forward on the constitutional impasse.Sturgeon received widespread cheers as she addressed the campaigners in Parliament Square yesterday afternoon. “Parliament should take back control,” she said.“Scotland – the land where more than  per cent of people voted to remain in the European Union – our voice has been ignored.”Sturgeon added: “Today we make our voices heard. And what our voices are saying loudly and clearly is this: Put it back to the people.”Watson was the only senior Labour figure at the rally and pledged to back a People’s Vote, amid concerns that Corbyn remains unconvinced. “We are one million strong,” Watson said.“Prime Minister, you’ve lost control of this process, you’re plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control.”Khan said it was “time to withdraw Article ”.He added: “it’s time to give us, the British people, a final say on Brexit.”Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson joined protesters, along with senior Tories Dominic Grieve and Justine Greening, as well as Anna Soubry of the recently founded Independent Group at Westminster and Green MP Caroline Lucas.The House of Commons may get the opportunity to vote on a second referendum this week, despite a recent Commons vote which saw the proposalheavily defeated by  votes to , when Labour abstained.However, even with every Labour MP voting in favour, the bid for a new referendum would have failed, meaning Conservative opponents of a People’s Vote must be convinced to change their minds, or at least abstain, for it to have any hope of being approved by Parliament.Senior figures in the SNP and Labour said they have spoken to Tories who previously rejected a People’s Vote, but are now willing to allow it to pass the Commons.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said a number of Conservative MPs had privately told him they supported a second EU referendum, but would only vote in favour once Labour is committed and a People’s Vote is likely to win Commons approval.“It is the right thing to do to go back to the people, and I actually believe thatwe had that unity across the opposition benches, that would put pressure on a number of Conservatives,” Blackford said.“A number of Conservatives say they want that to happen as well, but they do that privately, but they won’t break publicly.”Opposition leaders met with Corbyn this week and emerged disappointed, saying he insisted that a public vote could only be calledLabour’s proposed Brexit deal was on the ballot.A senior Labour MP told Scotland on Sunday that the internal battle over a second referendum was being won by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who back a People’s Vote, over Corbyn and his official spokesman, Seumas Milne – both of whom hold Eurosceptic views.“When it comes to a People’s Vote, it’s Starmer and McDonnell vs Milne and Corbyn. Bit by bit, we’re shting things slowly inside the party so that their views are irrelevant and their position becomes untenable,” said the frontbench MP.They added: “There are Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to who will abstain when it comes to another vote.

The Lothians MSP is facing a defamation action brought by Stuart Campbell, who runs the blog, after he claims she accused him of “homophobic” comments on social media.Wings rose to prominence in the build-up to the  referendum and has remained a trenchant critic of what he views as bias against the independence cause in the “mainstream” media.Media experts say the case will throw into focus the growing influence of the new media in the political sphere.: Nicola Sturgeon calls on MPs to seize control of Brexit from beleaguered Theresa MaySimon Pia, a lecturer in journalism at Edinburgh Napier University and former communications chief with Scottish Labour, said the rise of bloggers such as Wings is “indicative of the sht” in political debate.“What he [Campbell] did is fill a vacuum that was felt among the independence movement and Nationalists… that there was nobody in the mainstream press that represented their position,” he said.“He was very successful, he’s got a huge amount of followers, his crowdfunding is quite staggering, but there’s a political passion behind it.”A fundraising campaignundertaken by Wings raised £, in March last year, according to the site. Dugdale, by contrast, had her legal costs support pulled by Labour. The Daily Record, where she made her claims, has pledged support.“That shows you the power of the new media,” Pia added. “There’s an audience out there. If people don’t think mainstream newspapers are reflecting their views, people will go there.”Recent years have seen the emergence of similar websites south of the border, such as the left-wing Canary and Noa, which emerged amid concerns over the media coverage that Jeremy Corbyn received.Professor Alistair Duff, who specialises in new media at Napier’s School of Arts and Creative Industries, has carried out research into new media and says they have brought a “punk energy” to the political debate.But this comes alongside concerns about the impact on “rational, critical discussion” in the public sphere.He added: “There should be reasoned discourse in the political and public sphere.“I think that e-pundits have sometimes, like punk did to music, brought a great, new energy and revived democratic politics. “But it’s also brought as punk did, a somewhat intemperate tone.”And while some commentators have labelled the proleration of bloggers as the fth estate, Duff says this emerging generation of political “e-pundits” are dependent on the fourth estate – newspapers – for the discourse that they feed off.“They’re dependent on the fourth estate – although they’re derogatory often about the fourth estate and dismissive of it – for environment, information and impact.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters.

I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SNOWCOW-2.jpg","title":"lewis and harris womens football team kick off new league in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine with a barnstorming - away win over Nairn Ladies FC.The long trip to Nairn for their league opener on Saturday proved to be one to remember for the islanders as they enjoyed a resounding victory to get their league campaign up and running in emphatic fashion.Played in freezing conditions on Nairn showfield, the Lewis and Harris club fielded a young side made up largely of - and -year-olds # with just three non-pupil players included in the squad.After missing a penalty, Ann-Mairi Macleod made history by becoming the scorer of the first goal in the newly-formed Highlands and Islands league.Macleod#s goal opened the floodgates as the visitors went on to score five more in the first period # thanks to a goal apiece from Jessica Macleod and Hollie Martin, and a hat-trick from Mary Macleod.Lewis and Harris were in dreamland in the second half as they proceeded to score a further  goals.

The then mayor of Ballymena took great pleasure in launching the service at Leighinmohr House Hotel.Such a service does not exist today, however many would argue there is no need for it as most people have access to a car or indeed online banking, a feat not yet possible in !O’Neill faces protestorsThe then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Terence ONeill faced protesters at Randalstown Orange Hall while he was addressing Bannside constituents.He faced calls inside the meeting, with people shouting: “ONeill wont go!” to which Randalstown Unionist Dr. Bolton Minford responded: “ONeill is here, ONeill isnt going and he wont go!” Meanwhile, a group of ‘extreme Protestants’ in the audience of nearly  people gave the Prime Minister a noisy reception as he spoke to Bannside constituents.

From pizza to pasta, Italian food is right up there with so many people’s tastebuds.As a lover of all things Italian, I was hugely excited when the Balmoral Hotel recently started their ‘Italian Night’, available every Tuesday night from -pm. I am no stranger to the thriving Black’s Road establishment and given the quality of food available in the Lady Anne Bistro and the conjoining Stix # Stones, the special-themed night attracted me to pay a visit once again to the Balmoral last Tuesday night.As ever, we were greeted by a polite and accommodating member of staff on arrival and shown to our table. I was immediately drawn by the décor – a number of Italian flags scattered around the restaurant and a huge blazing fire which was the perfect welcoming as Storm Gareth continued to rage outside.The themed-menu consists of a range of dishes sought to bring out the authentic taste of Italy and I couldn’t wait to peruse my choices. From pizzas to lasagne and pasta, there looked to be something for everyone, with gluten-free options also available.Before we had made our choice, we were presented with a large plate of Italian antipasti – basically a mixture of famous Italian nibbles. Much to my surprise, this is a complimentary touch from the Balmoral on the Italian night, designed to delve you into the full authentic Italian experience straight away.I gazed excitedly at my partner across the table. Where would we start  There were sticks of garlic bread, doughballs, pepperoni, olives and a pasta salad. Add in some jalapenos, peppers with a mouth-watering vinaigrette and mozzarella, it was a sublime clash of flavours which made me feel right in… well Italy! It reminded me much like a version of Spanish Tapas or Chinese Dim Sum which allows for iety and quantity of dferent options. With quality too, the night was off to a flyer with this beautul antipasti starter.On to the main course and after the wonderful starter, me and my partner could not wait for it to arrive. We both went for pizza, and to be honest it would be hard not to given the mouth-watering choices on the menu. A superb handcrafted gourmet pizza range, inidually designed with the finest ingredients for your own authentic taste of Italy – it was simply a no-brainer.After much deliberation, I opted for the BBQ Pizza, which consisted of a BBQ sauce base, mozzarella, chorizo, peri-peri chicken, jalapenos, onions and sweetcorn. Drizzled with just amount the peri-peri sauce, it was a concoction of flavours. A thin-base is always a must for me in order to properly enjoy what is actually on the pizza, instead of having to chew excessive amounts of pizza dough and again this pizza ticked all the right boxes. A BBQ-base and chicken on a pizza is nothing out of the ordinary on a pizza menu but this one was unique, given the intense flavour from the peri-peri sauce. This pizza would put some “Italian” pizza takeaways to shame, quite frankly. It was that good.Across the table, my partner, who is a vegetarian is no stranger to a good old pizza, after all it is entirely possible to enjoy the classic Italian dish without any meat at all. The menu includes a fantastic make-your-own option from an ingredient list with everything you can think of on it, allowing you to be as adventurous as you like. She went for a classic tomato base complete with mozzarella and a generous helping of sweetcorn, peppers and jalapenos. The pizza looked like a veggie’s delight and again it could not be faulted. Not too heavy on the stomach and full of flavour, it was little surprise she deliberately wanted to keep a few slices to take home.The pizzas also allow for additional sides, and it wouldn’t be an Italian night without some Garlic Bread. I simply adore anything garlic and this was what garlic bread should be like – oozing with garlic butter as it was torn apart, you could tell it was handcrafted and homemade to perfection. Our additional side of garlic potatoes also trumped the other side options of skinny fries or a tossed salad. It was a carbs heaven evening overall but worth it for the quality and taste of the food we enjoyed.A packed Tuesday night in the Lady Anne Bistro could only mean other diners, like ourselves, were enjoying the authentic Italian-themed menu on offer. It was something very unique and to their credit, the wonderful team of chefs and staff at the Balmoral are pulling it off to perfection. Most of the pizzas are priced around the £ mark which is more than worth it, just think how expensive it can be to order a takeaway from some well-known establishments. The Balmoral Hotel is excelling and the Italian-themed night is just the latest incentive to what is a fantastic establishment. Warm and friendly staff, quality food and best of all, it’s right on your doorstep. I could not recommend the Italian night anymore. Go and check it out for yourself and tell me you don’t feel like you have been to Italy for the night. I cannot wait to plan my next Tuesday nightvisit.Balmoral Hotel,Blacks Road, Dunmurry, Belfast BT NFTel:    balmoralhotelbelfast.co.u"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"butsy was larger than life and loved by many","story":"BORN on September   the late Pat ‘Butsy’ Butler has been described as a “larger than le figure” and“someone who was known and loved by many”.Pat, who passed away on December  , was educated at St Teresa’s Primary School on the Glen Road, before moving to St Malachy’s College where he completed his secondary education. The Glen Road man’s first job was as a compositor printer with Pitman’s University Press. However, during these early working days, he undertook voluntary youth work within the greater West Belfast area and soon realised that this was where his future lay. Eventually Pat left Belfast for Leicester University where he achieved his degree in youth and social care, following this up with a Master’s degree from the Ulster University. Pat eventually became a youth worker in charge at St Michael’s Youth Club, Finaghy Road North, where he spent many happy years. During this time, Pat managed a number of the youth football teams, with home games being played at Woodlands playing fields. Pat’s brothers commented that to say he was “vocerous” in his coaching would be an “understatement”. “In fact the story goes that at this time, house prices in Orchardville depreciated by  per cent!”At a time when West Belfast was often in turmoil, the youth club was a haven for young people a place where parents knew their children would be safe. Pat took this onboard and enabled the young people in his care to reach their full potential. Pat developed an insatiable love for sport from a very early age. He joined Davitt’s GAC for a short time before transferring to St Agnes’ where he spent many happy years as both a player and manager. In the course of his time with the ‘Aggies’ Pat, along with many of the players, made those never to be forgotten trips to the continent and of course Shannon events that proved to be hugely enjoyable and deeply spitural ventures. A serious arm break when he was  curtailed Pat’s playing career but he had much success in his managerial roles. Pat, affectionately known as Butsy, also loved soccer and had a long and enjoyable time playing for and supporting Dominic Savio. During the ’s, Pat embraced the basketball scene and in particular St Gall’s basketball club. Pat was committed totally to this new undertaking. In fact, his brother Gerard remembers ing back to Denewood one day and discovering a very large American making himself a cup of tea. Of course Pat had not told Gerard that ‘Soupy’ Campbell would be staying for a few days – a bit of a shock. As a commentator and administrator Pat gave  per cent to this new venture. His famous commentary during lives games in the Andersonstown Leisure Centre is still talked about.On the sporting front, Pat finally finished up as a member of Falls Bowling Club where he spent many happy years as a player, administrator and advisor to the long suffering groundsman. Pat eventually became the club president, something of which he was particular proud of. He also became president of the private greens – a role which again Pat embraced with diligence and total commitment. A spokesperson for Falls Bowling Club described Pat, their th President, as someone with a personality that “could fill the Waterfront Hall”. “His passing has left a gap that we will not attempt to fill.”Married to Shelia since August  , Pat lived le to the full, had a hugely positive influence on many and ultimately made a dference. He will be sorely missed by all who knew him."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"history man joes lifetime in community","story":"HAVING been involved in community development for the best part of three decades, Joe Baker is a familiar face to many in North Belfast, but he is probably most recognised as one of the city’s leading resident historians.Joe has been involved with the Ashton Community Trust virtually since its inception in the early-s and now sits on its board. It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"priceless 1916 artefacts to go on show at opening of new james","story":"AN ORIGINAL  Proclamation along with the printing blocks used to create the document are among the historically invaluable artacts to go on display for the first time ever together when Áras Uí Chonghaile opens its doors next month. The Gaeltacht Quarter-based £. million three-storey building is set to welcome tourists and visitors from Saturday, April  when the centre opens to offer an interactive exhibition, study area, a fascinating library of Connolly’s writings, café and conference facility. The opening of Áras Uí Chonghaile comes three years after a statue of James Connolly was unveiled outside the Falls Community Council to commemorate the th year of the Easter Rising. The bronze statue was unveiled by a great-grandson of the  hero, James Connolly Heron, who described West Belfast as Connolly’s “spiritual home”.The ambitious project, led by Fáilte Feirste Thiar, will host a pageant parade on April , Good Friday, and will leave from Conway Mill, a site where James Connolly organised mill workers during the time he made West Belfast his home. “Aras Uí Chonghaile is designed to celebrate everything James Connolly contributed to Belfast, Ireland and beyond,” explained Fáilte Feirste Director Harry Connolly. “There are five core elements to the centre, starting with the ground floor, world-class visitor exhibition. The first floor of the centre will house the Connolly Library and will consist of the world’s finest collection of writings including books we have secured from when James Connolly spent his time in Kilmainham Gaol. The fourth element of the centre will be an event and conference space, with all the first class facilities you would expect.”Harry told the Andersonstown News that a year-long events programme has also been planned with folk sessions, film club meetings held once a month in conjunction with Sean Murray’s Respect film company, and a series of seminars and lectures.“We are also delighted to announce that Hatch Café will take up residence in the centre as our hospitality partners and will be open to the public,” he said. Áras Uí Chonghaile centre manger Séanna Walsh spoke of how the centre will host a programme of events that will try to emphasise that “It’s not just about Connolly the Irish rebel, it’s as much about Connolly the trade unionist, the guy who organised the mill workers in Conway Street, the guy who went to the States and organised several trade unions there, who all take their lineage right back that far.” Séanna continued: “There will be a major educational element to the centre, we want schools, colleges, universities coming to see the project.“It’s ground-breaking the things we will have on display for the first time: an original Proclamation and also a half Proclamation which was actually produced by the British to use in evidence during the court martial.“Having the seven signatories at the bottom was all they needed, those along with the original printing blocks will be displayed for the first time ever together. “At the end of the day, the centre has to be Connolly in the round. Not the one-dimensional Connolly – the Irish rebel. It’s important to the legacy of the man this centre is seen as a resource by the trade unions right across the island.”Harry said that there is no doubt Áras Uí Chonghaile will become a key part of the city’s tourism trail. “We want to thank our funders Belfast City Council and the wide range of sponsoring trade unions from the States that have pledged and delivered key financial resources which haveallowed the centre to become a reality.” "},{"url":null,"title":"alevel northern ireland school league table","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The airport is to increase the number of security lanes from six to eight by Easter.Belfast International Airport has been approached for comment on the ranking of its lounge.A Which  Inspector was less than impressed with what the airports lounge had to offer.\"We were particularly looking forward to the sumptuous buffet, imagining all sorts of treats that might be available,\" the Inspector said. \"What we found was that the buffets ‘hot selection’ was just a single soup: sweet potato and butternut that was bland. This was accompanied by a pair of poor quality wraps. Sparkling wine and champagne wasnt included and there was a drinks limit. \"The wi was the standard free wi for the airport, rather than a dedicated or faster service for lounge guests.\"The experience was not all bad for the Inspector.\"Staff were friendly and the lounge was spacious and a welcome break from a very hectic airport but very expensive for what you actually get,\" the Inpsector said. \"I’d expect the fee to contribute to a much higher quality of food.

The  Open Championship is set to take place at Royal Portrush Golf Club from July - and DfC believe the new proposals \"will contribute to the success of the event and improve the prospects of this event and others coming to Northern Ireland in the near future\".The department said the plan \"would benefit the hospitality and tourism sectors in Northern Ireland\".

Any event given the special dispensation would have the power to y permitted hours for the sale of alcoholic drinks at the event.

split public opinion, were unveiled in September  by Down to Earth Ltd, which hosted a series of public consultation meetings to outline the detail of its proposal.Those behind the lsquogreen graveyardrsquo project, which would be sited off the Ballyculter Road and contain parking provision for  cars, say they are confident that the proposal would have a low environmental impact and offer an alternative to those seeking an environmentally-friendly approach to burial.They argue there are no designations that would preclude a development of this nature and that the proposal will enhance the location by creating and enhancing shared space, supporting good design and improving the built and natural environment.Supporters of the project also contend that the project will ldquopreserve restore and enhance ecosystems, turning an arable field into a nature reserve.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed they had representations in support and opposition to the proposal, with the planned burial site having no headstones, with all burials recorded on a map.Signicantly, planners confirmed that while there can be no objections in principle to the proposal, those behind the project had not provided the requested additional information.They revealed that while extra time was allowed to comply with the request, no further extension was being afforded with the recommendation to refuse the application now being made.Planners added: ldquoWhile it is considered that the proposal will not create any unacceptable visual or residential impact due to its nature, it is considered further information is required for the consultees which also encompasses a number of concerns raised from interested parties.Planners confirmed Environment and Rivers Agencies are among those who still require further information to enable them to fully assess the planning application and provide detailed comment.Planners had described the information they required as ldquocrucial and pertinent to the application and that it was most unfortunate that it has not been provided.They said while there may be no objection in principle to the proposal ldquoit

Since then Exploris curator Peter Williams has kept a watchful eye over the  month-old old turtle.Mr Williams said: ldquoThe loggerhead turtle arrived at Exploris Aquarium in a critical condition from a beach near Rosbeg, Co Donegal.ldquoSince then we have been working tirelessly to slowly raise the turtlersquos temperature by a couple of degrees every day. Our veterinary team also decided to administer a course of antibiotics as an increase in temperature heightened the risk of a secondary infection setting in.He added: ldquoI am now happy to report that JC is making slow but great progress and is feeding well on a iety of fish and invertebrates. He is also receiving a gelatin diet, full of calcium, vitamins and minerals, which is important for the development of his shell.ldquoAs JC has taken well to rehabilitation we have decided that it is best for him to be moved to a larger space as he will have more room to swim and e.ldquoLuckily he has responded well to treatment and is currently settling in to his new home where visitors to the aquarium will be able to get a glimpse of the vulnerable species as he continues to recover.The future is looking bright for JC as the team at Exploris will continue to monitor his weight over the coming months. They plan to release him back to his natural environment when he has fully recovered.Loggerhead turtles like JC can live to about  years of age in the wild and usually reach about three feet in shell .Mr Williams says the ultimate goal is to release the reptile back into the wild in warmer waters.This is not the first time Exploris has tried to nurse a lost loggerhead turtle back to health.In January , another loggerhead was found washed up on a Co Donegal beach and was also taken to Exploris suffering from hypothermia.Staff named that male turtle Columba, but sadly it died a short time later, making JCrsquos recovery all the more remarkable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"McKinstry is on the mark at Jimmy’s 10  ","story":"THE Beast from the East was well and truly caged this year as the day dawned bright and sunny, although with a noticeable frosty nip to awaken unsuspecting toes and fingers of the small army of East Down clubmen and their cons which descended on the sleeping streets of the county town on Jimmyrsquos Ten Sunday.Their mission was to display the necessary Kilometre markers and warning signs around the soon to be crowded route.Time was of the essence as upwards of , runners and walkers had signed up for the biggest participation sporting event in the district and with the start brought forward to am, to facilitate the festival paradersquos new start time of pm, it was going to be a tight run affair to have all in place before the runners took over.But, as ever, the super team managed it with a bit to spare.It should be pointed out that at am the pathway at the Quoile was water free.

Charlesrsquos mum was in the house when part of it collapsed and had to be taken to hospital.Sr Mary explained the scale of the damage was such that the remainder of the womanrsquos home had to be bulldozed, explaining the plan is to build a replacement on the same site.ldquoI know the lady very well and visited her when I previously worked over there, she continued. ldquoI am in regular contact with her son, who was my administrative assistant.ldquoI hope we will be able to raise the money needed to build the new home so she has her own roof over her head.

There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.Lidl submitted plans to secure outline planning permission to redevelop the . acre Shanslieve Drive site in January last year. It plans to bulldoze the existing school to pave the way for the construction of a new , square metre supermarket food store and dedicated centre for the volunteers who run the mountain rescue team.A new entrance via Bryansford Road is proposed, but there will be no access from Shanslieve Drive. The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of last weekrsquos meeting, planners confirmed that none of the statutory consultees including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, had lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners have insisted that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and that there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which could accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.The supermarket giant says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Prenter goals just the ticket  ","story":"ST Patrickrsquos Grammar School produced a sizzling display to get the better of a resolute Cathair Dhoire side in a nailbiting showdown at the Athletic Grounds in Armagh on Monday.The Red High had to show great fortitude and tenacity in one of the most exciting and entertaining MacLarnon Cup finals in years as the Derry amalgamation threatened to ruin St Patrickrsquos day.The Downpatrick lads werenrsquot found wanting when the chips were down and two goals from man of the match Tim Prenter mdash one in each half mdash was the main dference between the sides.Prenter was a deserved recipient of the award as he continually stalked the Cathair Dhoire defence at every opportunity and had them chasing shadows every time he went near the ball.Loughinislandrsquos Brandon Boyd opened the scoring for the Red High after only  seconds. Club mate Peter McMullan fielded the resultant kick out and released Ronan Connor to make it - to - after less than a minutersquos play.However, Cathair Dhoire started pushing up on the Red High kick-outs and this proved an effective tactic with scores flowing from Cahir McMonagle, Fergal Mortimerand Ben McCarronto take a - to - lead after just five minutes of free-flowing football.It could have been even worse for St Patrickrsquos as Cathair Dhoire wasted two excellent goal chances with superb defending from Bryansfordrsquos Jack Harbinson denying McCarron with a timely block.The Red High started gaining possession in and around the middle of the park, but they definitely missed the ball winning ability of Saulrsquos Ruairi OrsquoHare in this sector, although he did start at full forward.OrsquoHare picked up an injury while playing for the Northern Ireland U- team in a Centenary Shield game against Wales on Thursday night, but his switch to leading his sidersquos attack worked a treat.With seven minutes of non-stop football gone Prenter, a senior county hurler, left three defenders trailing in his wake as he cut through the Cathair Dhoire cover before drilling the ball low and hard into the bottom corner of the net.Not a bad goal considering there was absolutely nothing on when the Downpatrick player received the ball out on the left flank.The Red High now had a grip on the game and OrsquoHare plundered the next five points for his side, two from frees, but Cathair Dhoire kept in touch with two points from McCarron, leaving the Downpatrick school with a - to - lead after  minutes.The Derry amalgamation sensed blood and towering midfielder Oran McGrath plucked the ball out of the air and ended a bustling run with an improvised finish to the net.Cathair Dhoire were far from finished and unanswered points from McCarron, McMonagle and Mortimer had the sides level after  minutes with all to play for.It could have been curtains for the Red High at this stage, but lsquokeeper Eoin Maginn saved his sidersquos bacon with two wonderful saves.Ruairi Quinn edged the Red High back in front just minutes after being introduced and the impressive OrsquoHare made it a - to - game  minutes.Prenter then finished Cathair Dhoire off with a second sensational goal. McMullan converted a late free after OrsquoHare had been sent off and McCarron grabbed the last score of the game for a battling Derry side.St Patrickrsquos: E Maginn, J Harbinson, E Rooney, L Guiness, P McMullan, R Murphy, B Boyd , C Watson, R OrsquoHare , T Smyth , O Cunningham, N Laverty, T Prenter , R Connor , T Savage.

The British empire was a military and economic powerhouse driven by greed, but it did facilitate the spread of Christianity to far flung parts of the world. Letter to the editorBritish empire trade routes carried missionaries and bibles to distant lands, with English remaining a powerful medium for global mission today. These observations should not surprise uswe consider ‘The Spreading Flame’. ‘The Spreading Flame’ is a term used by historians to describe the explosive growth of the Early Church. The Roman Empire, Greek language and ‘God Fearers’ were all important factors in Early Church expansion. ‘God Fearers’ were gentiles attracted to synagogue worship, but never able to fully identy as Jews. They often embraced full Church membership with joy. Greek was a ‘lingua franca’ that allowed the gospel to penetrate erse language groups. The stability of Roman Empire trade routes allowed missionaries and manuscripts to safely travel over long distances. The later British empire had one very positive dimension that the Roman empire maybe lacked. The later British empire promoted human rights and challenged slavery. Sir Roger Casement is a venerated Irish republican martyr, but was knighted for his earlier le work as a British diplomat. A dossier compiled by Sir Roger proved pivotal in exposing human rights abuses in the rubber industry of the Belgian Congo.Archbishop Welby might benefit from reading a recent article by Dave Brennan of Brephos. The ‘media articles’ section of the Brephos website explores how Sir Roger scored a human rights coup, while employed as aBritish diplomat. That an Irish republican martyr, who worked as a British diplomat and was knighted, might be described as the father of twentieth century human rights investigations is quite fascinating. Fact is sometimes stranger than fiction. Is Roger Casement possibly one of the Ballycastle district’s most famous sons  If Sir Roger was alive today, and banquetting with Justin Welby, what UK human rights issues would he be whispering about in the Archbishop’s ear between glasses of Port  “Up to  abortions a day in Great Britain with -% of them for social reasons”.

But the consultants draft stage  report clearly states what weve all known for many years ndash which is that a by-pass must be part of any solution.\"There have been those who claim the Welsh Government dont have the funds for a bypass road.

The Caernarfon by-pass cost could spiral from the original pound. million to pound. million.\"Work towards a positive outcome is further forward than at any time since it was first mooted over  years ago.\"There are a number of other steps still to be taken before the cabinet will eventually decide which by-pass route option and other measures should be surveyed and designed in detail in stage .The council has promised a public consultation of the proposals in the future, giving everyone the opportunity to discuss and comment on the project with officials and consultants. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before.

The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport. The consultation closes on th March ndash please do get in touch and take part. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Leaders of political parties opposed to military rule urged a high turnout as the only way to derail Mr Prayuthrsquos plans.Thailandrsquos Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha casts his vote Mr Prayuth was among the first to vote in Bangkok, the capital, arriving in a black Mercedes after polling booths opened at am.ldquoI hope everyone helps each other by going to vote today as itrsquos everyonersquos right, he told reporters after voting. He played golf later in the morning before heading to an army base to await results.The election is the latest chapter in a nearly two-decade struggle between conservative forces including the military and the political machine of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a tycoon who upended tradition-bound Thailandrsquos politics with a populist political revolution.Mr Thaksin was ousted in a  military coup and now lives in exile abroad to avoid a prison term, but parties allied with him have won every election since .His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, who led the government that was ousted in , also fled the country after what supporters said was a politically motivated corruption prosecution.After the coup, political party gatherings were banned and pro-democracy activists and other dissenters were regularly arrested, interrogated and imprisoned. Just days before Sundayrsquos election, the Thaksin-allied Pheu Thai party said the houses of party officials and its campaign canvassers in some provinces were searched by military personnel in an act of intimidation.The partyrsquos leader, Sudarat Keyuraphan, said after voting in Bangkokrsquos Ladprao district that she was confident of winning.Leader of Pheu Thai Party Sudarat Keyuraphan ldquoI donrsquot say itrsquoll be a landslide. I donrsquot know. Depends on the people. But I think we can win this election, she said.Thailandrsquos powerful King Maha Vajiralongkorn issued a statement on the eve of the election that said the role of leaders is to stop ldquobad people from gaining power and causing chaos.It was also broadcast on Thai television stations minutes before voting started.Invoking a speech by his father, the previous Thai king who died in  after reigning for seven decades, King Vajiralongkorn said not all citizens can be transformed into good people so leaders must be given support in ruling to create a peaceful nation.He urged government officials, soldiers and civil servants to look after national security.It was the monarchrsquos second notable intervention in politics recently.

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years.

They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/west.jpg","title":"major ni firms in eleventh hour westminster plea to avoid no deal brexit","story":"Posted on Friday March  by John Mulgrew More than  of Northern Ireland’s biggest businesses – employing tens of thousands of workers here – have written to MPs in an eleventh hour plea to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit.  As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history. All Members of Parliament must consider the burden of responsibility that they now carry for this region’s future.” Those putting their names to the open letter include aerospace giant Bombardier, which employs around , staff here, Danske Bank and First Trust, along with agribusinesses such as Devenish Nutrition, Fane Valley and Linden Foods.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to.

There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation.
