She will be much more visible now she isn\u0027t being held back.\u0027She will lead both party reform and the development of a policy agenda that is credible, radical and actually connects with the voters we need to win.\u0027In a sign Sir Keir and Ms Rayner have not managed to bury the hatchet, one party insider asked: \u0027Who would want to be national campaign co-ordinator in name only with no power when you\u0027re made the scapegoat for the failures of Keir\u0027s team?\u0027Another supporter of Ms Rayner said: \u0027On Friday Keir couldn\u0027t answer a simple question about what Labour\u0027s vision is, what our offer is and how we will win back the voters in our heartland seats.\u0027Angela can answer that question and is the best person to lead the fightback in the Red Wall.\u0027 According to the Guardian, Oldham MP Jim McMahon, who ran the Hartlepool by-election campaign and is an ally of Sir Keir, complained to the leader\u0027s office that Ms Rayner had been \u0027dressed inappropriately\u0027 on a visit to the town on March 21. Photographs from the date show Ms Rayner in leopard-print trousers, heavy black boots and a hoodie. Ms Rayner\u0027s aides are said to have \u0027hit the roof \u0027 when they heard about the comment, but kept it from her to avoid fuelling the problems even further.Allies of Mr McMahon insisted he was simply unhappy about the pictures selected for a leaflet. Sources also told the Guardian that Ms Rayner was seen by the leader\u0027s aides as a \u0027working-class oik and a bit thick\u0027 who doesn\u0027t fit their \u0027patronising Camden style\u0027. Another Labour source, without loyalties to Ms Rayner, told the paper:  \u0027It\u0027s a clear mistake to fire someone who speaks like the people we need to talk to. It\u0027s a huge mistake from a bunch of snobs who don\u0027t like how she speaks.\u0027 Mr Burham - who fuelled talk of leadership ambitions over the weekend when he said he was ready to pick up the phone if the party needed him - said this morning that Ms Rayner\u0027s treatment was not \u0027right\u0027.\u0027I didn\u0027t like the way that was handled, I\u0027ll be honest, and I didn\u0027t see why we were getting a negative story on Saturday night when myself and Steve Rotheram and other people around the country had good victories to celebrate, so that wasn\u0027t right, but I don\u0027t think the way Angela was treated was right,\u0027 he said.\u0027But it\u0027s been resolved and we move on from this morning. There\u0027s a shadow cabinet in place now.\u0027I hope that they are getting on with the job in exactly the same way that I am getting on with the job.\u0027Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Sir Keir had tried to make Mrs Rayner \u0027carry the can for the poor results at the weekend\u0027.\u0027It does seem as if, certainly the people around him (Sir Keir Starmer), don\u0027t understand how the party works,\u0027 the former shadow home secretary told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.\u0027They tried to sack Angela Rayner in order to make her carry the can for the poor results at the weekend.\u0027They didn\u0027t seem to realise that because she\u0027s an elected deputy leader, you can fiddle around with her title, but you can\u0027t sack her, she remains a senior person in the shadow cabinet.\u0027When asked if it was the view of deputy leader Ms Rayner that Sir Keir wanted to sack her, Ms Abbott said: \u0027Yes, that\u0027s what all the briefing was about."},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus UK cinemas indoor gatherings 17","story":"Share this articleYou will have to quarantine at home for ten days on your return and take a PCR test on days two and eight - as well as a lateral flow test before the return flight.Or there is an alternative option that you could pay for an additional \u0027Test to Release\u0027 on day five to end self-isolation early.

For a bite-size section, head to pretty Perros-Guirec, two hours’ drive from Saint-Malo, being sure to try traditional galettes at Crêperie du Ranolien, before hiking the Pink Granite coast, with its rosy boulders reminiscent of Seychelles. Alternatively head for the Crozon peninsula, a three-hour drive cross-country from the port, for lovely swimming creeks and imposing headlands jutting into water the colour of mouthwash. The island loop one: Belle-Île-en-Mer, BrittanyWho knew there was a tiny island paradise so close to home, where white sands meet turquoise waves, lighthouses decorate promontories and sweet seaside cottages are painted candy colours. A little like a French take on the Isles of Scilly, Belle-Île-en-Mer has long attracted creatives such as Claude Monet, who painted its imposing Port Coton needles, and one of the early stars of the screen, the bohemian actress Sarah Bernhardt, who moved into the military fort here in 1894, hosting glamorous parties, with Edward VII among her guests. The fort is now a little museum, in a beautiful spot on the Pointe des Poulains, one of the highlights of the 51-mile coastal path that circles Brittany’s largest island. The path threads together the sheltered coves of the east, steep cliffs in the south, dunes for children to tumble down, and Le Palais harbour. Le Palais, the island’s main town, is where you’ll arrive if you take the hour-long ferry ride from Quiberon on the mainland. Ride the bus to different sections of the path and be sure to have an evening cocktail at Le Grand Large hotel, overlooking the sea. The magical forest one: Brittany’s mythical forestHolidays to Brittany are very often all about the sea, but there are magical walking routes too in the interior’s marshes, forests and hills. Brittany’s once-vast forest of Paimpont, west of Rennes, is thought to be the one referred to in medieval folklore and myths as Brocéliande, an enchanted, fairy-filled forest associated with Arthurian legends. Today, themed trails and a museum at the Château de Comper bring the stories to life, adding an ethereal slant to family walks on the forest’s network of fern-lined trails. Your closest base could be Brittany’s vibrant capital, Rennes, an hour’s drive south from the ferry port at St Malo. The dramatic one: Normandy’s Alabaster coast on the GR21For anyone yearning to tackle one of Europe’s mammoth GR hiking trails there couldn’t be a handier starting point than that of Normandy’s iconic GR21, which begins in the city of Le Havre, arrival port for the Brittany Ferries crossing from Portsmouth. Whether you ditch your car immediately and strike out to walk the full 115-mile route north to the fishing village of Le Tréport, which usually takes seven to 10 days, or drive to stroll shorter sections, is a matter for you and your thigh muscles to decide. The geology of this stretch echoes that on the other side of the Channel, with dramatic high white chalk cliffs earning it the moniker the Alabaster coast. While the beaches of Normandy might still be associated with the noisy barrages of D-day, now only the wind tussling the leaves and the odd gull call will prick your ears, leaving mental space for contemplation on a peaceful route voted best hiking trail in France in 2019’s annual French Hiking Federation survey. The path doesn’t always follow the coast due to the fragility of the cliffs, but descends often to beaches and villages tucked into ravines where rivers meet the sea, such as Fécamp, with an abbey, and Dieppe, with wonderful seafood restaurants. Look out too for second world war sites and Delacroix’s painting subject, St Pierre-en-Port. Just a little past Le Tréport, the lovely belle epoque seaside resort of Mers-les-Bains, with quaint bathing huts on a lively seafront, is a fabulous place to finish up. The boozy one: Normandy’s cider routeWhether you stagger it, swagger it or dart along like a teetotal hare, the 25-mile cider route is a beauty, connecting more than 20 cider farms in the lovely Pays d’Auge region of lower Normandy. Densely wooded hills, villages of colourful timber-framed houses, chateaux and farmland comprise a gorgeous backdrop for immersion in the appley booze-making expertise of the area. You’ll learn to appreciate the slightly bitter flavour of local ciders – neither sandpaper dry or juicy-sweet – perfect for quenching the thirst of parched hikers. Calvados (apple brandy), sometimes mixed with apple juice to make pommeau, has to be tasted along with perries and cheeses. Where should you base yourself? Try any of the characterful hotels in ancient towns such as Cambremer. The cultural one: the Loire estuary The Loire river may be most famous for the beautiful chateaux that decorate its banks, but many other interesting features lend it character as it wends its way west to the Atlantic. At its finale, a wide estuary forms a fascinating natural and semi-industrial environment that’s fun to explore on foot. A 37-mile trail through the estuary from Nantes to the ocean, takes in fishing villages, nature reserves and a fantastic art trail, the Estuaire Nantes\u0026lt\u0026gtSaint-Nazaire, featuring 33 mind-bending sculptures, dotted along the water’s edge. Picking out one section for a day’s walk, you might opt for the lively 11-mile stretch from Paimbœuf, a village of brightly coloured houses, to the seaside resort of Saint-Brevin-les-Pins, on the southern side opposite Saint-Nazaire. It offers sandy beaches, fishing huts on stilts and the art trail’s “Serpent d’Ocean” by Huang Yong Ping, a huge skeleton of a sea serpent submerged in the breakers that’s thrilling for children. Alternatively there are dozens of other shorter walking trails of a few miles throughout the southern estuary area, which are easily doable for little legs. The hilly one: the Alpes MancellesFor not-too-tough hiking challenges in a mountainous region that resembles a mini version of the Alps, head to the pretty Alpes Mancelles in the Atlantic Loire. The mountains here top out at only 200-400m, bless them, so are relatively easy to conquer, but will still earn you the kudos of having summited some of the highest peaks in western France. Le Mont des Avaloirs, at 416m, is the big boy of the region, providing wonderful views of the Sarthe river from a Brutalist-style concrete lookout point at the top. Across the unspoilt massif, hundreds of kilometres of paths explore wooded slopes and valleys, and loop from authentic villages such as Fresnay-sur-Sarthe, a medieval town on a rocky outcrop with a ninth century chateau to visit. There’s tons for families to do too, from hiking with donkeys to high-ropes courses in the trees.

Here is an extract from the summary (bold type from the original). It says that if “baseline measures” (ie, basic social distancing) remain in place at the end of the roadmap, the resurgence could be “very small”. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, acknowledged there were arguments both for and against face coverings in classrooms. He said: Barton said school and college leaders were once again being placed in a very difficult position, with many parents and staff keen to retain masks in classrooms. “For the sake of a few more weeks all this unnecessary anxiety could have been avoided and we don’t understand why the government is in such a rush over this issue,” he said.Johnson says that is “complete nonsense”. He says he wants to protect the integrity of the voting process. Johnson says the government and the devolved adminstrations are just focused on the pandemic. Q: Could the Indian variant lead to another lockdown in the winter? Whitty says things can come out of the sky. He would not rule it out. This is a very transmissible variant, he says. He says it may be more transmissible than B117 (the Kent, or UK variant). But it may be less likely to escape the vaccine, he says.Vallance says this is a big step. But over the next month a lot more people will get vaccinated. By mid-June, we will have a better idea of the impact of these measures. But we know the vaccines are having a big impact. Thing are pointing in the right direction, he says. Q: In the past you said you wanted people back in the office. Is that still your preference? Johnson says when he was running Transport for London he observed a “paradox of transport” the more people could communicate remotely, the more they wanted to meet face to face. He says he might be wrong but he thinks, from his experience of watching metropolises, that this is what will happen.Johnson says the government will give guidance nearer the time. He says he is optimistic that things will get back much closer to normality. But people will want to exercise their discretion.Johnson says, whoever he hugs, he will do so “with caution and restraint”. We all know what that means, he says. Q: The scientists say if you abandon all social distancing after 21 June, they don’t know what will happen to cases? Johnson says he hopes the 1 metre-plus rule can go then. Vallance says the modellers will assume some residual protection after 21 June, because they assume people will not revert exactly to what was happening before. Some people will still work from home. People will isolate if they are ill. And, as winter approaches, things like face coverings on transport may be needed, he says.Johnson says it is very important to proceed cautiously, but irreversibly. He says the government has given itself a “breathing space” after each lockdown easing. What is happening next week is a “very considerable unlocking”, he says. They should think about whether people are vaccinated, he says.But he says the Indian variant, B16172, is of concern because it is growing.This shows the impact of the vaccines. But the government is urging people to use their discretion. People should think about the safety of their loved ones, and remember that outside is safer than inside, and that ventilation makes inside safer. He says people should follow social distancing rules with people who are not friends and family."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e0013c2011c6cec79576e3484fb32ae0e7d0309/922_607_1684_1011/master/1684.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ac232403a9751c0dc9b2b393082a9786","title":"from using unexpected tools to practical prepping advice how to nail diy with tiktok","story":"As a man of cineastic pretences, I own a projector – or a “big telly” as I like to call it – but since moving, it’s been languishing in a box. Spending as much time indoors as we all have lately, setting it up is something that would improve my life immeasurably. A competent friend of mine helped me get the projector up in my last place. But between lockdowns and just plain asking too many DIY-related favours from the poor guy, I realised if I wanted to put something up on the wall, I was very much on my own. So I did what all humans do in times of need: I turned to the internet. Being an older millennial, I’d assumed that TikTok was beyond me. It’s the place where young people mime to music, right? Could the TikTok community really help? I have to confess, I was sceptical. To test the water, I decided to see what help I could get for putting up a picture – using hashtags to search TikTok for relevant videos. The picture I sought to hang is a wonderful illustration of my beloved cat Itzi, to serve as a constant reminder of who’s boss in the house. So it wasn’t something I wanted to mess up. To start with, I find a top tip from Kim, a home decor blogger who posts TikTok videos under the handle @clippercityhouse. She suggests filming myself holding a picture at different heights to decide on where I should place it. This is a great idea if you’re working on your own – as I was.I put the hook in the wall, and move on to the fiddly part of trying to get the hanging wire over. After struggling for a bit, @goodleyearth comes to the rescue with his tip to use an unexpected item of cutlery. Under calm tutelage, I place a fork upright on the nail and use it as a guide to get the picture on – I get it right the first time. Now this is the stuff I’m here for! I discover that DIY videos on TikTok are like having access to countless experts sharing learned knowledge, saving hours of misery, frustration and unnecessary holes in the wall. No more skipping through long, painful videos trying to find the relevant 30 seconds. After some nervous tea drinking, the picture of Itzi remains vertical. And so bolstered with caffeine and perhaps too much confidence, I set my sights on the shelf for my projector. After a quick search, I find that @haizzly has a useful video about prepping and priming wood. Soon the board is sanded, primed, sanded again, painted (is it starting to sound like I know what I’m doing yet?) and left to dry overnight. Woodshop Diaries – under the handle @woodshopdiaries – shows me how to drill wood without splitting, and even takes me through the basics of how a drill works in a cheerful and straightforward way. While it’s not necessarily essential for this particular task, it was a nice touch I really appreciated. And @constructiontips proves to be a treasure trove of, well, construction tips. Most of them are for tasks far above even my most lofty ambitions – however, there is a nifty trick I can see myself using in the future. It’s actually intended for picture hanging, but works well enough for a small shelf. Using tape and cardboard, I mark the drill points and have a template of where to drill the wall. Minimal fuss and no scrawling. Next, I check out @mcp_thats_me, who gives a brilliantly efficient overview of getting screws in the wall. Once this is done, I’m finally able to mount the shelf. The other useful thing about these TikTok tutorials is that they play on a loop, which is particularly handy if your hands are covered in paint, or you’re holding something heavy.A few days later, the shelf is still standing, the projector is working as it should and the wall is looking more interesting than it has in a long time.

Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireThe Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan has said that he would like to think that there could be spectators at this year’s All-Ireland finals.The more people who got vaccinated the more likely the return to events, he told RTÉ Radio’s News at One.Dr Holohan said that if there was really good progress and no difficulty with variants then outdoor events such as Electric Picnic could be considered along with sporting events.However, Dr Holohan said people should not get ahead of themselves and should still be cautious and maintain public health measures.The ambition was to “get through May” and then to move on to the easing of further restrictions on June 7th if all the current measures proceeded safely, “then we can look if other things could become possible”.Minister for Arts and Culture Catherine Martin has also signalled the return of spectator sports and live entertainment events later in the summer.Asked by RTÉ for a timeframe, she replied: “I think July at the latest, but I would be more ambitious than that and I’d like to see some live music test events take place in June because these venues and performers have been stopped by the pandemic from earning a living and we have missed performing, so I’m determined to make that happen as soon as possible.”Dr Holohan urged people who had been vaccinated to get out and about and benefit from being vaccinated but he warned that Covid-19 could transmit very easily in households and advised people to maintain public health measures.The Chief Medical Officer said he had written to the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to seek updated advice on the use of the AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccines on people under the age of 50 and he expected a response in the coming days. In the meantime the vaccine roll out would continue through May for at-risk groups and those over 50.“Then it is a question of what happens next. We might have increased flexibility on AstraZeneca and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson.”Dr Holohan said he was not concluding that the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine could not be used for younger age cohorts. He said there would be a vaccine for everyone and it would depend on the advice from Niac.Vaccines were being considered for under 18s but a recommendation would have to be given first, he added.Dr Holohan said he was not opposed to antigen tests or to retailers selling them but he was concerned about people’s interpretation of the result of a test. There was a risk that if someone got a negative result that might falsely reassure them when 50 per cent of antigen tests could be misleading and this meant the potential for superspreader events.“We can’t have people behaving as if they don’t have the disease when they do.”Dr Holohan said it was not a question of trust in the public it was the fact that the test did not give “a reliable enough” result.On the issue of foreign travel, he said it was getting near the stage when it could be examined, but it would not happen until it was safe and appropriate to do so. That was in the “near to medium term”.Mandatory hotel quarantine would continue for as long as it had value and was considered an effective measure to halt transmission.It had been a difficult year for so many people who had lost loved ones and who had suffered economic and social burdens, he added. The situation had improved and it would continue to improve if public health measures were adhered to, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"retail reopens it feels like christmas here today","story":"After five months of strict lockdown Ireland saw the return of non-essential retail by appointment, hairdressers, barbers and the resumption of religious worship in churches. Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAn overjoyed Laura Johnston from Ringsend leaves Penneys, Mary Street, with her arms full. Photograph: Dara MacDónaillThe It was almost as if someone somewhere had flicked a switch and turned a light on over Dublin. The gloom that has shrouded the city centre since the start of the year lifted overnight with the seemingly endless despair of the lockdown months suddenly replaced by optimism, joy and mountains of cheap knickers.While retail across Ireland will not fully emerge from its depressingly mothballed state until next week, shopping by appointment is the new “new normal” and the novelty of booking a slot in Penneys coupled with a desperate need for clothes meant queues forming outside the Mary Street branch on the hour, every hour, from 7am.Under the new rules of engagement, Penneys is allowing 100 shoppers through its doors every 60 minutes from dawn to dusk. There are 45 minutes allowed for shopping and 15 minutes for paying and leaving the shop. The public address system ominously alerts everyone to the unstoppable march of time each 15 minutes.Given the pressures all Monday’s shoppers were under, The  was just a bit afraid when making our approaches that we would have the heads bitten off us. Or worse. Who were we to be standing in the way of clothes?Our fear was entirely misplaced and everyone we spoke to was delighted to take a 60-second break to talk about why they were there.“I’m here for the socks, the pyjamas, the leggings and the knickers. You’d really miss Penneys, even for the little things for birthday presents. It is just so nice to be able to physically hold things,” said Aoife O’Connor from Clondalkin. “It is brilliant, there is hardly anyone in here and no queues. I’m delighted now I booked appointments for everyone I know.”Laura Johnston from Ringsend was weighed down by two large Penneys bags and one small baby. “I have knickers, pyjamas, leggings, shorts and loads of clothes for the baby,” she said. “I missed it so much, I missed it terribly. My baby is 1½ and he hasn’t had a sock to his name for months. He has loads of them now.”Another baby, one by the name of Frankie, was staring up at his mammy, Gillian Duggan from Clonsilla, as she piled clothes high on every available surface of his buggy. “I’m very excited to be back, it’s like a supermarket sweep,” she said.Even though Frankie came into the world just 10 weeks ago, his mam was full of beans and can-do spirit. “We have loads of appointments today,” she said. “Next there is Zara and then JD Sports and Bershka and Straarius at 2pm. I am really getting the steps in today, that’s for sure. I’ve missed it, it has been a very hard year so far.”If anyone needed proof that shopping is as much an emotional experience as it is a means to acquire stuff, it was on the faces of all the happy shoppers as they went through the racks with one eye always on the time.Not even a face mask could hide Aisling Walker’s smiles. The woman from Oliver Bond Street said she was “delighted to be back, absolutely delighted. I have underwear and pyjamas, but really it is just the thought of being in Penneys. And the appointment thing is great, I’ll be in and out before you know it.”Michelle Brady from Donard Avenue in Dublin 7 was equally thrilled. “You’d miss Penneys terribly, it’s like a magnet so it is. Before all this, on Saturdays I’d come in with my three grandchildren and we’d go shopping. It was a little treat. I am buying stuff for them today and for my husband. I might take a little spin up to Dunnes now too.”Aisling Alcock from Coolock was on her second Penneys appointment of the day having spent an hour around the corner in the O’Connell Street branch just after dawn. “I wasn’t sure I’d get Mary Street so I booked there first and then I got here too so I took both appointments,” she said. “So far I’ve spent three-fifty so I might have to budget a bit now.”When asked if she meant €3.50, she laughed: “G’wan out of that.” Then she disappeared, but minutes later was back, having scored a gold elephant and other bits and pieces for her beauty salon. Her sister was in tow this time.Tracy Alcock was shopping with her 10-week-old daughter, Ruby. “It is her first trip to Penneys but I think she is going to be a fan just like her mam,” Tracy said. Ruby said nothing but she looked intrigued by the world around her. “It is brilliant to get out a bit and to buy some clothes for her.”The staff manning the tills were full of smiles too. “It’s great to be back,” one told this newspaper as it queued with an armful of socks, T-shirts and baby clothes bought for, um, research purposes. “You’re the first man we’ve seen in here all day,” her colleague added.Outside Penneys, the city was suddenly alive with people. It was almost like Dublin in the rare auld times. There were people carrying bags, talking and laughing as they went about their days. There were scores of people waiting for appointments outside Zara and JD Sports and other shops along the stretch from Mary Street to Henry Street.Outside Arnotts, the queue was being policed by a woman dressed in super-cool black. As people approached her she checked their names on an iPad and in they went.Caoimhe Byrnes from Artane was wandering the cosmetics hall with a couple of bags already under her arm. “I am delighted to be back out shopping,” she said. “Shopping online is just not the same, there is no atmosphere and you have to wait for the stuff to arrive – but this is instant retail therapy.”Aideen Dune was almost as thrilled. “It feels like Christmas here today. More than the actual shopping, it is the return to normality that I am loving. The last lockdown was the toughest but I really think we are getting there now and the summer is going to be great. Hopefully this is the end of it now.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland reopens inter county travel resumes as hairdressers and non essential retail return","story":"After five months of strict lockdown Ireland saw the return of non-essential retail by appointment, hairdressers, barbers and the resumption of religious worship in churches.

Non-essential retail has opened for click-and-collect and appointment-only shopping as part of a major easing of lockdown restrictions. Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillA major relaxing on Monday of Covid-19 restrictions after five months of strict lockdown sees the return of non-essential retail by appointment, hairdressers and barbers, an easing of the rules around outdoor meetings and the resumption of religious worship in churches.Taoiseach Micheál Martin urged people to be “vigilant about personal behaviour” and to continue to take precautions against the spread of the virus as the country begins its largest reopening since last summer.Inter-county travel for non-essential reasons is now permitted.Mr Martin, who received his own first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Cork on Sunday, predicted a “psychological uplift” from this week with retail starting again.He also cautioned: “The natural instinct is to get out and meet people... but that does not mean we drop our guard in terms of personal behaviour.”Non-essential retail opened for click-and-collect and appointment-only shopping on Monday ahead of a full reopening next week.It comes as the HSE prepares to vaccinate 250,000 to 270,000 people this week, the highest number yet in the rollout.An estimated 240,000 people were vaccinated last week, including a record 52,000 on Friday.HindranceAs reopening commences, Mr Martin rejected suggestions that the Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) is proving a hindrance to the retail sector recruiting staff because people can get more by drawing the State support.He said he had heard retailers say they were finding it difficult to get staff in advance of reopening, but he disputed such difficulties were due to the PUP proving too attractive for workers.He said 100,000 people have come off the payment since February, “which kind of gives the lie to that notion that people are going to stay on PUP because it’s better than getting a job,” he said.Retail Excellence managing director Duncan Graham said: “Now, it is critically important that once we reopen, we stay open.”He said it was too early to tell if the PUP rate is discouraging people from returning to jobs, but it “could be an issue further down the road” as hospitality reopens later in the summer and both sectors compete to hire from the same pool of potential workers.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys on Sunday night offered no indication of when the Government intends to begin tapering the payments.She told The : “At the end of May, we will set out the future of PUP post-June 30th taking account of the trajectory of the virus, progress on the vaccine rollout, and the continued impact of the pandemic on the economy over the months ahead.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said about 12,000 businesses are expected to reopen their premises or resume normal trading this week, with 100,000 people due to return to work this month. He said this is happening after the longest lockdown since the pandemic began, and “I am determined to do all we can to ensure that it is the last”.Digital passportMr Martin, meanwhile, signalled that foreign travel will be possible later in the summer as he confirmed Ireland will participate in the EU’s planned digital vaccine passport regime once it is finalised.He said the EU’s timeframe is from June to the end of July in terms of the digital passport being in operation.He also indicated that he supports the use of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (J\u0026ampJ) jab for under-50s.The J\u0026ampJ vaccine was recommended for use in the over-50s by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) amid links to very rare blood clots in younger age groups.However, the Government is reviewing HSE proposals for changes in the vaccination programme which would include use of the J\u0026ampJ vaccines for younger people.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"tech firms are washing their hands of online lynch mobs says foster","story":"Outgoing Northern Ireland First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster  said the ‘anonymity of social media gives people a sense of invincibility. I want to tackle that.’ Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireNorthern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster has launched a blistering attack on social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Google, accusing them of washing their hands of “lynch mobs” systematically harassing women online.The recently ousted Democratic Unionist Party leader said online trolling is one of the biggest obstacles to women taking part in public roles in the modern era.And, in a possible hint at her plans after she stands down from the helm of her party and Northern politics within weeks, Ms Foster said she would work “with every fibre in my being” to eradicate barriers put in the way of female leadership.“Many people ask me what’s next for Arlene Foster, and I’m frankly not that sure at the moment,” she said.“But with every fibre in my being I will work to ensure the obstacles to women in public life are removed by the roots.”Ms Foster added that “one of biggest obstacles to being a woman in public life today is the constant social media trolling.”“The threats and the lies do take their toll, not just on you but those around you,” she said.Debate is “quite legitimate” in the public arena and it is “perfectly acceptable for someone around the table to say they don’t agree with you and here is why”, she told an online webinar organised by Queen’s University, Belfast.“What is not acceptable is for people around the table to mark out an opponent and then enlist the services of an anonymous online lynch mob to systematically target and harass women about their relationship status, their children, their partner, their appearance and the list goes on.”Ms Foster said the “anonymity of social media gives people a sense of invincibility.”“I want to tackle that,” she added.Verification process“There must be a verification process where the platforms at least know who really owns the account. I want the social media companies to recognise their responsibilities to women in public life.“Whether it is Google, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter or SnapChat, they can’t just step back as the publisher and wash their hands of the problem.”Ms Foster likened the inaction of social media platforms to fully police online abuse to “a government building roads without speed limits or engineering firms making heavy plant without guardrails”.The outgoing first minister, who is set to step aside from her leadership of the DUP later this month before relinquishing her role as co-head of the power-sharing Stormont Executive next month, was speaking at a live-streamed discussion entitled Reflections on Female Leadership.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill, also speaking at the event, said the “sad reality” is that women in leadership roles in all walks of life “are not treated equally or fairly” by society.“We are routinely overlooked, women are ignored, are denigrated and are attacked, because, simply, because they are women.”Women in public life are held to a different standard than male colleagues, she told the webinar, describing it as “constantly swimming upstream against a constant undercurrent of misogyny and abuse.”“Some of the commentary around women in political leadership is reprehensible,” she said.“You constantly face the derogatory comments about your appearance, threats of physical and sexual violence, death threats, threats to our families, all because we have dared to put ourselves out there to lead, represent and make our voice heard.”Ms O’Neill said she daily sees the “devastation” it causes to people’s lives.“It’s not okay, it’s simply not okay and we need to show people it is not okay,” she said.“The fact that we are still talking in 2021 about making sure 50 per cent of our population are treated as equals is a real travesty.

Since identifying in 2018 the so-called Golden State killer, who murdered 13 people and raped dozens in the 1970s and 80s, they have solved more than 50 other cold cases.While the development has been welcomed by the Innocence Project and those fighting for justice for the accused, others have serious concerns about the implications for privacy.Some of the more rudimentary DNA testing is being done by generating a subset of key markers from a person’s DNA code, like an abridged version of a book.But increasingly, investigators are turning to private companies for whole-genome sequencing, which reconstructs a person’s entire DNA code and gives investigators the tools to solve cases much quicker and easier.They then compare the DNA code with data from ancestry sites such as GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA.Unlike state and federal criminal databases, theirs are enormous, including millions of people who have voluntarily uploaded their own genetic information.Many, such as Ancestry and 23andMe, opted not to make them accessible to law enforcement.But data from GEDMatch, a popular website for tracking down lost family members, has helped police find a suspect in a case that reached trial just last week in Florida.Former sailor Thomas Garner, 61, was arrested in March 2019 for the 1984 killing of 25-year-old Pamela Cahanes, his fellow classmate at the Orlando Naval Training Center, after genetic firm Parabon NanoLabs re-tested a semen stain found on Miss Cahanes’ underwear. Further testing on the DNA sample allowed experts at Parabon to create the unknown suspect\u0027s “family tree,” which ultimately led the authorities to Garner.He has now been linked to a second cold-case killing in Hawaii around the same time, in 1982.GEDMatch changed its access policy not long after Garner’s arrest, requiring users to explicitly “opt in” to law enforcement searches. Ethicists said the decision ensured that users would be properly informed about how their profiles would be used.“People using genetic genealogy databases for their own purposes never anticipated this kind of access to their genetic information or that information being used to identify people they’re related to,” said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.There is “a genuine tension between wanting to protect consumers and be respectful of their wishes and recognising that working with law enforcement provides a social benefit,” she said.A recent Baylor College of Medicine survey last year found 91 per cent of respondents favoured law enforcement using consumer DNA databases to solve violent crimes, and 46 per cent for nonviolent crimes.The UK Government has conducted studies looking at how such DNA sequencing would work in Britain, but a decision on the controversial technique is yet to be made.In January of this year, GEDMatch adapted its policy to allow its entire database to be used for forensic searches related to unidentified remains.This gave scientists from the DNA Doe Project their break in identifying the body of an unknown woman in Indiana, thought to have been the victim of a serial killer who was prolific in the 1980s.They had a tiny biological sample, which contained only 0.3 nanograms, or 300 trillionths of a gram, of genetic material.It was first matched with just a handful of distant cousins, but when GEDMatch policy was changed the scientists suddenly found much closer matches which enabled them to identify her as Jenifer Noreen Denton, a 24-year-old mother-of-one from Illinois. They are now working on trying to find her killer.In Lee’s case, the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory has not yet searched the state database, despite being pressed to do so by the Innocence Project and Lee’s family.“We are glad there is new evidence in the national DNA database,” said Patricia Young, Lee’s sister. “We can only remain hopeful that there will be further information uncovered in the future.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to

Officials said the sonar system, known as a flank array, had been trailing behind a submarine when it was lost at sea.The disclosures came after it was revealed that the MoD wrote off £450 million in the 20192020 financial year in contract wrangles, lost equipment and ditched projects.Harry Fone, of the TaxPayers\u0027 Alliance, said: With the tax burden at a 70-year high, defence chiefs can\u0027t afford to waste a single penny.

Whereas fewer than 600,000 people died across the UK in 2018-19, projections suggest that the annual death toll will increase 20 per cent between that year and 2031.Chris Thomas, senior research fellow at the IPPR and the report author, said: “The pandemic showed the consequences of trying to tackle a huge spike in deaths without the right, proactive funding, workforce, training and coordination.“In too many cases, it meant traumatic final days for dying people – and for their friends, family and loved ones, too.”The IPPR report pointed to the use of non-consensual “Do Not Resuscitate” orders used in the early days of the pandemic as an example of the worst form of end-of-life care. The Care Quality Commission has identified at least 500 cases where the decision was taken without conversation with the dying person or their family.The report calls for the hiring of 2,700 care champions who would coordinate end-of-life services for patients, as well as £2 billion omre investment in community care a year to ensure “hospice quality” care in all settings, widely seen as the gold standard of care.It is also calling for the establishment of an “end-of-life academy” open to all workers and carers to improve training.Mr Thomas added: “The grim reality is that total annual deaths will reach pandemic levels by the early 2030s and without proactive planning, this risks an eternal 2020 in end-of-life care. To prevent this, the government must put in place hospice quality community care across the country to guarantee a dignified death for all.”The new report has drawn support from Marie Curie, a charity that provides support to people suffering terminal illness.Ruth Driscoll, its head of policy and public affairs, said: “We share the concerns that the IPPR has raised today about the need to learn lessons from the rush to community-based end-of-life care during the pandemic, which left too many people dying in private homes and care homes without the care, support and dignity they deserved.“Demand for palliative and end-of-life care is set to increase rapidly as our population ages. Ensuring everyone is properly cared for at the end of life must become an urgent priority at both a national and local level.”An NHS spokesperson said: “Since the beginning of the pandemic the NHS has offered care to everyone who needed it as well as urging patients and where required, their families, to continue to access the treatment they need – whether they are a care home resident or in the community. “All decisions around care and access to treatment, including end-of-life care, are made on inidual basis with patients, their families and clinicians and this continued to be the case throughout the pandemic.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brits need show photo id","story":"NewsBrits will need to show photo ID to vote in general elections under new lawGovernment plans to force Britons to show photo ID such as a passport or driving licence have been slammed as \"pointless\" as critics worry it will deter thousands from votingmirrorShareCommentsByChris KitchingSenior News Reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video keir-starmer-reshuffles-cabinet-following-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:bjjF,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

But former Tory cabinet minister David Davis has called the multimillion-pound plan pointless and unnecessary, describing it as an “illiberal solution in pursuit of a non-existent problem”. Civil liberties groups and race equality campaigns have also expressed fears about the proposal - which they fear could deter thousands of lower income and ethnic minority voters from voting. And Boris Johnson sparked confusion tonight by appearing to suggest the photo ID crackdown would only apply to first-time voters - as younger people are more likely to vote against the Tories.  The Prime Minister told a No press conference: What we want to do is protect democracy, the transparency and the integrity of the electoral process. And I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask first-time voters to produce some evidence of identity. Pollster Chris Curtis, of Opinium, tweeted: If this is true, then it is obviously a blatant and unacceptable partisan ploy and a pretty clear affront to our democracy. The Electoral Reform Society added: If new photo ID restrictions will only apply to first-time voters, itaposs hard to see how this wonapost make it harder for some voters over others. A fair election is one where we can all take part on the same basis. Government sources later claried the policy will not only be aimed at first-time voters, and it will apply to everyone, despite what the Prime Minister said. The PM curtly claimed it was complete nonsense that the policy would suppress non-Tory voters.What do you think of the proposal  Join the conversation in the comments section below.Rules will also be tightened on absent voting and voter intimidation. The photo ID proposal was first raised by Mr Johnsonaposs Government in October , but it so far has not become law.It is expected to be included in an Elections Integrity Bill during the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday, the Independent reported. Tory MP and former Brexit secretary Mr Davis told the news website that voters should not be required to show ID at polling stations.He said: There’s no evidence that I’m aware of that there is a problem with voter fraud at polling stations.

If you’ve got an ID card, you’re putting a barrier in the way of people to exercise their own democratic rights, which is not necessary and shouldn’t be there. “It’s pointless, it’s a waste of time, it’s a waste ministerial effort and as I say it’s an illiberal solution in pursuit of a non-existent problem. And it will be expensive… for nothing.” Shadow democracy minister Cat Smith said the proposal addresses a problem that does not exist. In , police investigated  cases of alleged voter fraud, according to the latest figures from the Electoral Commission.  Of those cases, four led to a conviction and two people were given a police caution. Two years ago, the Electoral Commission concluded the UK has “low levels of proven electoral fraud” and there is no evidence of large-scale electoral fraud”.Critics of the plan say about a quarter of voters - often younger people - do not have either a passport or driving licence, thereported.Previously, the Government said people would be able to obtain a voting ID card from their local council before an election.

The pandemic squeezed the politics out of the campaign with people in forgiving mood towards the Government following last year’s bad mistakes. Freshly vaccinated voters were showing little anger, just a desire to pull together and get through it all. I say little anger, butI am honest, where I did detect this, it was directed more at Labour than the government. As I revisited areas where I used to receive strong political support, I was told that Labour had lost its way. What do you think  Have your say below Jeremy Corbyn still casts a long shadow. A woman voter in Chaucer Avenue told me: “I cannot believe I am telling you this but I voted Tory because of Corbyn.” When I told her Keir Starmer is very dferent, she snapped back: “You will have to prove it – you can earn my vote before I come back.” There was more like this. The message was clear: Labour needs to get its act together. Locally too, they were disillusioned with Labour councillors who were aloof from them, speaking a language that owed more to far-left platitudes than their everyday lives.  Despite the disappointment of the by-election loss, we are now going to see the re-building of Labour’s reputation locally, and similar fightbacks are taking place in many former Labour strongholds as Starmer supporters gain the upper hand over Corbyn’s army of zealots. ButI take away one abiding impression, it is that in towns like Hartlepool the political kaleidoscope has turned and Labour is not going to recover by attempting to bring back the past. A new model Labour party is being demanded by voters, who themselves have moved on.  In smart and proud former council houses now occupied by their owners, voters want a Labour party that understands their aspiration, believes in social justice, knows this has to be paid for and will ensure that fair rules apply to all – from hard-working welfare recipients to the rich and privileged. They want to be heard, not talked down to, and they want to get behind policies they feel are genuinely useful and relevant to improving their lives. Labour has not spoken to these voters for over a decade since Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were prime ministers.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy notice England’s lockdown rules will enjoy their biggest single easing yet from Monday  May, Boris Johnson has announced.The Prime Minister confirmed England is now meeting the “four tests” to move to Step Three of the roadmap next week. From next Monday, hugging between people from dferent bubbles will be allowed for the first time in  months People will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to  people - up from just six now. And crucially, people from dferent households or bubbles can meet indoors socially for the first time. These indoor gatherings will be limited to six people or a maximum of two households or bubbles - whichever is larger. That means pubs, bars and restaurants can reopen indoors for the first time since the New Year. But venues will still have to follow social distancing rules and table service only, while masks will remain. Likewise, the legal ban on travel outside the UK will be lted - but there’s still a maze of dferent rules. And school pupils will no longer have to wear masks in class or corridors - but should still get tested twice a week. Boris Johnson told a No press conference it was the biggest single change to lockdown - just as figures show the number of UK cases of the India iant have more than doubled in a week, to . He said it was a “very considerable unlocking” and “there will be a lot of extra movement, a lot of extra contact” as a result. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said deaths should stay low as older people have now mostly been vaccinated, but there is a risk of signicant spread amongst those in the younger age groups. So what can and can’t you do under England’s lockdown changes  Here’s a full rundown from May .You can finally hug loved ones againFrom May , the government will axe guidance in place since March  that says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside their household or bubble. With a third of adults having both vaccine doses, people will instead be told they can choose whether to socially distance from family and close friends. This means people can choose to hug, kiss or shake hands with friends or relatives in the park or in a home.  People do not have to take a lateral flow test before hugging, but it’s one way of reducing the spread of the disease. Likewise people could meet outdoors or with the windows open, or wear masks. There is no limit to the amount of time you can spend with people in a day, or the time spent in a pub or restaurant.Officials say this change is a move towards “living with” coronavirus into the future - and it does NOT mean social distancing rules have been scrapped.Close contact with an infectious person is still the most likely way to catch Covid- and the vaccine is not % effective. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June  - more of this below.  From May , people from dferent households or bubbles will be allowed to meet indoors for the first time since the New Year. This must be in a maximum group of up to six people or two households - whichever is larger. The six-person limit includes babies and children, they’re not exempt. However, this change means that for the first time since January, you can visit family where in England and stay the night .You can have sex with someone you don’t already live withThe indoor meetings ban is being lted, and guidance against any social contact is being eased. Taken together this means casual sex is back on. But people are still being advised to make personal judgements in line with the risks. It doesn’t mean you should go around touching anyone you meet. You can go indoors at pubs and restaurants - in groups of sixThe rule of six indoors applies equally to hospitality venues such as pubs, restaurants and cafes, as it does to private homes. This means they will be allowed to open indoors on May  for the first time since the New Year. As with private homes, there will still be a maximum gathering size of six people or two households at each table. Pubs will also be table service only, so you can’t prop up the bar. You’ll also need to wear a face mask when walking around between tables, and scan in on entry using the NHS Covid- app. But there is no need to order a “substantial meal” with a drink any more.You can have parties of up to  people outdoorsThe current limit of six people for outdoor gatherings will be removed on May . Instead, there will only be a much higher legal limit of  people for outdoor gatherings, except for some organised events as outlined below. This will mean large groups are once again allowed to gather in parks like last summer. You can go on holiday properly in EnglandCurrently, only self-contained holiday accommodation can open in England - and people can only stay with their own bubble. Once you can stay overnight with people from dferent bubbles on May , that means hotels, BBs and other holiday venues like hostels can reopen. England’s domestic tourism industry is allowed to be back in business.You can go on holiday abroad - but it’s severely limitedThe legal ban on taking a holiday outside the UK will be lted on May  and travel will be allowed. However, Brits ing from the vast majority of countries will have to isolate on their , either at home or in a £,-a-head hotel. Only ‘green list’ countries will be exempt from this and there are currently only a tiny handful of countries on the list, including Portugal and Israel. Most of the countries on the UK’s green list still require Brits to isolate when they get to that country, making holiday plans worthless. And evenyou can travel without quarantine at either end, youaposll have to fork out your own money for Covid tests to comply with travel rules. However, restrictions are widely expected to ease quite quickly as we move into June and July. You can stop making your kids wear masks at schoolFace coverings for pupils will no longer be recommended in secondary schools or colleges from May  - either in classrooms or communal areas. Face masks couldin some schoolsthere are local outbreaks, as officials admit some discretion will be needed. Twice weekly home testing for school pupils will remain to control infection rates. You canto university… just in time for the year to endUniversity students on non-practical courses can finallyto in-person teaching and learning from May . That is despite the fact students’ academic years will be over or nearly over by then. All students and staff will be encouraged to take three rapid “lateral flow” tests, supervised on-site, about three to four days apart. They’ll then be expected to test themselves twice a week for the remainder of the term.You can go to a funeral without worrying about a -person limitThe cap on mourners at funerals will be axed ahead of schedule on May . Currently funerals can only have  attendees while wakes are limited to . Instead of a -person limit, venues will decide how many people can attend safely while still keeping up social distancing rules. That means two metres between mourners, or one metre plus mitigations like masks, screens and ventilation - although evidently, hugging is now allowed. Wakes will still have a cap of  people. You can go to a big stadium event or theatre showFans canto sports fixtures in Step Three, with outdoor venues permitted capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is lower. In the largest outdoor seated venues, where crowds can spread out, up to , people will be able to attend, or grounds can be a quarter-full, whichever is fewer. Fans can attend larger performances and sporting events indoors, with capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is fewer. Other events have already been taking place - with bigger crowds and no social distancing - but theyaposre part of a special pilot scheme and people must get negative tests to enter.You can go to a sauna or steam roomGyms and spas were allowed to open at the last stage of the roadmap, but their saunas and steam rooms had to remain shut. Now they can restart - as can indoor group sports and exercise classes, which were restricted to outdoors-only before.You can go to museums and children’s play areasRemaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas, can reopen in Step Three. And so can indoor entertainment, such as museums and children’s play areas.You can go to the cinema - but you have to wear a maskCinemas can finally reopen for the first time in around five months on May . But film-lovers will have to wear masks through the show, unless they are eating or drinking at the time. Perhaps making popcorn-eaters even more annoying. You can go to parent and child groups - and your kids won’t count towards the limitParent and child groups can resume with up to  attendees. And unlike the other caps on gatherings, babies and children under five do not count towards the -person limit in these groups. That means  mums or dads can attend, and take their kids with them.You can have more visitors in a care homeCare home visiting will be eased further, with residents able to have up to five named visitors - up from two now. These named visitors can make regular visits and physical contact, although they should get a negative rapid test and wear PPE before visiting. Residents will also be able to make “low risk” trips outside their home without isolating for  days when they get back - a policy that caused outrage.You CAN’T break social distancing in the pubWider social distancing rules and regulations remain in place - such as in social care, shops and pubs and restaurants. Pubs and restaurants will still have to obey the one-metre-plus rule, where people stay two metres apart or one metre with mitigations like a perspex screen. Laws ordering venue owners to ensure customers are following the rules remain the same, despite the relaxation on hugging within a group.You CAN’T go around hugging everyoneImportantly, the new hugging guidance is aimed at people meeting within legally-allowed group sizes - six indoors,  outdoors. It does not apply to people from two dferent small gatherings hugging, or strangers hugging in the street or a pub. People will be told to exercise their own personal judgement in line with the risks. They will be urged to remain cautious, because some people are more vulnerable to severe illness than others and vaccines do not eliminate the risk from Covid. Boris Johnson said: “This doesn’t mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic we all know close contact such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeIt’s the most enduring coronavirus rule since before the UK first plunged into lockdown on  March . For  months, we’ve been told not to hug or shake hands with people we don’t live with.Now that is changing as Boris Johnson confirms England can move to Step Three of its lockdown roadmap next week.From next Monday, hugging between people from dferent bubbles will be allowed once again. People will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to  people - up from just six now.  And crucially, people from dferent households or bubbles can meet indoors socially and have overnight stays - in groups of up to six people or two households. It is not a free-for-all on hugging however, and social distancing remains in pubs and restaurants. Here’s a basic guide to the new rules. What are the rules on hugging now  Guidance in place since March  says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside their household or bubble. If you leave your home, you should “stay at least  metres away from people you do not live with or who are not in your support bubble”. You should also “avoid direct contact and face to face contact with people you do not live with”, and “stay at least  metres away from anyone who visits your home for work reasons.”  What is changing on May   From May , the government will change this guidance for contact between family and close friends. With a third of adults having both vaccine doses, people will instead be told they can choose whether to socially distance from people they are close to. This means people can choose to hug, kiss or shake hands with friends or relatives in the park or in a home. People do not have to take a lateral flow test before hugging, but it’s one way of reducing the spread of the disease. Likewise people could meet outdoors or with the windows open, or wear masks. There is no limit to the amount of time you can spend with people in a day, or the time spent in a pub or restaurant. Itaposs worth noting too that these rules have never been a legal requirement. The legal ban has been on gatherings in the past, not on hugs once youaposre in that gathering. So does that mean it’s a free-for-all  No. Officials say this change is a move towards “living with” coronavirus into the future - and it does NOT mean social distancing rules have been scrapped.Close contact with an infectious person is still the most likely way to catch Covid- and the vaccine is not % effective. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June  - more of this below. Importantly, the new hugging guidance is aimed at people meeting within legally-allowed group sizes - six indoors,  outdoors.

The mum-of-two feared was told her crippling stomach pains could be oian cancer and was forced to make an agonising decision that would change her body forever.Rebecca, , had suffered in agony on and off for  years and was told by GPs she had irritable bowel syndrome, but doctors then advised her to have her oies and fallopian tubes removed.Fearing for her le, she sobbed to her husband Adam after getting back from the hospital then spent hours writing emotional goodbye letters to her daughter Ella, , and son Addison, . On what Rebecca refers to as the worst day of my le in November , the part-time HR officer underwent surgery which immediately plunged her body into surgical menopause at the age of . She was completely unprepared for debilitating hot flushes, night sweats, insomnia and crippling fatigue that followed and felt abandoned. However, a month later she was dealt another devastating blow that turned her world upside down once again. Her surgeon called to explain tests showed she had actually been suffering from endometriosis and fibroids - not cancer. I felt as though I had no choice but to have them removed, said Rebecca, who said a newly qualied doctor told her the symptoms could suggest oian cancer. However, he spent less than five minutes discussing surgical menopause. So nothing prepared me for what I was going to face. The day I had my oies removed was the day my world changed forever. It’s been the most dramatic, tearful, terrying and soul destroying time ever. Surgical menopause never ends my bones ache deeply, I get hot like I could pass out andmy HRT patches run out, I can’t get out of bed due to the pain. And now I want to make sure others don’t suffer alone like I did. Rebecca, from Leicester, explained she was advised by her consultant that having her oies and tubes removed was the safest option. I lost my oies to suspected oian cancer but it turned out not to be cancer, she said.  I can’t really think about what could have been, as I can’t live my le that way. I thought I was going to die, I thought I was going to leave behind my kids. My consultant had told me I had complex oian cysts and a high level of CA, which is produced by some oian cancers. Every year , women are diagnosed with oian cancer in the UK, but according to Cancer Research UK there is no test that reliably picks up oian cancer at an early stage. The two tests currently offered by the NHS include for high levels of CA, but this is deemed unreliable as this can be higher for reasons other than cancer. There is also an internal scan, but there is no clear evidence so far that these tests can pick up cancers early and save lives. Rebecca had suffered with painful stomach issues since she was , but GPs told her it was either IBS, cystitis or was being caused by anxiety.  I have been going back and forward to the doctors for decades, said Rebecca, who relied on strong painkillers to ease the pain. I stopped digging and believed what they told me as they kept saying there was nothing really wrong with me. No one mentioned fibroids or endometriosis, yet I was riddled with it. Rebecca fell pregnant at the age of  and then met her husband Adam when she was  in , but she was left in such agony it took over their lives. We moved in together and on the first night, I remember lying on the floor in the house in agony, she said. It got the point that Adam was reluctant to book holidays or special nights out in case I was too ill. He was getting fed up as everyone was saying it was in my head. But as soon as the pain started, I sometimes couldn’t leave the house it was so bad. After falling pregnant with her second child in , Rebecca found herself doubled over in pain and rushed to hospital at eight weeks.  Doctors wrongly told her it was an ectopic pregnancy - but in fact an oian cyst had burst. I’ve never felt anything like it. I was left for  hours believing I’d lost my baby as that’s what they told me. I had to call Adam to tell him. It was horrendous”, Rebecca said. A scan then revealed all the disbursement from the cyst floating around - it had burst - but it wasnapost thoroughly looked into after the birth. Rebecca explained: I was obviously over the moon that the baby was fine, but looking back, I think the fact I had a cyst should have been investigated more. After Addison was born, Rebecca went back to managing her pain with over-the-counter painkillers and all her energy went into looking after her little boy as he was unwell with suspected pneumonia that was later diagnosed as asthma. Rebecca said she had been to the doctors about her stomach pains, but felt as though she was getting nowhere. They kept telling me it was an infection, or I had pulled a muscle but deep down I knew there was something wrong, she added.  Two months before Rebecca and Adam were due to get married in August , she started to experience sharp stabbing pains in the side of her stomach and feared it was her appendix about to burst. I was on the final countdown to my wedding and I was in agony, said the bride-to-be. I had a huge pain in my side, heavy periods and my stomach was huge one minute and down the next. I was worried I wouldn’t fit into my wedding dress, or that I would bleed through it. But my GP told me there was nothing wrong, so I went ahead with the wedding. I was even in pain on my big day. Three weeks later, in August, Rebecca made an appointment to see her GP as she was determined to finally get some answers. A newly qualied doctor told her the symptoms could suggest oian cancer and she was sent for a CA test in September. When the results came back the next day, stunned Rebecca had to make the agonising decision to have her oies removed and she was booked in for surgery at Leicester General Hospital just four weeks later.  I was crying my eyes out on the way down to surgery. I didn’t want to be put to sleep, she heartbreakingly explained. I came round from the anesthesia and was sick and in pain.Then my body went into surgical menopause. I didn’t know anything about it. The HRT was making me really depressed, and I ended up turning to Facebook groups for help.My doctor told me she didn’t know enough about HRT or surgical menopause. I felt abandoned. I had to take my care and health into my own hands. One month later, Rebecca’s surgeon called her to explain tests on her oies had revealed her suspected cancer was actually endometriosis and fibroids. The operation changed my le for the worse, but at least I’m still here. I could have developed cancer next year and maybe it wouldn’t have been caught in time - I can’t think about ‘what s’, she said. Rebecca believes when it comes to aftercare and information about surgical menopause she has been let down by the health system every step of the way. After her devastating ordeal, Rebecca is now raising awareness of what she has been through so other women are more prepared.

At st and a size , she knew it was time for change but found that while she initially lost weight on a number of popular diet plans it never stayed off for long. Nine years of yo-yo dieting actually saw her gaining st, which impacted her confidence and left her dreading nights out with friends.But after spotting a post from The Munro Method on Instagram Marnie, from Scotland, thought she would give it a go - a decision that has completely changed her le.The programme, which aims to help people lose weight long term with nutritional strategies rather than crash diets worked for Marnie, and sheaposs dropped to st lbs and wears a size . Now , she tells The Mirror: I had just had my twins. Having four kids obviously my body had changed. I wanted to feel a bit better about myself. Other diets didn’t work because they were usually really restrictive, shakes etc, or they taught me nothing about nutrition. So it would be ok for a while when I was doing it but could never stick to it for any period of time and because I hadn’t learned anything then the weight would go back on. It was making me miserable it had totally affected my mental health, I was really anxious and depressed and didn’t really want to go out or see friends. The thought of a night out would me make me anxious all week on the lead up. I was always very sociable, but I started dreading nights out because I was so self-conscious about my weight.  The programme has also seen Marnieaposs entire attitude towards food change, which means sheaposs more confident than ever that it will stick. She explains: “When I joined, I just wanted to lose weight once and for all. I was sick constantly being on a diet. I came across Munro on Instagram. I liked Jasonaposs straight-up attitude. There was no  promises or bulls*** advertising that youaposd lose a stone in a week. I also liked that no foods seemed to be off-limits and that I could fit them into my le rather than it being my whole le. I have  children and a decent social le and previous diets didnapost really accommodate for this.  One of biggest dferences was the community ‘clan munro’ is amazing everyone is so supportive and makes you feel like you’re never alone. “I have a good relationship with food now, I can eat out and know how to fit it into my day or week. I donapost feel guilty about saying yes to cake or takeaways and on the other hand, I also donapost feel guilty when I say no to some things because they donapost align with my goals at that moment in time. My depression has gone, and my anxiety is more or less non-existent. Iaposve gone from sleeping all day to walking - thousand steps a day and I found a love for the gym.  I accept my body and love it for what it has done, and I genuinely have so much confidence now. I went from wearing baggy clothes to wearing sports bras and booty shorts. I feel like a much more positive and content person. I’ve been so inspired by the amazing work that Jason does that I’ve now embarked on my own journey to become a coach and help others. On the new programme Marnie lost lbs in a year and a half, but she wasnapost aposdietingapos throughout. She gave herself breaks to live her le, making sure she allowed herself freedom to enjoy herself on holiday and at Christmas.

I wholly support this initiative. With my own Asian background, I have experienced first-hand the devastating affect mental health has on people when it is a taboo subject – misunderstood, ignored and brushed under the carpet. We cannot allow this situation to carry on because not recognising the importance of mental health has a wider impact on all society. My parents and countless other first-generation British Pakistanis grew up in a culture that doesn’t acknowledge mental health. I remember my own trauma when I realised I might be made to marry someone my parents chose for me. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  It consumed my thoughts as an -year-old. I couldn’t talk to my parents about it because they would have been ashamed of me, and I couldn’t talk to my teachers and friends because they didn’t understand my culture. So I had no outlet for those feelings of fear, anxiety, anger and helplessness. Shockingly, in Pakistan, families often turn to spiritual healers, who associate mental illness with supernatural forces such as witchcraft, possession and black magic.  A child showing signs of misbehaviour or a woman not adhering to the cultural norms would be taken to one of these healers to rid them of the “gin” or evil spirit. The UK has accessible mental health services with more than , registered therapy professionals. Yet many in the UK’s Pakistani communities don’t reach out for help for fear of judgement. In one UK study, middle-aged Pakistani men and older Indian and Pakistani women reported signicantly higher rates of depression than white people. It angers me that the western-educated Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has not used his  to address the mental health of his population, which could in turn have a positive impact on the Asian community here in the UK.

Declan Delaney vowed to have the terried victim murdered and even chillingly pretended he had recruited a hitman to kill her and dump her body at an industrial unit. The teenager had earlier been summoned to Delaneyaposs home after he flew into a rage at her going to bed early instead of visiting him following a shopping trip with her mother. During her ordeal he threatened her with knives, spat in her face, pulled her hair, kicked her, dragged her about the flat and banged her head into a chair calling her nothing but a dog before forcing her to have sex twice.When she pleaded with him to stop Delaney, , added: Iaposve had enough of this, Iaposve had enough of you before calling a man known only as aposNal.aposShe was then forced to listen as Delaney put the call on loud speaker and said: Bro, Iaposve got a job, I need you to bring a van to the car park - make sure you have gloves and rope. Get petrol. Weaposll take her to the usual spot in that abandoned unit, tie her up and leave her.  When the friend seemingly arrived at the scene, Delaney, from Romiley, Stockport, Greater Manchester told the woman: You can save me a job of me killing you, why donapost you just kill yourself now.Iaposll leave you in this room to die, no one will ever find you. She escaped the following day after promising Delaney she would not tell anyone about her ordeal and feigning calls to friends and family saying she was fine when they became worried about her whereabouts.When she arrived at her motheraposs home she was said to be in a pitiable state, dishevelled, injured, hysterical, struggling to breath and in great distress. She told police in a statement: I genuinely believed he was going to kill me and I felt utterly degraded. In the days and weeks following the attack I suffered soreness to her my body plus mental and emotional exhaustion and being unable to comprehend what had happened, constantly reliving the experience. I felt dirty and was washing myself constantly. I couldnapost leave my house for a number of days and couldnapostto work and felt unable to do anything.  I also felt a sense of blame, self-doubt and uselessness. I have felt completely alone and ashamed. I was once a happy, stable, bubbly, outgoing person but I am shy, withdrawn and broken. Heaposs completely changed me as a person. The physical injuries have healed, but the emotional and psychological scars run much deeper, and still have not begun to heal, and I feel that they wonapost.And I will be this person forevermore. I have no escape from what he did to me. Day and night, it haunts me. This is a real nightmare for me that has never ended. I worry that I will never be rid of it. At Bolton Crown Court, Delaney was convicted of two charges of rape,  imprisonment, occasioning actual bodily harm, battery and threatening to damage property.He denied wrongdoing but a jury was told he had previous convictions for beating up and controlling another girl in . In police interview Delaney accused the girl of making apos allegationsapos.But police recovered text messages sent by from Delaney in the run up to attack in which he referred to the girl as a joke, sly, slag, vile, tramp and bitch. One said: I swear to godyou try and take the p**s and not f***ing come. If youaposre saying youaposre not coming, watch. On my sisteraposs grave. Watch what happens. Delaney also had previous convictions for drug trafficking and for a violent burglary at a house in which he and two accomplices broke into a manaposs house and beat him up to make him repay a debt.

Lisa Clarke, from Blackpool, cannot move out of the property because the local authority says it has a shortage of large council houses.The furious mother says the six-bedroom is too small, has a broken boiler and suffers from several leaks, LancsLive reports.However, her local Tory MP Scott Benton claimed Ms Clarke refused to accept council help over the leak and was aposunwilling to engageapos with the authority. Ms Clarke is a mum-of-, who lives at home with  of her children, some of who have special and complex needs. Catrionia is currently the oldest at age  followed by Mackenzie , Kiania , Lucius age , Jaidan , Princess age , Lachlan , Riley and Corey twins  and Malaki  months. The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Lisa also has two grown up children who live away from home who come and help out their younger siblings. Youngest Malaki has started having seizures and recently had an  minute episode where he had to be hospitalised. The twins have been diagnosed with autism and have complex needs as well as Lachlan and Jaden who have learning dficulties. Princess is partially sighted and is also incontinent and Lucius is autistic and has severe ADD. Kiania is autistic and Mackenzie has emotional and behavioural dficulties.  Catrionia has anxiety and is currently unable to work due to childcare commitments. Lisa said she is struggling to cope and has also been diagnosed with autism and has severe asthma. She said the six bedroom house they live on Bairstow Street has become unbearable and has several leaks in the top and middle floor which have not been fixed. The mum also claims there are problems with the boiler meaning that the house is cold a lot of the time. According to Lisa, the sharing of rooms and the use of bunk beds has also become unhealthy and so many children in one room can mean something such as an open window can become quickly dangerous. The property they have lived in since , owned by My Blackpool Home, has no outdoor area meaning there is no respite for Lisa and her children.  She tries to take them to the park when she can, however she does not often get the chance. She claims she has asked the council to be re-housed but was told that there arenapost enough homes large enough for families of this size. Lisa said: I was told there is a shortage of large affordable houses however I have tried to search privately too and there arenapost any. It makes me really angry that so many large buildings become available and immediately get turned into flats. I have known families who because they have eight or less members have been re-housed in weeksthey have an issue.  I would have to wait years before a few of my children can move out. Itaposs absolute discrimination, why donapost we matter  This isnapost about benefits as I am up to date with my rent and bills, this is about a safe house where we can sleep at night. My children have several complex needs and we need a house that meets our needs. We canapost live like this any more. The family was referred to social services to seethey could help in anyway however the outcome was that there were no parenting issues at play however the problems they faced were from where they lived. A Complex Needs officer went to see Lisa who says that the familyaposs biggest issue is health. The officer also stated the option of safe beds, where the children canapost climb out, is usually available however in this case there is no physical space to put the beds.  Lisa feels the only barrier to help is the fact that theyaposre a big family - and she contacted her local MP Scott Benton for help but felt like the answer was to leave Blackpool in order to re-housed. Mr Benton told Lancs Live: My office contacted Housing Options at Blackpool council on behalf of Ms Clarke. Unfortunately, Ms Clarke has not yet been placed on a priority list yet due to a backlog caused by assessing cases. We also raised her concerns regarding a leak with Housing Options. They offered to contact the landlord, My Blackpool Home, who are also council run to remedy this problem. Sadly Ms Clarke has refused their help and is unwilling to engage with them. Housing Options have advised that there is a lack of + bedroom houses in Blackpool, private or social. At no point did my office suggest moving out of Blackpool.

Luke Ashman, , said he started to shake when he realised he had won the National Lotteryaposs Multiplier Orange Scratchcard on April . But the University of Worcester student had to quickly pull himself together before his first meal out with a woman he had been seeing since the beginning of the year. Luke said he aposwon twice in one dayapos as the pair became boyfriend and girlfriend after their romantic night out. He said: “We’ve been speaking and seeing each other since the beginning of the year but obviously haven’t been able to go out on a proper date.

She didn’t believe me at first until I showed her the winning scratch card. That night we went out for a meal, I ordered a bottle of Prosecco and we celebrated an amazing day of both a lottery win and a first date. You could say I’d won twice in one day.” Luke bought the scratch card at an Asda store in Brierley Hill, Dudley. He had to rush to the shop as he fell asleep on the sofa before picking up his groceries. Luke, who works as a security guard for TK Maxx, said: I had the day off from work and even though I was supposed to go food shopping I fell asleep on the sofa.  When I woke, I dashed to the supermarket because not only had I got to get the groceries, I had my first proper date that evening with a girl I’d recently started seeing. “Even after my daytime nap, I was still tired, so I bought myself an energy drink and while at the counter I bought a couple of National Lottery scratch cards.” Luke, who studies criminology, checked the scratch cards when he got back into his car. He added: “I scratched one with no luck. I then tried the second and scratched a diamond, then a win symbol - I saw £, but wasn’t sure whether it was a full stop or a comma. When I double checked and saw the amount and I had won the top prize my heart was thumping and I literally started to shake.

Rescuers tried desperately to save the mammal, named Hattie, after she was rescued from drowning last month, but she was too exhausted and the chances of her surviving in the wild were unlikely. The unfortunate animal was discovered struggling on a beach near Land’s End in Cornwall, on April , after becoming wedged between boulders. She faced drowning in high tide and was found by the Landaposs End Coastguard Rescue Team and charity volunteers just in time.  BDMLR volunteers and the coastguards used rope hoists to free Hattie and, once released, the exhausted seal was carried in a rescue bag and driven to the BDMLR Seal Pup Hospital. Once she arrived, Hattie’s condition rapidly deteriorated however, and tests revealed what was thought to be major organ dys. A spokesman for the hospital said the sad decision to put her down was taken after Hattie began showing signs of a more complex, underlying illness going on. The spokesman added: Some blood tests revealed that she was likely to be suffering from some major organ dys.Hattieaposs quality of le was declining and her chances of recovery from such a major illness and eventual release back into the wild were extremely slim.Hattie had already been identied as suffering a horrendous neck wound that was .in deep from a discarded ghost net that had become stuck around her throat two years earlier.She was believed to be a five-year-old female spotted by Cornwall Seal Group Research Trust in December , with the fishing wire and netting lodged around her neck."},{"url":null,"title":"woman stunned find scary secret","story":"NewsWoman stunned to find scary secret underground basement in storage cupboardTikTok user Abi shared a video of a pitch-black basement she found underneath her storage closet and which she thinks was once inhabited due to artwork being found on the wallsmirrorShareCommentsByClaire Gilbody-DickersonNews reporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video woman-creeped-out-finds-hidden-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:oemtUGr,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Maddie Spahr says she loves her extra skin as it is a constant reminder of how far she has come. The -yer-old hospice nurse and lestyle blogger said she always struggled with her weight and was classed as aposseverely overweightapos from the age of five. By the time Maddie was in her twenties, she had developed a dangerously unhealthy relationship with food, and binged on fast food, snacks and carbs for months on end, followed by crash dieting in an attempt to lose the weight she had gained. However, the weight loss never stayed off for long and at her heaviest Maddie weighed st lb and wore a UK  dress size. The most hurtful comment she received was from people who told her aposyou have such a pretty faceapos since it felt like they were saying that the rest of her body was ugly. The turning point for Maddieaposs weight loss came in October , when attending a Cleveland Indians baseball game. She barely fit in the stadium seat and fans beside her looked visibly uncomfortable by her mere presence. The very next day Maddie made an appointment with a bariatric surgeon and in June , underwent a gastric bypass surgery. A small pouch was created in Maddieaposs stomach, which connected straight to Maddieaposs small intestine, bypassing the majority of her stomach and reducing her capacity to eat lots of food as a result. Over the next  months, Maddie lost an incredible st lb and today weighs st lb, fitting into a UK size  dress.  Since her weight loss surgery, Maddieaposs le has changed dramatically for the better. She is now able to walk for miles without feeling exhausted, can play with her neighbouraposs kids and has even ed to the baseball stadium in which she suffered such embarrassment four years earlier, now fitting comfortably in the seats. After losing so much weight, Maddie has been left with folds of excess skin. Whilst for some, this would be the cause of embarrassment, Maddie loves it, since it reminds her of the amazing journey she has gone on.  She has since started her own blog and Instagram page documenting her journey and has received numerous messages from people telling her that her story has encouraged them to have bariatric surgery themselves which has changed their le forever.Maddie, from Ohio, USA, said: I have always struggled with my weight. I knew that I was an amazing person and always wondered why it was the one thing I couldnapost get under control. I could graduate from nursing school with the highest of honours, I could work thirteen hour shts and I could make friends with anyone.  I always had a smile on my face and always was willing and ready to help anyone with anything but I was so tired of being morbidly obese. I will never forget the looks people gave me. When I would enter a store, especially clothing stores, attendants knew I was too large to shop there, so they just wouldnapost greet me. People wouldnapost hold the door for me at gas stations. It was like I wasnapost good enough because I was in a bigger body and that hurt a lot. The one comment that stung the most was aposyou have such a pretty faceapos. Those words will never leave me. You are basically telling someone who is overweight that the rest of their body is undesirable and ugly. I do have some excess skin, but it is my favourite part of my body.

This happened surprisingly often in my section, Georgia said. She explained: I worked at Primark and there are some stories that still haunt me to this day and this is one of them. I worked in the bra section and one day I had to take out the bras that were in the fitting room and put them back on the shelves. I did my usual, I grabbed a chunk of bras from the fitting room and started putting them out, and as I was walking around I smelt something really, really bad. Georgia continued: It smelt like stale cigarettes and I was getting worried in case someone complained and complained I wasnapost doing my job properly, so I started trying to find what was making this smell. Iaposm still trying to put the bras back really quickly because I didnapost want anyone to complain about the smell until I reached one of the bras in my hand that I had never seen before. Then it clicked, she said. I realised, this was the source of the smell.  Someone had gone into the fitting rooms and switched their own bra out for one of Primarkaposs and the fitting room people did not notice. Here was this bra that wasnapost ours in my hand. Georgia joked: So please always wash your clothes because you donapost know whether theyaposre from Primark or not. I threw the bra away by the way.

The clip, which has gone viral, being watched hundreds of thousands of times, was captioned: How I learned I had been kidnapped. In it, the woman explains that she had discovered her mum wasnapost her biological mother and had been trying to find out more about the person who gave birth to her when she found out the truth.  She says: I think I was -years-old, I was in a healthy place for the first time and I was preparing to get married and I had two children. I assumed that the fastest way to track my biological mother down would be to seek out a criminal record for her. I donapost know what compelled me to call the sherfaposs department in the city that I was born, it just seemed to make sense at the time. I called the sherfaposs department, I gave them the information that I have, the sherf became extremely interested in who I was, my personal information and after a few minutes of having that conversation about who I was he asked me to please sit down, he had something to tell me. I sat down, he told me he couldnapost find any information about my mother, but that I was a missing person. WHAT !  The woman continued: I had been [missing] since . There was a police investigation I could not access because the records had been archived, but I had been kidnapped. So yeah, tough day. In a series of  other videos, she fully explained the story behind her kidnapping, what it was like to meet her birth mother for the first timeand how everything worked out in the end. She claims that when she was a baby, her birth mum sold her to the family that she grew up with, her aposkidnappersapos. Her grandmother had no idea about the sale and reported the child missing to the police and her birth mother even pretended to go along with it - hence why people thought she had been kidnapped.

Oceana Strachan, , had always been out in the sun with tanning lotion on and had never paid attention to those who warned her about the risks of being too exposed. So when she was told a small bump on her leg was actually a form of spreadable melanoma, she said I couldnapost take it in. The model from New South Wales described how the mark first appeared in  but she thought it was just a freckle or a pimple.She got it checked out by a doctor but was told it was of no concern, the Daily Star reports. Oceana interrupted her check-ups during the Covid- pandemic but when the mole started changing in colour and getting darker, she pushed for a dferent doctor to do a biopsy.What are your thoughts on this   Let us know in the comments section below.Devastatingly, her worst fears came true as she was told she had stage two melanoma, which is le-threateningit reaches the lymph nodes.Oceana told the Daily Mail : I have naturally olive skin so I tan really easily and spent most summer days from the age of about  to  in the sun.“So when the doctor told me it was a spreadable melanoma, I couldnapost take it in.” Thankfully, she was able to have surgery to get the .mm mole removed and the cancer hadn’t spread to other areas of her body.  She said: “It sounds tiny, but itaposs still dangerous. “The doctor told me I was really lucky because it didnapost look like a regular melanoma.”Oceana took to Instagram to share a post about her scary experience and raise awareness of the risks of suntanning with no protection the way she did.“I never want to scare anyone from being in the sun or doing outdoor activities I purely just want you guys to be more aware. “I’ve never been the perfect example myself, I’ve had so many people countlessly tell me ‘there’s nothing healthy about a tan’. “And I cringe when I think back to my responses.”  She said she was left swimming in feelings of guilt for what occurred to her, as she always used to dismiss comments about skin with jokes like “you have to die of something”. “I can’t believe those words came out of my mouth, she said. “I’m  and I don’t want to die this young.” The model urged her followers to do regular checks of the skin for any signs of cancer.

Any failure to act will be an endorsement of the votes of your suspended colleagues in favour of this Tory councillor.“This announcement has caused uproar in Aberdeen and, given that the vote will take place this week, I expect an early response and even quicker action.”Mr Houghton was contacted for comment.Last June, after he was readmitted to the Scottish Conservatives, he said: “I apologised at the time and have done so in-person to anyone who has contacted me about the matter.“The comments which led to my suspension were isolated and took place nearly a decade ago.“They in no way reflect my political or professional record and I find prejudice of any kind abhorrent.“I will continue to work and represent my constituents to the best of my ability.”Scottish Labour and council co-leader Jenny Laing were contacted for comment.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium

daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-. Use the dropdown to navigate to your health board. The chart below shows the number of new tests reported each day. This figure shows all tests carried out, regardless of the result.In October, Public Health Scotland released testing data at a regional level.

to Celtic.It was the first time in the club#s proud -year history Aberdeen had failed to score in six successive games.As striker coach with the England squad Russell will be working with world class stars Harry Kane , Raheem Sterlingand Marcus Rashfordat this summer#s Euro  finals.Under his guidance the Reds have rediscovered a goal threat # netting five in the last four games.Russell was quick to praise the efforts of McInnes and his coaching staff for performing #exceptionally well# over their near eight-year tenure.Aberdeen are scoring again and Russell states the fundamental reason behind that new attacking edge is getting more players into the opponent#s box.Yet that is not as simple as it sounds as Russell insists the team structure must be right to allow that to happen.For Russell it is all about the #intricacies of finding space in limited areas# and key to that is building from the first phase by playing out of defence.On how the goal threat has ed, Russell said: #I don’t want to decry the efforts made by the coaching staff who were in here as they have done exceptionally well.#We put more focus first and foremost on getting players into good areas and what that takes.#It takes a team structure, it’s not just players arriving in the box.“It is how you press and build the first phase and second phase which affects the final phase of the game.#That whole process was based on how we can get more bodies in the box and then how we operate in there the intricacies of finding space in limited areas.#Russell has been impressed with how the Aberdeen squad have taken, and acted upon, the advice he and Glass have delivered during training sessions at Cormack Park.He said: “They are an ambitious group, they’re hard-working and intelligent.“They want to learn and be successful.#Russell and Glass may have the Dons firing in front of goal again but their focus during the summer transfer window will be to sign goalscoring centre forwards.No senior striker is signed for next season as the loan deals for Callum Hendry , Florian Kamberiand Fraser Hornbyall expire at the end of the campaign.The squad assessment by the new management team is ongoing but Russell recently confirmed the door has not shut on any player being part of the squad next season,  including the three loan strikers.Hendry is the top performer of the three loan centre forwards having scored three times, including the opener in the - defeat of Livingston.Kamberi has netted once whilst Hornby has yet to score although the Scotland U international has struggled with a thigh problem.Aberdeen#s only signed striker Bruce Anderson is currently on loan at Hamilton and his Pittodrie contract expires at the end of this season.It is understood Glass is keen to retain Anderson.Although the attack is firing again Glass and Russell suffered their first set back in the Dons dugout when losing - to Dundee United in the Scottish Cup quarter-final at Pittodrie recently.It was a hammer blow as the tournament is wide open following the exit of Premiership champions Rangers and cup holders Celtic.However Aberdeen rallied from that set-back to overcome Livingston to secure qualication to the Uefa Conference League second qualying round.The defeat of Livingston also kept the fight to finish third in the Premiership alive.Aberdeen now trail third placed Hibs by just three points and will face the Edinburgh side at Pittodrie on Wednesday in a must win clash.Russell, , said: #We have given ourselves a chance of third and we challenged the players at half-time against Livingston.“It was important for everyone to go into the last two games with something to play for and we will be doing our utmost to get that third place.“We want to finish the season positively.#Should Aberdeen defeat Hibs on Wednesday the fight for third will go down to a showdown with Rangers at Ibrox on the final day of the season on Saturday.Rangers boast a % record in the Premiership at home with  wins from  and have scored  goals whilst conceding four.Following the completion of the season Russell will join the England squad at their training base in preparation for the Euro  finals.The Dons No. has been a key component in England manager Gareth Southgate#s coaching staff since being appointed in .When he does meet up with the England squad he is confident the Dons# rebuild will already be well on the way in time for the new season.Glass and Russell have already secured three signings in Motherwell captain and Scotland international centre-back Declan Gallagher, Celtic skipper Scott Brown and keeper Gary Woods.Oldham Athletic keeper Woods is currently on loan at Pittodrie until the end of the season and has started the last two games as No. and club captain Joe Lewis is out with a rib injury.Woods# deal with Oldham expires in the summer and he has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen permanently in the summer until .Russell said: #I think us coming in for this last month or so will bear fruit next season.#It helps us to assess the environment, to assess the players and to put in our processes and principles, based on the outcome of our assessment, really.#It will give us a head start going into the summer.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 16 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Of course, this has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a very dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for wildle.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Our pretty Highlander girls have lost all interest in us now that the grass and rashes are a vivid, succulent green. They graze far and wide, ignoring their hay ring breakfast bar where they jostled and queued all winter.The sheep roam around the cattle’s hairy feet, no longer mooching for scraps from their breakfast table. So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It involves GPs, nurses, an army of health professionals and lots of support staff. It is essentialwe are to achieve what the publicsay is a priority, enjoying a healthy le. As the founders of the NHS said: #From the cradle to the grave#.Hiding in plain sight in this report, in the small print, is this statement: #Politicians, health care professionals and the public must all be involvedour primary care system is to survive.# As Oprah Winfrey would put it, #WHAT # If this is what is at stake, why have we not heard more about it  Why was it enough to contact so few people among our erse population Why has health management locally cast our group out in the cold We are open to all and represent a wide cross section of community interests. And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May.

The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy.

Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team. I would love another goal and I love the Scottish Cup. I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

We cannot manage what we cannot measure, which is why it is often left out of the carbon equation.:Claire Taylor: Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureThis could all be about to change. Last week saw the launch of a global farm metric ndash a common benchmark to measure the sustainability of food and farming. I attended a TEDx event hosted by the Sustainable Food Trust which is leading a new coalition to establish a standardised approach for assessing the sustainability credentials of dferent farms. A common toolkit which will be rolled out internationally and will allow us to present a harmonised approach to measuring and managing agriculturersquos global emissions.Finally, the role our grasslands play in storing carbon will be properly recorded and recognised for their valuable contribution towards our journey to net zero emissions. It is now up to the next Scottish Government to embrace this global farm metric and start recognising farming as part of the solution.Farming practices will have to change to be part of this journey and I believe from speaking to farmers and reading the manestorsquos of dferent farming organisations that they are ready and up to the challenge, but this sht in production will require long term commitments over future funding.If farmers are going to be tasked with producing more environmentally friendly food which comes with a higher price tag, this has to be reflected in the value of food or  farmers will continue to need subsidies in order to keep food affordable for the public.Farmers today are producing food which is sold at the same price as it was  years ago. The same certainly canrsquot be said for the price of clothing, petrol or house prices.If we as consumers really value a future where low carbon produce becomes a staple in our shopping baskets, then we might have to start footing some of the bill.We all go into our local supermarket with the moral intentions of choosing food which supports good animal welfare and boasts environmental protections, but % of us go in and buy based on price.Food is cheap and we are so disconnected from the way it is produced that we often donrsquot value it and think nothing of throwing it away. Why  do we allow % of UK food to end up in the bin But are we lazy consumers with a disregard for seasonality and the origins of our food, or is it simply that we are overwhelmed by too much choice on the shelves that we canrsquot begin to understand the impact of our purchases :Claire Taylor: Blue Peter has no right to push an anti-meat agendaWe all might recognise a free-range egg label or red tractor assurance mark, but do we really feel equipped to make informed choices on the sustainability of our purchases  I back the proposals by the Scottish Greens and the SNP to introduce carbon labelling, but will it not all ultimately come back to a case of price During the TEDx event, the Chief Executive of Morrisonrsquos explained: ldquoChoice often means the balance between price and quality, price and provenance, price and healthier ingredients, but it always comes down to price.Morrisonrsquos have a clever solution to remove the pressure from consumers and place the onus on themselves to provide sustainable produce on their shelves. In March they announced that they would only be supplied by net zero carbon farms by  and will be working with their  farmers and growers to produce affordable net zero carbon meat, fruit, vegetables, and eggs. This takes away the uncertainty and ambiguity for its customers.As a nation emerging from a pandemic with rising levels of poverty and social inequality, we cannot expect the public to be putting sustainability at the top of their list, but longer term the responsibility will have to be shared by consumers.We as the public need to play our part in tackling the climate emergency and committing to responsible food choices is a good place to start. We need to start valuing the produce on our shelves and nipping in the bud the throwaway culture which has resulted from our disconnect.There is an urgency to rebuild our relationship with food and our understanding of how it Is produced. All roads lead back to education, and by introducing sustainable food production as part of the national curriculum will equip the next generation with the knowledge to make responsible food choices.Constitutional issues cannot be allowed to dominate and ide discussion over the next five years. A collaborative approach is needed to properly address and tackle the looming climate emergency and how our food is produced, purchased, and consumed has to be front and centre of policy decisions."},{"url":null,"title":"nancy-drew-frankensteins-monster-author-monique-roffey-discusses-books-shaped-life-work","story":"Favourite book you read as child All the Nancy Drew mysteries excited meand then all my brothersrsquo Willard Price books enraptured me .What was the first book to make an impact on you Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.

His success in photographing these notoriously shy creatures lies partly in his ability to blend silently into the seascape, becoming indistinguishable from a rock or clump of weed.Yet on a subliminal level, Howard appears to speak the animalsrsquo language. ldquoYou have to think like an otter to succeed in photographing or spending time with them, he says.The Highlands-based naturalist has just published The Secret Le of the Otter: a book filled with astonishingly intimate images of the creatures at rest, at play and at war. Getting close enough to capture them fighting, gambolling and even mating is incredibly rare.Of Howardrsquos three wildle photography books, this is the one hersquos proudest of because it was the hardest to produce. ldquoOtters are elusive in the extreme, he says. ldquoTheir incredible shyness combined with hyper-aware senses and natural camouflage has made them successful survivors.:Line of Duty proves appointment TV is not deadOtters have inhabited Scotlandrsquos lochs, shores and rivers for at least , years, yet their nocturnal habits and wary natures have made them shadowy presences, often accorded magical qualities in myths and legends. At one time, people debated whether they were fish, canines or amphibians: early clerics are said to have argued over whether or not their flesh could be eaten during Lent.And although they were hunted for sport and for their pelts until the practice was banned in , these enigmatic creatures seem always to have been regarded with affection. They were once trained to catch fish or turn fireside spits for their human masters, and there are records of them being tamed like puppies during the th century.Andy Howard treats them with respect rather than amiability and having spent a day on the hills watching him photograph mountain hares, Irsquom struck by his contrasting approach to the two mammals.With hares, he maintains a constant, low chatter as he looks them in the eye and clicks the shutter, sometimes addressing them fondly by name. ldquoWhen photographing hares, you want them to see you, hear you and be aware of you, he says now. ldquoWith otters, you donrsquot want them to know you are there at all.There are no pet names in his new book, in which he describes his relationship with the animals as one of ldquokinship. What does he mean by that  ldquoThe thing I like about spending time with otters is that I have to be as secretive as they are, in a way. I have to be furtive and become part of their environment to succeed with them. So I find myself quite often behaving like an otter.:Northern Ireland at : Growing up in a land of dreams and terrorHe prefers to work on stormy days, when ldquothe wind masks the sound of my shutter, and hersquos not afraid to immerse himself in brine in order to catch the ldquosuper-low, otterrsquos-eye perspective that brings the viewer right into the animalrsquos watery world.Rapt in concentration while photographing a mother and her cubs, he once lost his footing and tumbled backwards off the rocks and into the sea. ldquoI remember looking upwards to see green bubbles racing to the surface, only just managing to struggle ashore.His subjects ndash whose likenesses were obliterated by the salt water ndash seemed unperturbed by the dripping cameraman flailing around trying to retrieve his equipment. That day, Howard appears to have completed his transmogrication into a sea creature.An otter once got close enough to snf his boots another dosed happily in his presence after hersquod spent five or six days quietly observing it while camouflaged among seaweed. ldquoIt had grown to take me as a part of the landscape and would walk past quite nonchalantly within a couple of metres then roll about or curl up and sleep. I actually started talking to it ndash just whispering to see its reaction. It seemed to accept the fact that I was gently talking to it.When I catch up with Andy Howard, Covid- restrictions mean I canrsquot join him in his preferred, Hebridean snapping ground. So this morning, keen to observe an otter in the flesh, I preceded our phone interview with a mini-safari along Glasgowrsquos White Cart.:Celebrating Archie Brennan, innovator, pop artist, adventurer and former Mr ScotlandPrevious generations of Glaswegians would have been unlikely to see otters on rivers flanked by factories, mills and engineering works. Otters prefer clean waters and during the s, over-use of pesticides combined with industrial pollution and other factors drove them out of many British waterways. Some died as a result of toxins in their food chain and their numbers plummeted by %.Since the s, however, the ban on agricultural pesticides such as DDT, along with de-industrialisation and legal protections against culling, have led to a healthy resurgence and there have been several recent sightings along the now decontaminated White Cart.Unfortunately, however, my morning wildle-spotting expedition gleaned nothing but some ducks and an old fox scratching its fleas. Where did I go wrong  ldquoYou didnrsquot go wrong at all, Howard reassures me. ldquoItrsquos the luck of the draw. Otters have a great ability to blend in with their surroundings, whether it be the bank of a river in Glasgow, a peat hag in Shetland or some seaweed on the island of Mull.The fact they often float with just their eyes and nose above water makes them virtually invisible. ldquoWhen they are in the water, especially a river, they almost become liquid themselves, says Howard. ldquoAnd the way they move makes them very dficult to spot unless you have a really well-trained eye.Because they hunt mostly at night, their black, tarry droppingsalong with half-eaten fish, crabs or lobster, are often the only signs of their presence and ldquothe best opportunity to see them is when theyrsquove actually caught something and theyrsquore sitting on a rock or on the foot of a bridge, eating their dinner.Another trick, says the otter-whisperer, is to listen. Having determined that an environment is ldquoottery, hersquoll sometimes drive around with the windows open. ldquoI often hear otter cubs before I actually see them, he explains. ldquoTheyrsquore quite vocal.:Teddy Jamieson: Do we really need a Festival of Brexit Can he describe the noise they make  ldquoIrsquom not good at impressions, he laughs, ldquobut itrsquos a very high-pitched whistle thatrsquos designed to cut through the air. The natural sounds surrounding otters are quite low-frequency ndash waves crashing, trees rustling. A cubrsquos high-frequency whistle pierces through all the other sounds, giving the bitch otter a chance to catch up with it or find itthe family becomes separated. They are very good at communicating with each other.Late one evening, Howard was startled by a pitul screeching and followed the sound to discover a distressed mother otter whose cubs were being summarily killed in front of her by a male. Otters are territorial with males guarding a range of up to km. And while females often live together in family groups, dog-otters are solitary, communing with others only to mate.On this occasion, a marauding male had apparently taken over anotherrsquos territory and was ensuring the survival of his own genes. In his book, Howard explains that ldquobeyond her terrible trauma, the bitchrsquos body would respond by ing rapidly into heat, and the dog would be close at hand to impregnate her.Howard got no pictures that day ndash partly because the light was poor but also because of the emotional impact on him. ldquoIrsquod read about it happening but never thought Irsquod be in a position to witness it, he says now. ldquoAnd in a way I felt privileged to have seen such a raw, brutal element of the le of the otter. People that have studied otters for their le and work have never seen that happen.ldquoNature is quite cruel at times, he adds. ldquoItrsquos all part of the process ndash and yes, it was an upsetting thing to witness.Hadnrsquot he been tempted to intervene  ldquoI didnrsquot really know what was going on until it was too late, he says, though in any case, approaching a frenzied otter could be dangerous. For all their cute faces and ldquohumanlike qualities, these are wild animals with strong jaws and teeth designed to crunch through shell and bone. Howard once met the late TV naturalist Terry Nutkins, who in boyhood had lost two fingers to one of Gavin Maxwellrsquos otters while working as his assistant in the western Highlands.Maxwell did much to popularise the image of the otter as a cuddlesome, furry friend. In his bestselling  book, Ring of Bright Water, he described sharing his home, his bath and even his bed with the creatures. ldquoIrsquom not sure that sits comfortably with me, says Howard. ldquoMuch as I appreciate Gavin Maxwellrsquos writing, Irsquom not an advocate of people removing animals from the wild and keeping them as pets.In fact, the photographer takes the opposite approach, interfering as little as possible with the animalsrsquo natural habitat and presenting readers with a privileged insight into a world in which the human presence has ostensibly been obliterated.Most of the Secret Le images were captured around sea lochs and he often visits a location several times before taking any pictures. ldquoThat way you get to know the animalsrsquo inidual characteristics:they fish at low tide, high tide, where they like to sleep. It means I can be in position, waiting for the otter to come in.Howard conducts wildle photography tours and his top tip for clients is to be patient. ldquoThe more time you invest, the bigger the reward. With otters especially, the moment often comes towards the end of the time you allocate to spend with them. If I just bide my time, it should reward me in the long term and usually that does happen. Otter karma is something I teach my clients: donrsquot push itit doesnrsquot happen itrsquos not meant to be. If it is supposed to happen it will happen and therersquos always another day.And when the stars align, clients have sometimes been moved to tears. ldquoItrsquos such an emotional thing, to have a close encounter with an otter, says Howard. ldquoThatrsquos what drives me ndash itrsquos like a drug. Delving into the secret le of an otter is almost voyeuristic. So highly tuned are the animalrsquos senses that managing to get close enough to take nice pictures without it having any sense of being watched, gives you an adrenaline rush. Therersquos no doubt that my clients and I get high on it. Then you crave your next fix.The Secret Le of the Otter is not intended as a scientic text but a ldquocelebration of the species. Howardrsquos first book may well have been influential in bringing about a parliamentary ban on the mass culling of mountain hares and he hopes this one will have a similar legacy in terms of awareness-raising, so that people will ldquofall in love with the animals ndash thereby helping to ensure they are respected and protected.Of all the beautul images in his book, Howardrsquos favourite features a pair of white-tailed eagles, swooping down on an otter that had just landed its catch. ldquoTo get one eagle with an otter is fairly unusual to get two is pretty special.Inevitably for the photographer, as for the fish-hungry otter, there is always the one that got away. He dearly wanted to include an image of an otter eating a lobster and one evening, he watched through binoculars as one surfaced,  metres offshore, with a pair of distinctive red antennae hanging from its mouth.Howard made for the otterrsquos most likely landing ground and switched on his camera, only to find that the battery was dead. ldquoSo I had to sit and watch that otter eat that lobster ndash one of my dream images. It was lovely to watch but I could have almost cried.ldquoWhether it will happen again for me I donrsquot know. Crsquoest la vie, though. You canrsquot stress out or get angryyou miss a shot. You just have to hope itrsquoll come round again or something similar will come along.ldquoAnd inevitably, it does, he says, demonstrating his carefully honed otter karma.The Secret Le of the Otter by Andy Howard is published by Sandstone Press, pound.FAMOUS OTTER STORIESCuthbert and the OttersOtters are referred to as ldquowater dogs in Celtic folklore, and generally portrayed as helpful, friendly creatures, providing fish or firewood to people in need and even warming their feet, as in the story of St Cuthbert ndash patron saint of otters. A Celtic monk living at Lindisfarne during the seventh-century, Cuthbert was reputedly fond of taking nocturnal walks along the seashore. One night, a curious colleague secretly watched as he waded into the sea right up to his neck and began singing psalms. As dawn broke, he ed to shore, whereupon two otters came up and warmed his cold wet feet with their fur. Cuthbert blessed them, and they ed to their holts.Ring of Bright WaterGavin Maxwellrsquos celebrated  memoir describes his le in a remote cottage at ldquoCamusfearna , and the two imported otters he kept there as pets. He sourced his favourite ndash Mij ndash in Iraq and brought him to the UK during an eventful plane journey that saw the creature chewing its way out of its box and running rampage around the cabin. Maxwell fed the animal on bucketloads of collected eels, walked it through the streets in a custom-made harness and allowed it free rein of his London and Scottish homes where it frequently pierced visitorsrsquo ears with its teeth. The story was partially fictionalised in a  film adaptation and for a generation of children, the scene involving Mijrsquos brutal dispatch, at the end of a road-diggerrsquos shovel, was a tearjerker on a par with the shooting of Bambirsquos mother.Tarka the OtterThis  novel by Henry Williamson recounts the le story of an otter cub that becomes separated from its mother and wanders the North Devon countryside alone, until it eventually fathers a family of cubs of its own, before being killed by the local otter hunt. As a boy, Andy Howard watched the  film version and was ldquoterribly upset by Tarkarsquos demise, ldquoas most children should be."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12582787.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ultenic-u11-cordless-vacuum-cleaner","story":"A budget vacuum cleaner with clever features and plenty of accessories.Good points Costing almost pound less than similar models from other manufacturers, the U provides enough cleaning options to be comparable with premium brands.Among its most notable features is the Ultra Carpet Boosttechnology which automatically detects the type of surface being cleaned and adjusts power accordingly.UCboost means you no longer need to turn off roller brushes when transitioning from carpet to harder floors or having to press a boost button when moving to a thicker pile rug.

It mirrors the health of our economy, as cranes in the sky and diggers in the ground are indicators of buoyant times. However, despite its importance, our talent pool is dwindling. This is concerning, given the Scottish construction industry would have to increase current recruitment by over , new workers each year to deliver against current project pipelines.The reasons behind the skills gap are complex. The construction industry has suffered from outdated misconceptions and is often assumed to be male-dominated, manual, dirty work. When projects do not go to plan, contractors are often blamed, regardless of the context which negatively impacts the industry.Macro-issues also have a role to play in the erosion of talent. The  financial crash resulted in the industry losing a generation of workers, graduates and apprentices who were forced to look at other sectors. Fortunately, the Covid crisis has not had the same devastating impact a recent report from Addleshaw Goddard found that  per cent of businesses in the sector reported their cashflow positions were secure or very secure, indicating optimism.There are several ways we can rewrite the narrative about this fast-paced, vibrant industry and attract more people to it. The first is education. Here at GRAHAM we support schools, colleges, universities, and employability organisations to raise awareness about the roles within our industry. The range of opportunities is vast, from traditional trade work to opportunities in design, planning and commercial management to graphic design and HR.At site level, we must educate and continuously train as the industry is evolving quickly. Construction can be intensive, however off-site fabrication, technology advancement and better working conditions, coupled with well-structured technical apprenticeships and targeted vocational qualications offer the potential for a fulfilling career.We must then look to retain our people and hone their skills via continuous improvement. Our employee development programme provides a framework for us to invest through mentoring and tailored in-house training, allowing people to draw from the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience within our business.We know that strong female representation creates a more erse, sharper workforce, so attracting and keeping women in construction is key to sustained success and growth. Girls outperform boys on maths and science-based subjects until they reach secondary school ndash the question is why this changes later. We continue to break down gender stereotypes by encouraging girls to look more closely at Stem subjects when we visit schools and by supporting initiatives such as Ayrshire College Girls into Construction.Finally, we need more construction champions. Funding for apprenticeships and training is crucial however endorsement from people in positions of influence and power is invaluable. A campaign of positive messages about construction as the leblood of the Scottish economy will reinforce it as an industry that benefits us all and will help us to promote it as a positive career destination.Craig Bridges is Strategic Director for GRAHAM"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-sunday-letters-imperative-fans-allowed-return-scottish-football-waiting","story":"This has now become intolerable,  long months after the World Health Organisation confirmed that this virus does not transmit outdoors.

But fine words, plans and targets wonrsquot do the trick on their own. For example, the target of six weeks waiting time for some diagnostic tests hasnrsquot been met since . As with most things, it boils down to money. Cancer services were already stretched to the limit and Covid is likely to have made things much worse. There is a need for a major increase in trained staff to tackle the tsunami that is about to hit. Perhaps the Prime Minister will be able to ring fence that weekly poundm that we no longer send to the EU. Think how many additional laboratory staff could have been employed for the poundm ldquospaffed by the Chancellor on Eat Out to Help Out.Read more:Elections: Old time politics were enriched by the lost art of hecklingAlthough the threat from Covid is receding, the NHS is still in danger of being overwhelmed by the backlog that has built up over more than a year. We all have a role to play and prevention is always better than cure. Covid underlined the importance of fitness and general good health in avoiding infection or making a full recovery. Cancer Research UK has also repeatedly warned of the causal link between alcohol, smoking, obesity and cancer. As we emerge from the pandemic there is a golden opportunity for UK and Scottish governments to emphasise and support personal responsibility for lestyle and health. That makes the national obsession with reopening pubs even more bewildering and suggests we have our priorities all wrong. It seems more important to get the pubs open before gyms and other sporting facilities. It would have been more appropriate had party leaders queued up to be photographed at their local gyms rather than pouring pints down the Dog and Duck. It appears to be a patriotic duty to get down the pub to freeze under a brolly and blanket and consume a burger and chips washed down by six pints of overpriced lager.Itrsquos a pity that there hasnrsquot been similar urgency in getting people to exercise parts of their bodies other than their drinking arms. We havenrsquot seen the last of SARS-type infections and our resilience will be greaterwe are fitter and healthier. Some have suggested draconian ldquonegative incentivisation, placing the obese and those with smoking and alcohol related conditions at the back of the queue for medical treatment. While that would be morally and probably legally questionable, action is required to address the obesity epidemic that is as threatening for the NHS as Covid.

Surrounding me were local women heading to the nearest market town. Clutching baskets on their knees, they were dressed in much the same way as their grandmothers and maybe even their great-grandmothers.I sat silently in my corner, pretending to read. We were only a few miles from Bath and yet, as the other passengers talked among themselves, I might as well have been in Bulgaria. I could not understand a word.Their speech was a rolling burr with a treacly intonation, but I will never knowthey were discussing Coronation Street or the Common Agricultural Policy. In terms of communication, it was a verbal hawthorn hedge, keeping eavesdroppers at bay. ROSEMARY:Is it time for a Jilly Cooper-style Holyrood bonkbuster Much has been said about the decline in regional accents and dialects since the First World War, butthese women were talking in a diluted version of an older tongue, God help incomers who moved to these shires before the days of the Somme.I was reminded of this the other day when the painter-decorators were in our loft. Making the best of a rainy week to get on with indoor jobs long-postponed by lockdown, they rollered on the matt emulsion at lightning speed, despite having to stoop beneath the eaves.This pair have known each other since they were boys. As they worked, I occasionally heard them chatting. The sound was a breath of pure Borders air, as blown from the direction of Galashiels.For such a small region, the iation in accents is pronounced. If you have a linguistic ear ndash sadly I donrsquot ndash therersquos no mistaking someone from Jedburgh with a native of Selkirk or St Boswellrsquos.As with so much of Scotland ndash and the rest of these isles ndash many folk are bi-lingual, speaking conventionally when theyrsquore with those like me who are from where, and the rest of the time in their natural voice. The Scottish education system can take much of the blame for ironing out peoplersquos range of expression, but thatrsquos another discussion. ROSEMARY GORING:Dont let politicians kill the dream of a place in the countryAll this was on my mind when reading Rory Stewartrsquos travelogue, The Marches. His account of walking -odd miles along the English-Scottish Border in  was an attempt to understand the mood of the region and the make-up of those who live here.Since previously he had trekked across Afghanistan in winter, this venture was relatively untaxing. Despite its once formidable reputation as a lawless no-manrsquos land, the present-day Marches were unlikely to pose a mortal threat, unlike that which he faced from suspicious and sometimes trigger-happy Afghanis.Walking is Stewartrsquos default state. This is a man who, when getting off the train in Dunblane, thinks nothing of hiking the final  miles to his family home. On the page he is great company, even though I donrsquot always agree with his conclusions. What he found in the Borderlands, however, was curious. In his view, there are three distinct localities: the area south of Hadrianrsquos Wall, the territory between the wall and the border, and the land immediately on the Scottish side of the line.Reluctantly, he reached the conclusion that in the Scottish Marches, not only can very little be found of the traditional way of le, but also few iniduals whose roots go far back. ROSEMARY GORING:Its not just the squirrels who are coming out of hibernation, we are tooldquoI didnrsquot meet a farmer in Roxburghshire whose family had been on the same farm for more than three generations. Many had moved there relatively recently, from Lanarkshire or the edge of Dumfries a hundred miles away. Despite the efforts of voluble local schoolteachers and antiquarians, it was dficult for me to feel any organic links here between the modern population and the distant past.As he trod the hills, moors and dales, Stewartrsquos focus was on the land. He concluded that a distinctive personality remains in the two English districts abutting Hadrianrsquos Wall ndash tourism in the Lake District, and remote, small-scale farming by families whose lineage in the area goes back centuries in the zone known as Bewcastle.The Scottish Borders, in contrast, were ldquodramatically modern. Farming was large-scale, mechanised and, by implication, soulless. The overwhelming impression he took away was that agriculture here was a commercial business, not a calling or an inheritance. Something similar, in terms of size, greets visitors to Dumfries and Galloway, where Irsquom always surprised by the industrial-scale dairy farms. These massive enterprises ruin the fond illusion of countryside filled with pocket-sized farms using age-old techniques.Should you ever want to learn the reality about the past half-century of upland hill farming in Britain, James Rebanksrsquos memoir English Pastoral is an unbeatable guide. Having taken over the family farm in Cumbria, he is now working to revive and restore acres almost destroyed by pesticides and over-production. It is a laborious and precarious enterprise, yet rewarding on many levels so long as he doesnrsquot hope to get rich. ROSEMARY GORING:Lockdown spirits lt at the sight of spring lambsWhile Stewartrsquos take on Borders farming might well be accurate ndash I donrsquot know enough about it to contradict him ndash the communities around Hoolet are filled with people whose forebears have been in these parts for ages.Whatrsquos also noticeable is how porous this society is. Newcomers are welcomed, despite our accents. Indeed, half or more of Hooletrsquos residents originated from far away. Even so, there is still a bedrock of rootedness, a sense of todayrsquos Borderers holding a direct connection to yesterdayrsquos.I was struck recently by a journalist who was writing about ldquoold families such as his. By this he meant wealthy, landed, entitled. But every family in the world is old. Itrsquos just that most of us have not traced our ancestors, or inherited a gallery of portraits to remind us of them.Nevertheless, in the Borderlands the old and once feared surnames are still all around: Grahams, Armstrongs, Kerrs, Ridleys, Elliots, Taylors, Homes, to mention only a few.

Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest.

One or two Tories mutter privately that such an initiative might have been handy before the election, not after.The Prime Minister will also face pressure to spell out whether he would consent to indyref.

It is a scenario that will be familiar to many Scottish voters, for this has been the  Days Later election for these pandemic times.Anything that involved coming within two metres of a stranger was out of the question . So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV. Channel rsquos Krishnan Guru-Murthy came all the way from London town to show us he was as familiar with Scottish politics as Donald Trump was with third-wave feminism.The televised debates were missing a live audience in the studio, and turned out to be horribly dull in consequence. Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater ided the debate work between them, though Steve Arnott-dress-a-like Harvie hogged more of the limelight.Anas Sarwar adopted a ldquoWhy canrsquot we be friends approach to the debates, albeit the offer clearly did not extend to the Conservatives, who were the focus of everyonersquos attacks. Douglas Ross seemed spectacularly cross in most of the encounters, while Ms Sturgeon tried hard not to look humongously smug or bored.Election day arrived, and with it the chance to exercise that age-old right to take a photie of the dug at a polling place and post it on Twitter.The one million Scots who had registered to vote by post had already done their bit, quietly and without fuss, in keeping with the mood. In one final insult from the heavens, the counts were not starting till the morning after, so voters were denied the thrill of spending the night with Kirsty Wark and Bernard Ponsonby.It had been that kind of election, that kind of year.

Unitersquos Len McCluskey complained: ldquoPeople donrsquot know what his vision is. People donrsquot know what Labour stand for anymore.Meanwhile from the partyrsquos centre, the wily Sultan of Spin popped up to insist the defeat in his former manor of Hartlepool was down to the long shadows of Covid and Corbyn.Lord Mandelson, who admitted to ldquomild fury at the by-election defeat, declared: ldquoWe have not won a general election in  years, and pointedly noted: ldquoWe have lost the last four with  a catastrophe. The last  general elections read: lose, lose, lose, lose, Blair, Blair, Blair, lose, lose, lose, lose.Brexit doubtless had an effect, particularly in Hartlepool, where more than % of voters had opted for Leave. It is clear the tranche of voters, who Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party won over, chose to support the Tories rather than Labour.But Brexit was not the only reason for the Conservativesrsquo wins. Time and again as the electoral dust settled, voters in northern England insisted they had for years been taken for granted by Labour. Sound familiar Northerners insisted Labour politicians had not listened to their concerns while the Tories went beyond the old Left-Right ide and put community investment at the forefront of their campaign.The real fear for Sir Keir and his strategists in Labour HQ must be that what happened to the party in Scotland over two decades is now happening in northern England. Those areas, once described as heartlands from the industrial past, have lost heart with Labour.:Anas Sarwar: Labour to form credible alternative to SNPOne Opposition frontbencher admitted the by-election result had sparked ldquofull-on panic among Labour MPs, fearful their seats could be at risk at the next general election.Wales was a dferent story. Mr Drakeford defied the pollsters and led Welsh Labour to gain  seats, equalling its best ever result, and ensuring its -year unbroken run in power will continue. The dferent outcome for Labour in Wales simply underlined how this has become a disunited kingdom with voters across three nations taking dferent approaches to the choices before them.Of course, Conservative consolidation south of the border will only play into the Nationalist narrative north of it that Scotland and England are increasingly drting apart politically and there is only one solution to resolve this.It is intriguing how, in England at least, while Labour has increasingly become a metropolitan party, attractive to Remainer students and well-to-do English middle classes but lost touch with northern England working class communities, the Tories have begun to appeal to poorer ldquoRed Wall towns, many of which backed Brexit.Birmingham MP Khalid Mahmood, a Shadow Defence Minister but perhaps not for long, derided the ldquoLondon-based bourgeoisie, backed by ldquobrigades of woke social media warriors, that had ldquoeffectively captured the party. Sir Keir, London-born and Surrey-raised, is MP for Holborn and St Pancras.Centre Right Labour peer Lord Adonis branded him a ldquotransitional figure and claimed: ldquoLabourrsquos problem is it has had weak or terrible leaders since Tony Blair stood down  years ago and until it gets an electable leader, it will keep losing elections.The name of northerner Andy Burnham, the Manchester mayor, is already being whispered as a future leader.Sir Keir now faces a major rethink and reset, that will involve a frontline reshuffle, an overhaul of policy and a drive to reunite hisparty.Labour needs fundamentally to find and set out a clear, bold mission statement for Britain in the st century. We could see some familiar faces, big hitters like Yvette Cooper and Hilary Benn,to the frontbench.The mountain Labour has to climb to win power in, perhaps, just two yearsrsquo time, is of Everest proportions so much so that a pre-election pact with the Liberal Democrats looks increasingly possible as the only means to stop a fourth consecutive Tory term.

But it is only now, as wersquove seen it happen, that the potential crisis has become actual.The UK Government insists there is no case for another referendum on independence because we had one in . Boris Johnson has even suggested that the gap for Indyref should be the same as between the first and second referendums on Europe:  years. But this has been a holding position and is no longer sustainable. Ciaran Martin, the former UK Cabinet Office civil servant who oversaw the  referendum, says this rejectionism is an offence against democracy itself. If the independence parties win another majority, he said last month, ldquothere is no legitimate justication on which to resist a referendum.:Johnson invites Sturgeon to Team UK four nations summit after election victoryIt is true there were other issues in this election campaign besides the referendum: education and the pandemic for starters. But no-one in Scotland could have been in any doubt about what they were voting for on Thursday. When they placed their crosses on the SNP and the Greens, they were voting emphatically for Indyref. Scottish voters must themselves now take responsibility for their actions. The very size of the turnout has upped the constitutional ante.The Scottish Tory leader, Douglas Ross, claimed that Nicola Sturgeon was planning an illegal ldquowildcat referendum. That is untrue. She has always said that the only referendum she would agree to is a constitutional, legally-binding one authorised by Westminster under a Section  Order. This is for a very good reason. Only such a referendum would be regarded as legitimate by other countries ndash especially the European Union, which the SNP is eager to rejoin. Only a legally-binding referendum would put the result, as she put it, ldquobeyond doubt or challenge in the eyes of the world.Which doesnrsquot mean she will simply accept the Westminster veto. Ms Sturgeon made clear in the Channel  leadersrsquo debate that she intends to go to court herself. She will ask the Scottish Parliament to pass a referendum bill and then defy Boris Johnson to reject it. Assuming he does, the Scottish Government will then challenge this ruling in the courts. Irsquom not entirely sure this will succeed, and Irsquom not entirely sure she thinks it will either. The Supreme Court would ultimately rule on the matter, and it seems unlikely that the United Kingdomrsquos highest court would actively support the dissolution of the United Kingdom.But that isnrsquot really the point. Court action would be constitutional theatre designed to increase the moral pressure on Boris Johnson to offer a plausible referendum timetable. There was speculation last month that he might actually do this. Ministers had, it was reported, considered holding a snap referendum to catch the SNP unawares.Support for the SNP may remain stratospheric, but support for independence has been waning somewhat. Nicola Sturgeon has had dficulty explaining the new border and currency issues that arise with independence post-Brexit. So why not put the question now, while the SNP is on the back foot I donrsquot think therersquos much risk of this happening. Boris Johnson may have won the Brexit vote, but he is very wary indeed of referendums. He saw what happened to his predecessor, David Cameron, who thought the  referendum would be a walk-over for Remain. The  referendum was a near-death experience for the British state. Referendums are highly unpredictable, and rarely just about the narrow question on the ballot paper.Indeed, a second Scottish independence referendum could easily turn into a referendum on Boris Johnson himself ndash a figure who is profoundly unpopular in Scotland. The Scottish Conservatives barred him from appearing in the election campaign, even though the PM had said that ldquowild horses couldnrsquot keep him away.:Iain Macwhirter: It was an SNP landslide, but dont expect an early IndyrefWe have heard much about the Governmentrsquos plans for massive investment in Scotland on roads and rail links, even a bridge or tunnel to Northern Ireland. But such pork-barrel initiatives are unlikely to answer the fundamental question. If the UK Government is to repeatedly reject the clearly expressed will of the Scottish people to hold a referendum, how can it reasonably claim to be a democracy  Continuing to reject it would transform the Union from being a partnership of nations into a coercive union, based on legal force.Piecemeal reform, such as the Smith Commission in  that tinkered with tax powers, and gave a mendacious assurance that the Sewel Convention was inviolable, will not do. There has to be a recognition in Westminster that Scotland is now in charge of its own destiny. I believe there are ways to achieve this and retain the only union worth saving: one that is a free and equal partnership of nations.The devolution era is over. Power devolved is power retained, and events since Brexit have confirmed the wisdom of that dictum. The federal boat, however, has also sailed. England would never agree to the upheaval involved in creating the constitutional paraphernalia of federalism: regional parliaments, a federal executive, a president of the UK. They are quite happy with the Parliament theyrsquove got. What might be possible is a form of asymmetrical federalism that the late Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, used to call ldquoindependence in the UK and the SNP called ldquofiscal autonomy.All tax and spending powers could be devolved to Scotland, with Holyrood sending back a percept, a kind of fee, for common services like defence and currency. This would end the Barnett Formula and give full economic responsibility to Holyrood, but retain the social and cultural links with the rest of the UK. It would largely fulfil what was envisaged by the SNPrsquos  Independence White Paper: a ldquonew UK with a common currency, borderless trade with England, and the retention of UK institutions like the Crown and BBC.This would be a radical departure, however, not dissimilar to the way countries like New Zealand and Canada acquired quasi-independence in the s in the sterling area. The evidence is pretty clear that England, which following Hartlepool is becoming more Tory and more nationalist, would not object. It would mean Scotland taking charge of the money issue and ending what has been called Scotlandrsquos ldquodependency culture.For their part, Scottish nationalists are beginning to realise that independence is no walk in the park now that Britain is out of the EU. No-one wants a hard border with England, but one is now inevitable.Independence in the UK would create a new Union held together not by legal constraint, but by consent. I have no idea whether Boris Johnson has the will or the imagination to seize this opportunity. I rather doubt it. But even he must realise that doing nothing is no longer an option.

From the  Treaty of Iona when Highland chiefs had to agree to send their heirs to English Protestant schools, through to ious education Acts which discriminated against the use of the Gaelic language, speakers have been punished and disrespected with predictable results. The same dismissive approach has generally been taken towards the ious Scots dialects.We are so fortunate that Scots Gaelic has not disappeared completely. Its daily use may sadly be hugely diminished, but the culture of the Gaeltachd through music, poetry and dance ndash not to mention language courses through the Gaelic College, UHI and the excellent Radio nan Gaidheal and BBC Albandash has been really encouraging, strengthening our Celtic links with other Celtic nations.We should treasure it and, where possible, bring it back into daily le. Im not a Gael but, for example, why should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names  Whether in school, broadcasting or in Parliament, it would be a small but signicant step to use peoples Gaelic names. People would soon get used to them rather than view them as something to be avoided, just as they are becoming used to the names of \"newer\" generations of Scots originally from dferent cultures.The good work done to give Gaelic names on street signs, town signs and public vehicles are not, as some people would have it, confusing, but of real interest to all Scots as well as our tourists. The everyday usage of peoples Gaelic names would add to this. Likewise, many Scottish dialects are also threatened through \"homogenising\" our language. As a consequence, we lose so many words that provided colour and local identity. Some local authority schools may be more accepting of language ersity, but private schools perhaps not.Those who do not take an interest in Scotlands cultural history and the preservation of it, should broaden their minds and start to have a bit more respect for the positive role that the languages and dialects have, rather than head towards a \"monoculture\".Andrew Turnbull, Perth.TIME TO LISTEN TO RURAL SCOTSWHILST your Letters Pages are full of concerns from those living in the Central Belt, why is it that the vast array of wind turbines and HV pylons that desecrate rural Scotland receive no attention  The First Minister may well criticise Boris Johnson, but at least Westminster has extended democratic rights over wind farm applications to rural England. Why then do Central Belt politicians refuse to grant the same rights to those in rural Scotland A good move by Holyrood in listening to rural Scots would be a decision to run the HV cables in the GlenKens of Galloway underground, closely followed by a decision to set up two National Parks in southern Scotland to balance those north of the M.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.GREEN CLAIMS DONT STAND UPGREEN electricity should be electricity that is generated  per cent from renewable sources, not fossil fuels. Several major companies claim to supply \" per cent green electricity\". This is impossible since fossil fuels generate a large percentage of the electricity sent to the grid.A report by consultancy firm Baringa in partnership with ScottishPower and Good Energy shows that as little as three per cent of the power supplied by green providers is \"genuinely green\" they have asked the Advertising Standards Authority to investigate. Could the claim of \" per cent green electricity\" be termed \"greenwashing\" which is similar to \"whitewashing\", but used exclusively by the green brigade Clark Cross, Linlithgow.* JOHN Flemingclaims that I am unaware that wind power can be used to electrolyse hydrogen. He is obviously unaware of the sheer cost and unviability of this idea in the context of trying to power a huge industrial economy like the UK.Other people in his shoes claim that batteries are the answer. But the worlds biggest batterywould only provide the UK with energy for a theoretical maximum of . seconds. I cant find the cost of Gateway but its undoubtedly at least  million. I dont have data for hydrogen from electrolysis but its surely in the same ball park.Geoff Moore, Alness.* JOHN Fleming should note that any process connected with renewable energy, and now with that latest fad ndash the storage of electricity ndash is always presented as being feasible and just needing a bit of money to perfect.

Add into the mix the two most prominent politicians in recent Scottish political history fighting like ferrets in a sack where one faced criminal charges and the other, the current First Minister, found by a parliamentary committee of having misled parliament.Therefore and unsurprisingly perhaps, the SNP put independence front and centre of its campaign rather than its failed domestic policies which simply do not stand up to the slightest level of scrutiny. Further, the eternal promise of independence and the land of milk and honey galvanised SNP support and made it a one-issue election.It has become clear that the supposed unionist parties, Conservative, Labour and the LibDems, were taken in hook, line and sinker by the SNP tactics and got continually dragged into the constitutional question rather than providing any focus on the SNP domestic record and the solutions that an alternative government might provide. Nicola Sturgeon must have a huge smile on her face at the lack of any real and meaningful interrogation of her record.Therefore the oppositionrsquos other opportunity to rein back the SNP was to adopt some sort of agreement around tactical voting, but even with that opportunity, personal party politics triumphed and yet again they looked inwards rather than working together for the benefit of the Scottish people.There was a little evidence of tactical voting where the Dumbarton constituency was held by Jackie Baillie for Labour benefitting from Tory votes and Galloway and West Dumfries was held by Finlay Carson benefitting from Labour votes. However the real question and indeed the failure of the three unionist parties is why they did not do more to blunt the SNP  It is worth looking at just a small number of constituency results to evidence this point.In Ayr, the sitting Tory MSP John Scott lost to the SNP by  votes. Labour and the LibDems could not even finish second here but polled , votes. Angus Robertson won Edinburgh Central by , votes. Labour and the LibDems polled , votes with no chance of winning. The SNP won Banffshire and Buchan by  votes whilst yet again Labour and the LibDems, with no chance of winning polled , votes. East Lothian went to the SNP by , votes with the Tories and Lib Dems polling , votes. Aberdeen South goes to the SNP by , votes with Labour and the Lib Dems polling , votes with no chance of winning.Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie have simply and contemptibly denied the supporters of the Union any chance to hold the SNPrsquos feet to the fire in sorting out the domestic issues, of which there are many, facing the Scottish people. They should be ashamed of themselves for their feeble and inept campaigns and their defence of the Union.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.JUST WHO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH SINCE the turn of the year I have received six election statements from the Conservative Party, all of them assuring me that the only way to stop indyref was to vote Conservative. These were all in the name of Douglas Ross and, sometimes Ruth Davidson. At the same time I occasionally heard the UK leader of that party assuring me that, under no circumstances, would he agree to a second referendum.I could not decideMr Ross and Ms Davidson did not believe that their leader was telling the truth orthey were just wilfully misinforming the electorate. I concluded that I could not entrust them with my vote.Ken MacVicar, Lesmahagow.I CAN FORGIVE THE SNP NOTHINGIRONIC, is it not, that the SNP has a landslide victory when it cannot stop landslides on to the A  I find the post-election triumphalist display by the SNP, of an increasingly-defeatist attitude to the duty of maintaining our Treaty of Union, is demoralising on many levels.The unceasing lack of thankfulness to the UK Government for organising both Covid vaccine sourcing and the emergency job-saving furlough scheme are just two instances of what I see as the insipid nature of the SNP belligerence and misappropriation of praiseworthy responsibility.As a unionist I can forgive the SNP nothing, for I have now witnessed everything from its fiscal incompetence to an education policy which Victorians would endorse. Those who would shatter the UK seem to forgive it everything, for I believe they have selective blindness like a fawning lover.I consider that the SNP has promoted stress, anxiety and ill health among those of us who again fear we may loose our citizenship of the UK with its embracing family of nations.The possible loss of Scotlandrsquos security which is implicitly underwritten and assured by the Act of Union has only one international trade effect ndash it puts investors off. However,the separatists are successful in destroying our Union, one thing history has taught us is clear those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind.Bill Brown, Milngavie.ARE the nationalists simply trying to wear us down  They are charged with responsibility for running that which has been devolved.

You have no need to fear anything, Mr McKay, have confidence.Sandy Slater, Stirling.LABOURS DEMISE SELF-INFLICTEDKEVIN McKennarsquos opinion piece on Saturdaywas an accurate analysis of the reasons for the Labour Partyrsquos decline. The cracks in Labourrsquos foundations were there even at its electoral high-water mark in . Soon after Tony Blairrsquos landslide that year, there was a by-election in Paisley South and three of us from Stirling Labour went through to help Douglas Alexanderrsquos campaign.We teamed up with a minibus-full of students from St Andrews University to canvas Foxbar. From a distance, the housing reminded me of the area where I grew up, Mastrick in Aberdeen, but close up it was clear that it had been allowed to deteriorate very badly some of the students were visibly shocked to see such conditions in the UK. There were no Labour posters in windows in Foxbar, but there were for the SNP.Over the next decade, I campaigned for Labour in some of its other strongholds. I was struck by the number of housing estates, managed by Labour councils for decades, that were run-down and depressed. I hoped that Labour governments at Westminster and Holyrood would launch a housing programme to provide decent, warm homes for families and to create jobs but Labour was more interested in playing Cool Britannia and building white elephant aircraft carriers.Sir Keir Starmer, a London lawyer and knight of the realm, talks about Labour being the party of ldquoworking people, which doesnrsquot wash any more. ldquoWorking people, or the working class, is no longer one relatively homogenous group. There arenrsquot great hordes of men rushing out of shipyard, mine or factory gates at the end of their sht, and few private sector workplaces remain unionised.Labourrsquos dficulties are largely self-inflicted. After decades of dominance in its strongholds, Labour assumed that people would continue voting for them even when it demonstrated that, in power, it really didnrsquot care about their priorities. Eventually people tired of being ignored, their welfare overlooked, and decided that they might as well take their vote where.New Labour was a fantastic concept: with a solid working-class core, all it needed was support from a relatively small number of centrist and middle-class voters to win a landslide. But in moving to the centre it lost its core voters, who expected rather more than crumbs from the table, drted away and arenrsquot inclined to .

You win some, you lose some. Itrsquos just what happens. Thatrsquos football. You donrsquot want VAR do you It was a mature response to a bitter disappointment ndash the striker and his Fir Park team mates had fought back from being - down to level and taken the last eight match to extra-time and then spot kicks - and a definite injustice.The former Airdrie, Celtic and Hearts forwardrsquos viewpoint is shared by many players, coaches, officials and fans in this country. Those who have witnessed how VAR has adversely impacted on the game in England are vehemently opposed to its introduction here.Atmospheres have, pre-coronavirus when grounds were full at least, often been killed by the innovation. There have been interminable delays as officials have deliberated over rulings. The excitement has been sucked out of many matches as dramatic goals have been chalked off minutes later. There has been controversy and confusion over the consistency of the decisions.There was another almighty stooshie surrounding the technology at the weekend when Manchester City played Cha in a Premier League match at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday evening.City winger Raheem Sterling was adamant he was fouled in the Cha area by centre half Kurt Zouma with three minutes of regulation time remaining. Television replays clearly showed contact had been made three times. But referee Anthony Taylor took no action after consulting with his colleagues.ldquoI couldnt get a shot off because hes put his knee on the back of my hamstring,\" Sterling told Sky Sports later. \"I dont know how its not a penalty, I dont know how its not been reviewed properly. The ref said it had been reviewed. I thought the VAR was here to help.Marcus Alonso netted in added on time to give the visitors a - triumph that increased their chances of finishing in the top four as their hostsrsquo title celebrations were delayed.Yet, Sterling was only on the park in the first place because VAR had ruled that his foul on Timo Werner wasnrsquot worthy of a red card. His studs had been up and he didnrsquot look completely in control. He was fortunate. It is an almighty mess and no mistake.But the Scottish Cup semi-finals between Hibs and Dundee United on Saturday and St Mirren and St Johnstone yesterday would have both benefitted greatly from the use of VAR.Jack Rossrsquos men were worthy winners at the end of their encounter with Micky Mellonrsquos charges. But for the second round in a row they scored an offside goal which should have been disallowed.Christian Doidge was a yard beyond the last United defender when Martin Boyle played him through. A quick review of the incident would quickly have shown that beyond any doubt and match official Bobby Madden could have chalked the strike off immediately.Then in the second semi-final of the weekend yesterday Willie Collum ignored a blatant foul by St Johnstone defender Jamie McCart on St Mirren forward Kristian Dennis in the first-half and a potential hand ball immediately afterwards. Jim Goodwinrsquos men ended up losing -.It is to be hoped there are no similar incidents in the final on Saturday week. They will mar what has been an excellent competition.UEFA use VAR in the latter rounds of both the Champions League and the Europa League. But it is only deployed in four obvious match-changing situations when there is evidence of a clear and obvious mistake - goals, incidents in the penalty area, red cards and mistaken identity.It is a less pedantic system which causes far less angst among protagonists and onlookers. Scottish clubs have certainly had few complaints in the past when it has been called upon in Europe.Copenhagen were awarded a spot kick after Ryan Christie of Celtic handled at a corner last season and Rangers centre half George Edmundson also gted Bayer Leverkusen a penalty. There were no arguments on either occasion.VAR can, when used sensibly, aid match officials, improve the quality of decision making and even enhance a game as a spectacle. It is needed in the modern game, when every flashpoint and flare-up is filmed from numerous dferent angles and pored over endlessly by online agitators, despite what its detractors claim.The Video Assistant Referee is far from perfect. But it is a work in progress and should not be dismissed while it is being perfected. The International Football Association Board have asked officials not to be ldquotoo forensic after listening to complaints from across the globe in the past few seasons. Hopefully their advice will be heeded.Many feel that bringing VAR into Scottish football would be a waste of money which could be better spent where, not least at grassroots level. The game here is hardly awash with cash. But it will, at some stage in the not-too-distant future, get the go-ahead. Used correctly, it can benefit referees, improve games and protect the overall integrity of the sport."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-nicola-sturgeon-won-now-need-changes","story":"You got that  Itrsquos about the people. Of Scotland. The people of Scotland.But who are the people of Scotland and what did they say exactly  In her speech, Ms Sturgeon said the SNPrsquos re-election for a fourth term was extraordinary and she was right. All the precedents tell us that, after  years or so, people get fed up with the party in power and give the other guys a try, and yet the SNP, after  years, and a persistently poor record in office, has attracted nearly half the vote. Itrsquos not supposed to happen this way, and yet it has.However, in acknowledging the SNPrsquos achievement, we should also look a little closer at what the First Minister said in the speech because thatrsquos how we can compare it to what actually happened in the election. The dferences between the two ndash what Ms Sturgeon said, and what happened ndash reveal some of the linguistic techniques the First Minister and the SNP use. But they also reveal what needs to changewersquore ever going to break the current deadlock.First, the ldquopeople of Scotland stuff. Irsquom assuming Ms Sturgeon bases her right to speak for the people on the pro-independence majority at Holyrood. As the First Minister pointed out, the SNP won a record number of the constituency seatsand, even after the adjustment for the list votes, the SNP and the Greens have  of the parliamentrsquos  seats, or % ndash a majority.However, the SNP and the Greens have a majority of the seats based on a minority of the votes. The SNP won .% of the constituency vote and the Greens took .% ndash or % combined. The Tories, the Lib Dems, and Labour, on the other hand, took .%. You might see this as just nit-picking over a clear win for the nationalists ndash and they did clearly win under the current system ndash but the result means two things. First, when Nicola Sturgeon claims to speak for the people of Scotland, shersquos really only speaking for .% of them at most. And second, we need a better system, based on how people actually vote.The need for a better system, I hope, would be obvious to any fair-minded voter. For a start ndash although it ultimately failed ndash at one point Alba looked like it might be able to do a bit of jiggery-pokery with the list vote to articially boost pro-independence representation. But the other lesson of the election is that many pro-UK voters felt they had to vote tactically, and many did so with positive results. Some unionists see that as good news, but unionists shouldnrsquot have to vote tactically to get fair representation. It is another argument for a better, more proportional system, ideally single transferable vote.Similar problems apply to Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks about another referendum. A referendum, she said, was the will of the people and anyone who tried to stop it would be standing in direct opposition to the people . But the assertion is based on the same logical flaw that .% represents a settled will . You might also assume the .% that voted Tory, Labour or Lib Dem do not want a referendum. In any case, the idea that another vote on independence is the will of the people is a distinctly dodgy claim.Perhaps the change thatrsquos needed here ndash on top of a better system ndash is a referendum that ensures the result does actually reflect a settled will rather than the SNPrsquos version of it. The SNP is demanding a referendum on .% and would claim a victory in the referendum on .%, but both, to some extent, are a distortion of whatrsquos going on. One way to stop it would be to require two-thirds for a referendum win ndash at least, that way it would ensure talk of ldquowill of the people had a better basis in reality.But even thatrsquos not the end of the changes we need because Ms Sturgeon also talked a lot about the Tories . Scotland, she said, was facing many more years of right-wing Tory governments and could choose a more progressive alternative. These are familiar comments and part of an attempt to portray the border with England as an unbridgeable gulf. The Scots, she says, are utterly dferent from the rest of the UK, therefore the SNP, therefore referendum, therefore independence.But the SNPrsquos argument runs into the same old ldquopeople of Scotland problem. Ms Sturgeon speaks about anti-Tory Scotland in the same way she speaks about the will of the people, asScotland were one entity that speaks with one voice. But Scotland is Liberal Caithness where my mother grew up and Tory Aberdeenshire where I grew up and itrsquos old-school Labour Ayrshire where I live now. Yes, the SNP dominates, but perhaps Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech could have acknowledged that Scotland is not one thing and that half of the country didnrsquot vote for her. Such an approach would have shown more subtlety, reality, and ndash dare I say it ndash humility.But what did we get instead  A speech based on a logical flaw and fuelled by anger, arrogance, and, I suspect, a bit of disappointment that she didnrsquot get an outright majority. But then maybe thatrsquos the last thing that needs to change: Nicola Sturgeon herself. The talk before the election was of building momentum and an SNP majority that Boris Johnson couldnrsquot say no to, and the SNP certainly needs such momentum before it can achieve another referendum and win it. A stand-still election like the one wersquove just had will not do.But to achieve such momentum, Nicola Sturgeon will need to convince voters who didnrsquot back her ndash the .% ndash and they are unlikely to be chuffed by talk of the ldquowill of the people. They might be impressed, though, by something more realistic and honest. There is no ldquowill of the people, there is only a people ided, andNicola Sturgeon acknowledged that, and started talking about it, maybe she would have a better chance of changing it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In the  and  elections, the Labour Party won the most seats and obtained the most votes, but they did not get an overall majority as a result of the voting system. Indeed, in the history of the Scottish Parliament, Scottish elections have only ed a majority once, when the SNP effectively broke the mould in .Scotland is ided into  constituencies and each constituency elects one MSP. The way that this MSP is elected is the exact same method as elections in Westminster - using First Past The Post .The Additional Member System , based on the German mixed-member proportionalsystem, is used in Scotland and is signicantly more proportional than FPTP. Such an election system is known as a hybrid electoral system. AMS means that the overall number of MSPs elected for each party is roughly proportional to their electoral support.The second vote is used to elect  additional members that will complete the political landscape of Holyrood. Scotland is ided into  parliamentary regions and each region elects  regional MSPs.DHondt method in Scotlandrsquos Additional Member SystemRegions are elected by proportional list via the DrsquoHondt formula.Scotlandrsquos system is designed to limit the winning party using the DHondt method in the additional member system. It is sometimes described as the highest average method. The principle of this idea is that a partys vote total is ided by a certain figure which increases as it wins more seats. Thus, as the party becomes bigger in the parliament, the partys total in succeeding rounds gets smaller, allowing parties with lower initial totals to win seats and effectively make establishing a majority much harder.In Scotland, the list vote is ided into the number of constituency wins in the region +. This means that by winning more constituencies, you need a signicantly larger list vote.In simple terms, the more constituency seats a party wins, the fewer list seats it will win.:Gordon Brown launches pro-Union campaign aimed at middle ScotlandA proportional system The Scottish Parliament typically works in a proportional way using the DrsquoHondt system, with the share of the votes aiming to closely mirror the share of the vote. And it has been relatively successful in doing this once again in .The SNP obtained just under half of the vote, and has just under half of the available seats. The Scottish Conservatives, who campaigned on the List vote, or peach vote mainly, secured .% of the vote and won % of the seats. Labour had a list voteof % of the regional vote - which translated into % of the seats. The Scottish Greens won % of the vote and obtained % of the available seats in the chamber.SNP fall one seat short of an overall majority in Scotlandrsquos parliamentary elections - in a system designed to make majorities all but impossible - but with the Greensrsquo  seats, a clear majority of MSPs are in favour of Scottish independence pic lneEcBdXAThe list vote is arguably a better indicator for proportion of the parliament given the increase in tactical voting at a constituency level, with voters effectively lsquolending their votersquo to the party with the best chance of stopping the SNP.In  the SNP won a majority for the first and only time so far in Scottish Parliament history through losing out on more constituency votes but being propped up by regional votes. The party won  of seats at a constituency level but a high regional vote saw them obtain  list seats.  years on they have upped their constituency wins to  but only picked up  regional seats as a result.Do Westminster Governmentrsquosmajorities General elections are exceptionally likely tomajorities for one party, but once again this is due mainly to the voting system and not due to the percentage of the vote.For example in the  General Election, the Conservatives won a majority and a mandate for Brexit with .% of the vote - however as the system was less proportional they obtained % of the seats in parliament.To further simply, the majority voted against the party which won the election and ended up with the majority in the House of Commons.Does a majority indicate a mandate for independence The constitutional battle raised by the Scottish election is one for the politicians to argue over - however, early indications seem to imply that Westminster will rely on the constituency majority backing the union and the failure to secure a majority to oppose Indyref.Judging the Scotland results by whether @theSNP wins a majorityseems a rather unionist prism. Scotland looks set to have clearly voted for an even more pro-independence parliament than before.In a host of interviews over the weekend, Michael Gove said the failure to secure a majority meant that the UK Government was not considering a second independence referendum. He said ldquoThe majority of people who voted in the constituencies voted for parties that were opposed to a referendum with the SNP obtaining .% and Scottish Greens obtaining .%.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Michael Gove: Scottish independence referendum would be a massive distraction\",\"description\": \"Michael Gove: Scottish independence referendum would be a massive distraction\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media RyJPmQ poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests RyJPmQ.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Looking at the regional vote share, while the SNPrsquos list vote fell by .% to .%, the Scottish Greens obtained .% and Alba obtained .% givingpro-independence parties a .%at the regional list level.Many critics have also pointed out that the Conservatives used the  election as their mandate for Brexit but secured less than half the vote.

She says that the last  years have seen numbers fall, with the most rapid declines being recorded in the last decade.ldquoNot everyone is aware of how badly populations have been affected, she says.ldquoIn some areas it still looks asthere are thousands of birds, while in other places they have all but disappeared.The first step to tackling the issue is raising awareness of the problem amongst those who can help to fix it and that means working with rural communities to change the timings of, amongst other things, grass cutting regimes.ldquoWithout the sort of cover that they get from long grass the birds are much more at risk from predators, says Jessica.Other steps include not rolling fields in spring, so that nests are not destroyed.Changing practices is not always straightforward but Jessica says she has been delighted by levels of engagement amongst farmers, including making lsquoscrapesrsquo ndash shallow ponds that are dug out by a digger and remain damp all year round, allowing insects to breed and offering feed for waders.Being able to offer small grants to help with this kind of work has proved to be very useful and other habitat management work includes cutting rushes and carrying out pest control.The public too, says Jessica, have a part to play by keeping dogs under control and Working for Waders is reinforcing the Access Code through promoting local signage that explains the breeding season of the birds and what dog owners can do to protect nests and chicks.ldquoOystercatchers, like all waders, nest on the ground which is why keeping dogs away from them during nesting time is so important.Some waders, including GoldenPlovers, make the journey to Scotland every summer, heading for moorlands to breed before flying back again before winter sets in.Redshanks, meanwhile, can be found around remote streams and wetlands, although these are getting harder to spot with their numbers declining % in  years.NatureScot, Scotlandrsquos Rural College, the RSPB, the British Trust for Ornithology, the James Hutton Institute, the Game and Wildle Conservation Trust and others have all joined forces in Working for Waders to put in place additional measures that they hope will help to improve the chances of the birds.This way of working follows the recently adopted Shared Approach to Wildle Management a collaborative model which brings all sorts of people together to develop action.Working for Waders is also open to ordinary members of the public to share their knowledge and enthusiasm to help tackle the decline of wading birds across Scotland. And the project, which was launched in , is continuing to capture the imagination of increasing numbers of people who have a shared interest in ensuring that the distinctive cry of the lapwing and the lonely call of the curlew donrsquot disappear from these shores.Just recently Working For Waders received a generous donation that allowed it to buy  trail cameras that are helping its members to understand the successes and failures of the waders across Scotland.These cameras have been distributed to farms across the country including the Isle of Skye, Speyside, Galloway and the Borders ndash all of them once home to large populations of waders.These cameras will be used to monitor what will hopefully be successful breeding seasons and help to inform watchers about the problems faced by these birds as part of a citizen science project that could make a positive impact on the future of some of Scotlandrsquos most important bird species.For more information visit: www.workingforwadersThis article is brought to you in association with NatureScot."},{"url":null,"title":"cabinet-office-minister-michael-gove-refuses-rule-legal-action-indyref2","story":"The Cabinet Office minister, who is in Scotland this week, twice refused to give a straight answer on the point in a briefing with journalists.On Sunday, Mr Gove gave a series of ambiguous answers to the question on TV shows, saying he didnrsquot want to discuss the possibility of a Supreme Court challenge.Asked point blank todayhe was ruling out a challenge, he dismissed the issue as ldquotheorising and ldquoabstract debate and tried to change the subject, but did not deny it was a possibility.After the SNP won a landslide fourth term in last weekrsquos Holyrood election, Nicola Sturgeon said she would press ahead with Indyref when the Covid pandemic allowed.The First Minister has said she wants the vote by , thenindependence in .In a phone call with Mr Johnson on Sunday, she told the Prime Minister another referendum was now ldquoa matter of when not , despite his previous refusal to allow it.Asked about the FMs remark, Mr Gove said: ldquoOur focus is purely and principally on recovery at the moment.

Faced with having to take time off work to attend a local council office and request a special letter to let them vote, people will simply stay at home.mdash Electoral Reform SocietyMay , ldquoVoting is safe and secure in the UK, meaning this policy is just an unnecessary barrier to democratic participation. Ministers need to listen to these concerns and drop these costly plans.ldquoMillions of people lack photo ID in this country. These proposals will make it harder to vote for huge numbers of voters, locking ordinary people out of our democracy and unfairly discriminating against those who lack ID.Sam Grant, head of policy and campaigns at Liberty, said: ldquoMillions of people in the UK donrsquot have photo ID, and the vast majority of them come from communities that are already marginalised and under-represented by our political system.ldquoMeanwhile the Governmentrsquos own findings show our current voting system is safe and secure.

They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need.

There was a huge amount of rope and all sorts of litter.“Beyond that there was general litter such as Coke bottles, beer cans, and a few face masks. The only odd thing we found was a massive oxygen tank.”Highlighting the volume of rubbish encountered during the clean, he added: “Nearly everyone who came along was from the community and they had seen this litter building up over the last two years.“The beach clean is an annual event we tend to do in April but we had to cancel last year’s so this year is basically two years’ worth including two winter storms’ worth.”When asked how much of the responsibility for the mess he believed lay with local people, he went on to say: “Some of the litter will certainly be from local industry but so much of it will be dropped from people on the island – whether locally or swept in.“The problem is not just local to here, it’s a UK-wide issue.”Addressing the challenges facing the village more broadly, Mr Watson said: “On Friday one of our contractors pulled up two trailers of fly-tipped metal down the side of one of the bridges away from the beach.“That has been years’ worth of local people dumping bikes, climbing frames and all sorts of bits and pieces. Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents.

Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3787297.jpg--.jpg?1620288585000\n","title":"seth raises 1340 for great cause","story":"A Ballymena teenager has raised more than pound for Macmillan Cancer Support after completing a half marathon at the weekend.

I also received reports of the system crashing, forcing people to restart the process,” the DUP MLA said.“This is all indicative of a system under signicant strain.“Previous announcements in relation to priority booking for those with theory test certicates were welcome, but this does not appear sufficient to deal with the overall problem.“If the Minister is still confident in her plans then she should publish the data in relation to the number of people attempting to access the booking system, the number of tests currently being allocated and the number of customers passing their theory test who are also coming onto the system.“There are young people who are unable to take up employment opportunities because they cannot obtain their driving licence.“Delay will only make the situation worse so the Minister should revisit her plan quickly and outline steps to ensure people can obtain a driving test within a reasonable period of time.A spokesperson for the Department for Infrastructure said: “The Driver and Vehicle Agency’sdriving test booking system opened to all customers at am this morning, Monday  May. Statements claiming the system crashed are not correct. As anticipated, there has been signicant demand for bookings and while there were some technical issues, which resulted in the queue being paused for a short period of time, these were quickly resolved.The online booking service remains open and we are pleased that thousands of customers have successfully booked an appointment today. The queue management system will remain in place to manage the demand and keep the system working.DFI remains committed to minimising disruption and ensuring the DVA’s plan for the restoration of services is in hand, however, all driving test services across these islands are experiencing high demand with longer than usual waiting times and we would ask customers for their continued patience as we continue to work hard to keep our staff and customers safe.”Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Glenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Top VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest Northern IrelandEU ‘must stop punishing Northern Ireland over Brexit’Minister pressing Casement Park’s potential as World Cup venueRoyal Irish reserves to deploy to the Falkland Islands next monthMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageBBC NI closes three Radio Ulster programme Twitter accountsLatestOne-metre plus social distancing rule may be scrapped next month, PM suggestsDo not throw caution to the winds, PM urges as hugs to be allowed againMP and newly-elected council leader to ‘earn every penny’ despite criticismRachel Riley tells court of job fears after Corbyn aide’s ‘dangerous’ tweetClimate campaigner accuses court of ignoring evidence on Heathrow expansion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In both quarters, and reflecting typical patterns, % of those were filed by wives.The NI High Court bulletin also shows that in the second half of , there were , petitions filed, up % from , in the same quarter of .But in the year overall, the number of petitions filed was down % from , to ,.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDivorcees by council area:  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueDivorcees by council area: Unreasonable behaviour is the third most common ground for orce in Northern Ireland and encompasses problems such as violence, excessive drinking or drug use, emotional abuse, aggression and inappropriate relationships short of adultery.Lenore Rice cautioned that it was “too soon” to conclude that the rise in petitions was due to the problems faced by couples in lockdown.But she said the practice was receiving more enquiries about break-ups, adding: “Our instructions level is the highest it has been in a long, long time.“We’re getting lots of online and telephone queries. In terms of cases that we’ve opened, it has signicantly increased.“When we look at new files opened, we are seeing quite a few same sex couples and civil partnerships separating.“Predominantly, women are making the initial queries. They want to seek advice, to prepare, they like to get their house in order before they act, which is a very sensible approach.”Ms Rice said lockdowns had put pressure on relationships.She added: “I think before the pandemic, people were not used to spending quite so much time together. The stay at home policy meant people worked at home together, lounged around the house together, then ventured out once a day to exercise with that same person.“While some people appreciated that aspect, it could prove mentally and physically suffocating for others, especiallythere’s any relationship problems. There’s nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide.“Before the pandemic, for example,you had an argument in the morning, you’d usually go to work, get distracted, maybe get a bit of perspective and cool off a bit. By the time you arrive home, it might be easier for you both to calmly resolve the issue and ‘hug and make up’.“However,you’re in the same place together and you don’t even have time or space to think and process your thoughts, you feel restricted and maybe even powerless. It becomes a pressure-cooker environment.“Then when you add to this existing tension, maybe the stresses of home-schooling, maybe restlessness and boredom, with no social outlets, that person or couple don’t really have any space or time to handle the issue.“You could go upstairs to the bedroom to ring your mum and give off about your other half, but it may not do much to change it.”Violence ensued in the worst cases, leading to applications to the court for an order to keep the spouse away from the home, known as a non-molestation order.“People are maybe drinking more. Domestic violence is a big issue.“We’ve had a lot more non-molestation orders and quite a few injunctions brought by men we’ve had to apply for.“Again, there is a lot more stress because of the stay at home policy. Where do you go, where’s open, where can you run to  For example, a mum and her children trying to secure shelter couldn’t even go to her parents or siblings,they were shielding at this time.”She said clients who were facing marital problems and violence in the home came from all walks of le. “It doesn’t matter how much wealth you have, or your family circumstances. If a person’s violent, it affects all aspects of your le.“You can secure a non-molestation order for mental, emotional and physical ill behaviour, and crucially, this extends to the children. It could extend to an occupation order for one of the parties and can extend to exclusion zones.“That alone has been really challenging, in terms of where does the other person go  The first priority will always be the welfare of the children and we always implore that is where the parties focus on first.“Previous to the pandemic, people would go to shelters, Women’s Aid, secure housing, perhaps getting an application to protect the inidual.“Normally the other party who is leaving the house might stay with relatives, but this wasn’t always possible during lockdown as older relatives were shielding. That was the big challenge.”During lockdown, children of orced or separated parents were allowed to visit the non-residential parent.But that sometimes threw up problems. “We had a couple of cases where the we might have health concerns and in lockdown, and was taking shielding very seriously.“Then you might have had a husband posting pictures on Facebook of having lots of family in the house, leaving the mum feeling very exposed. Trust breaks down and that’s when the problems start to happen.“If the relationship has deteriorated to a stage where it’s gone, then it’s gone, and unfortunately in this environment, one party might just take any given opportunity to try and annoy or harm the other. Lockdown facilitated a toxic opportunity for some parents to harass the other.“Realistically, a parent might have to restrain contact with another, which is not ideal for the children,they are trying to stay home with a very serious underlying health concern and the other parent completely undermines their situation.”But she said there could often be space for people to calm down and take the most reasonable approach. “They may even agree to wait until the two years separation is up with consent, and make a pact to stop vocally criticising one another.“They may even come to the conclusion that a contested orce can cost lots of money. They might question the orce in terms of, ‘We should consider our children first, then organise our finances in the short term, because after all, who’s going to pay these bills, maintenance costs, etc ’“Out of all the contacts we would have had over the last  months, that’s generally the approach. Even with people who have come thundering through the door demanding ‘I want a orce!’, once you sit them down and provide them with all their options, they do have a natural tendency to try to exit this chapter as cost-effectively as they can. We advise them on all the steps and issues and they take it from there.”The number of petitions filed on the ground of adultery was slightly lower in the first quarter of , down from nine to six.Wives filed eight petitions for adultery in early , with just one husband going down the same route.One year on, six wives filed on the same ground, and no husbands.Ms Rice said the lack of opportunities for adultery in lockdown could have an impact on petitions made on that basis. She added: “Unreasonable behaviour extends to a much wider area, such as inappropriate relationships online, or it can be tantamount to gambling, drinking, drugs, financial abuse.“Going back to my previous point about restrictions, because people were effectively house-bound, there was an increase in domestic violence and online relationships.”Divorce was a process where trust had to be built between client and lawyer, she said. “You have to think that you are helping someone, caring for them. It’s a journey and it’s about building your relationship with the client.“You have to carefully build trust, helping them focus on the remedies that are right for them and not just take it straight to court. We offer mediation and suggest mediation at first. We’ll try a collaborative approach, I’m a collaborative-trained lawyer.“We’ll try every possible avenue we can first, rather than going into this adversarial and frightening forum of court. With lockdown we were not physically going into court, which for some people, proved an anti-climax.”She said she was not convinced that the petition figures were already reflecting the increased activity in firms. Instead, petitions may have been prepared at the end of , when firms were allowed to provide all services, but were not filed until the start of .Divorce has been become more common in Northern Ireland with numbers of orces registered jumping from  in  to , in .For the last  years, the numbers of orces registered every year has passed the , mark, peaking at , in .She said orce clients ied in what they wanted from their representative. “Clients like to know their options, they will research and scope around. They need to know they can work with you. It’s like an interview. You build a rapport and learn that some might want a basic job, others look for a Rottweiler to employ. Everyone’s needs are dferent and catered for.”Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland Premium‘Children have been caught between warring parents’The Covid- pandemic and resulting lockdowns has transformed how we go about our everyday lives, and getting advice on marriage breakdown has been no dferent. Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Glenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Top VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest Northern IrelandEU ‘must stop punishing Northern Ireland over Brexit’Minister pressing Casement Park’s potential as World Cup venueRoyal Irish reserves to deploy to the Falkland Islands next monthMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageBBC NI closes three Radio Ulster programme Twitter accountsLatestClimate campaigner accuses court of ignoring evidence on Heathrow expansionSome quarantine-free travel for Scotland from May plans approvedAshley Giles will not allow England commitments to play second fiddle to IPLPub and hospitality bosses cautiously welcome indoor reopening from May Latest weekly Covid- rates for local authority areas in England,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo credit should read: Liam McBurney PA WireGareth CrossTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSteve Aiken#s resignation as UUP leader was his own decision and the party did not move against him, they have insisted.Mr Aiken said he came to the decision after consulting with party colleagues and decided he was no longer the best man for the job.However, the former Royal Navy Submarine Commander has confirmed his decision to remain in politics and continue as an MLA.He appeared at a press conference at Stormont on Monday morning to discuss his decision to resign over the weekend.Also present was UUP Chairman Danny Kennedy and potential leadership candidates MLAs Doug Beattie and Robbie Butler.Both men refused to be drawn onthey were standing for the position, saying they were present only to show solidary with Mr Aiken.Former MLA Mr Kennedy said Mr Aiken#s decision to resign stood in stark contrast of the removal of Arlene Foster as DUP leader.Steve does not stand alone today, he stands with me representing the entire party and with colleagues of the Assembly party, he said.Mr Kennedy praised the leadership he has given and the way he has conducted himself.It#s not for us, the nastiness and the unpleasantness of leadership change carried out in dark corners like the DUP removing Arlene Foster, who frankly deserved better, he said.Nor indeed would we replicate what Sinn Fein did in their purge in Foyle.Mr Aiken said he reached his dficult decision to resign because more than ever unionism and those in Northern Ireland need a clear political voice.Looking ahead I believe there is a place for a strong, progressive, inclusive unionist party, one can that deliver hope over fear and good government rather than endless posturing and bickering, the South Antrim MLA said.Mr Aiken said the UUP always put country over party and pointed to their decision to take the post of Health Minister in the Executive, despite the challenges it posed.He said he was extremely proud of the work of his predecessor Robin Swann during the coronavirus pandemic.I am however, self aware enough to admit, that despite our strengths, our party is not breaking through, Mr Aiken told the assembled press.I am also very aware of my own failings and despite successes over the past  months I realise that a change in leadership is needed.The UUP is a team in which all parts need to work effectively. Quite frankly it hasn#t been working as well as it should be, that is down to me. Rather than being seen to be part of the problem, I want to be part of the solution.Having ben in many command positions before I know and recognise the critical point when a change is needed. For the greater good and for a reinvigoration of the fight.Mr Aiken said resigning was bittersweet, but that a new leader was needed to get unionism ready.Pointing to the Scottish Parliament elections, which resulted in an overwhelming endorsement of the pro-independence SNP, he said we do have a real challenge ahead of us, but we#re ready for it.Referring to the DUP and his own party Mr Aiken said it was time for unionism to get it#s act together.Mr Butler said Mr Aiken would remain an important part of the party.On behalf of the Assembly group I wanted to pay tribute to his leadership and say that we look forward, not only to working with him, but to sitting beside him in the chamber, the Lagan Valley MLA said.Mr Beattie, widely tipped to be the next leader, said he was proud to call his fellow military veteran a friend.I#m standing here to support my party leader, my colleague and my friend Steve Aiken. It was dficult for him going through this process and he#s shown incredible moral courage to stand here today, the Upper Bann MLA said.I will think about whether or not it would be right for me to stand, I will take soundingsthe party want me to be leader andthey want to be led by me and then I will make a decision. I will try and do that as soon as I possibly can.Mr Kennedy said party officers had taken steps ahead of a leadership election and a special meeting of the party executive would take place on Tuesday night, followed by further announcements.Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Glenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Top VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest PoliticsWhat Donaldson could hear in proposed listening tourhe becomes DUP leaderAllison MorrisOpinionUnionism must look to the future when electing new leadersViewpointOpinionUUP needs to offer a real alternativeUUP’s Beattie and Butler in frame to lead partyFth of all EU border checks happening in Northern IrelandLatestPM defends plan to require ID to vote in the face of widespread backlashOne-metre plus social distancing rule may be scrapped next month, PM suggestsDo not throw caution to the winds, PM urges as hugs to be allowed againMP and newly-elected council leader to ‘earn every penny’ despite criticismRachel Riley tells court of job fears after Corbyn aide’s ‘dangerous’ tweet,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sam Blewett and David Hughes, PA Political StaffMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBoris Johnson has raised the prospect that the one-metre social distancing rule that has been key to limiting the spread of coronavirus could be scrapped next month.The Prime Minister also indicated on Monday that he may not go ahead with the introduction of coronavirus health certicates, which could require proof of vaccination or negative tests before entrance to certain venues.As he approved the next major easing of restrictions in England, Mr Johnson said the nation remains “on track” for the final step towards lting all legal restrictions as planned on June .When it comes to social distancing from June , I look at the data very carefully and I think at the moment, it looks to me as though we may be able to dispense with the one-metre plus rulePrime Minister Boris JohnsonBut the Prime Minister went further, to suggest it may be possible to scrap the one-metre plus social distancing rule from that point as well.“When it comes to social distancing from June , I look at the data very carefully and I think at the moment, it looks to me as though we may be able to dispense with the one-metre plus rule,” he told a Downing Street press conference.“That’s not yet decided, it’s not yet clear, we will have to wait and see.”While mask-wearing may continue in some form, it was not immediately clear what other advice to limit Covid-’s spread could remain in place after June .Mr Johnson indicated he would resist pressure to ease restrictions more quickly than planned, despite the success of the vaccine roll-out and the current measures.He said next Monday’s easing is a “very considerable unlocking” and stressed the need for caution and the need for “time to see the effect of each successive stage on the road map”.But the Prime Minister also said he is “confident we will be able to go further” on the road map, raising the prospect that Covid health certicates may not be required.#COVID

world will look like and what role there could be,any, for certication and social distancing,” he said.Mr Johnson added: “I’m optimistic that things will get back much closer to normality, let me put it like that, but clearly people are going to continue to want to exercise their own judgment, their own discretion, for a long while to come.”Standing beside the Prime Minister, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance suggested that transmission will be reduced by other means after June .He cited better ventilation and a greater proportion of people working from home where possible, as ways in which there will be a “residual reduction in transmission”.“There will still be behaviours that we will all demonstrate which means that contacts probably won’t be back to pre-pandemic levels,” Sir Patrick said.But Mr Johnson indicated that cities and towns will thrive again with social interaction.“The more people can communicate remotely with brilliant electronic devices, the more able they are to meet other people over the internet or through the ether, the more reasons they actually find to meet face to face,” he said.“I’m pretty certain – and I know this is contested – but I’m pretty certain that eventually our town centres and our city centres are going to be full of bustle, full of people wanting to interact again in the way that they always have done.”PAMost

Faced with having to take time off work to attend a local council office and request a special letter to let them vote, people will simply stay at home.— Electoral Reform SocietyMay , “Voting is safe and secure in the UK, meaning this policy is just an unnecessary barrier to democratic participation. Ministers need to listen to these concerns and drop these costly plans.“Millions of people lack photo ID in this country. These proposals will make it harder to vote for huge numbers of voters, locking ordinary people out of our democracy and unfairly discriminating against those who lack ID.”Sam Grant, head of policy and campaigns at Liberty, said: “Millions of people in the UK don’t have photo ID, and the vast majority of them come from communities that are already marginalised and under-represented by our political system.“Meanwhile the Government’s own findings show our current voting system is safe and secure. Instead of creating more barriers to voting, Ministers should focus on making it easier for everyone to vote, and ensuring we can all have an equal say in our democratic process.“As there is no justication for this threat to the right to vote, it feels like an opportunistic attack on the rights of some of the most marginalised people in society, a classic example of ruling through ision and distrust.”Under the Government’s plans, rules will be tightened on absent voting and voter intimidation as the Government aims to “stamp out” fraud.Measures will include a ban on postal vote harvesting by limiting the number of votes a person can hand in at a polling station on behalf of others.Voter intimidation is also expected to be listed as a form of undue influence in law, in order to prevent people from being coerced into giving up control over their vote.PAMost ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Glenmore Manor: Luxury Lurgan family home on sale for £kRory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtTUV face online backlash after UUP gay pride tweetRory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Top VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Burning car left on Northern Ireland railway trackPlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest UKOne-metre plus social distancing rule may be scrapped next month, PM suggestsDo not throw caution to the winds, PM urges as hugs to be allowed againMP and newly-elected council leader to ‘earn every penny’ despite criticismRachel Riley tells court of job fears after Corbyn aide’s ‘dangerous’ tweetClimate campaigner accuses court of ignoring evidence on Heathrow expansionLatestOne-metre plus social distancing rule may be scrapped next month, PM suggestsDo not throw caution to the winds, PM urges as hugs to be allowed againMP and newly-elected council leader to ‘earn every penny’ despite criticismRachel Riley tells court of job fears after Corbyn aide’s ‘dangerous’ tweetClimate campaigner accuses court of ignoring evidence on Heathrow expansion,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The guidelines, spread over two documents, offer bespoke advice depending on the category of care setting involved. “I fully recognise the importance of visiting for those who are receiving care. I hope this guidance will be widely welcomed, said Mr Swann. “It is also important to remember that the threat from COVID- remains very real. Everyone has a vital role to play when it comes to safe visiting. That includes social distancing, hand hygiene and not visitingyou are feeling unwell yourself.      Visiting was only ever restricted because it was absolutely necessary to do so to protect patients and residents from the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV- virus and subsequent development of COVID- infection. Given the progress that has been made against the virus, the time is now right to take steps to carefully re-introduce visiting. I welcome the work completed to draw up these updated guidance documents and hope that by implementing them we will take another step along the road to recovery.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In March , Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee refusedClanmil Housing Association permission to build a four-storey complex comprised of  apartments at Victoria Road. However, Clanmil appealed the decision and it has now been overturned. Local planning officers had described the location as ‘possibly the most dficult regeneration site’ in the city. However, the officers had recommended that councillors approve the application for the Victoria Road apartments as the application was ‘entirely compliant’. In their report, planning officers stated that they believed it would reinvigorate the riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. googletag.cmd.push  Among the objections raised by councillors had been that there was no parking provided within the plans for the Victoria Road apartments. At the meeting in March , local councillors said they believed a parking ban ‘discriminated’ against people with disabilities. At last year’s meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group said the apartment complex design looked like a ‘horric brutalist East German style eyesore’. Mr Hegarty said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in ‘hazardous parking’ on Victoria Road and he envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. googletag.cmd.push In response, a representative for Clanmil said it is a ‘highly accessible’ location with bus stops and train travel nearby. The housing association claimed that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. A report by the Planning Appeals Commission into the matter has now found that the objections were not sustained and overturned the decision to refuse planning permission. The decision to overturn the councils refusal decision has been criticised by local rail campaigners, Into the West. The land at Victoria Road was previously part of the Derry to Strabane railway line which closed in .     Into the West has been campaigning for the line to be reopened and they have described the decision to allow the apartment complex to be built on the site as a disaster. A building there will make it impossible to restore a railway line along that route in future – making it extremely unlikely we will ever see rail from Derry to Strabane or Letterkenny again, said Steve Bradley, chair of Into the West. Without a route to Strabane, there can be no direct rail services form Derry or Donegal to Dublin. And as Derry has a bigger population than every other town on the former Derry-Portadown rail route,our city can no longer be included in that proposed reopening then the viability of restoring rail to places like Omagh, Strabane, Enniskillen, Dungannon and Letterkenny also collapses. In short – building  apartments in that location will destroy any future for rail across the west of Ulster and prevent it being ed to Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,.

Mairead Healy, who is originally from Meenan Park in the Bogside area, was successful in last Thursdays council election in Romsey, a town with a population of around , people which is located seven miles from Southampton in the south of England. Speaking after her success, she said her thoughts were with her late mother Frances, brother and grandmother. She said: “I am over the moon that the people of Romsey have placed their trust in me to represent them for the Labour Party. googletag.cmd.push “As most people who know me will know, I’m not there simply to make up the numbers and I’m looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting stuck in - and maybe shaking things up a bit too.” She added: “For now, feeling so incredibly blessed and grateful to so many people who believed in me and who got out on the streets in the hail, wind and rain to canvas for me and the rest of the Romsey candidates. Thank you. “I’m also thinking about my mum, my wee brother Eamonn and my granny. It’s days like these when you really feel their absence, as they have missed out on so many of me and my sister Orla Oacute hEacuteiliacute’s big le events. googletag.cmd.push “But I’ve no doubt they have been watching over us from heaven and helping us along the way from up above.” Mairead left Derry  years ago to study law in the UK and has held several important positions, starting off her career working for the European Commission in Brussels. She then worked in human rights in London before making a career change and moving to Dublin to lead a national youth charity for several years. After that, she moved to the south of England where she was chief executive of a youth mental health service and was appointed to the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, a role she has recently stepped down from.     Currently, she works for a major international human rights organisation where she is part of the leadership team. She is also a postgrad student at Cambridge, training to be a child therapist and is head of safeguarding with Amnesty International UK, a post she has held since September . She said being brought up in Derry during The Troubles and the events of Bloody Sunday inspired her to get involved in struggles for justice and become an advocate for those without a voice. She said: “Growing up in the ’s as a working class Catholic from the Bogside during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, I was very much aware of the civil rights struggle affecting my community, particularly as the events of Bloody Sunday took place just a few streets from my home, where civil rights demonstrators were murdered by the British army. “As a result, it instilled in me from a young age a strong desire to be involved in struggles for justice and advocating for those without a voice. “In addition, as an adult, I also experienced some le changing events through the loss of some of my close family members in traumatic circumstances, which also affected my decision to campaign on particular areas of inequality.” She added she was really privileged to be able to work with and volunteer with ious communities over the years including Traveller groups, survivors of institutional abuse, refugees, iniduals who, she said, were homeless, young people and iniduals whose human rights are denied to them. She added: “As a result, I strongly believe in the value of grassroots capacity building to ensure that those without a voice can be supported to advocate for themselves and ensure their voices are heard and represented in decision making.” She explained her reasons for standing for election. “It goes without saying that the implications of the pandemic will be felt for many years to come and there will be signicant economic consequences of this, combined with Brexit. “I want to play my part in ensuring our communities are supported in the years ahead, which is why I am putting myself forward as a candidate.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

I had a long chat a couple of weeks ago with an old UUP friend who was complaining about a recent interview in which I had said the UUP was still dogging the DUP’s footsteps.By Alex KaneMonday, th May , : pm  \"       \"  I called him yesterday: “So, the DUP has a leadership contest and now the UUP is having one.” There was a pause: “Fair enough, Alex, can we talk about Sherlock Holmes instead ”The news about Steve Aiken came as no surprise. The sheer volume of internal complaints about him suggested his time was up. I’ll join together two comments I heard yesterday afternoon: ‘His removal was properly conducted, unlike the surgical removal of Arlene Foster or the Sinn Fein purge in Foyle.after hard conversations there wasn’t exactly a chorus suggesting he hang on any longer.’ The problem with Aiken – although in almost any other walk of le it wouldn’t count as a problem – is that he was much too nice to lead a political party. Particularly one as dficult to lead as the UUP has been since Terence O’Neill’s era. He is a decent man with a brisk, efficient, managerial approach to problems. But that’s not what the UUP needed this last  months. And it’s certainly not what party members – who do the hard slog of elections and door-knocking – wanted.   \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...UUP members viewed Steve Aiken’s media interviews sometimes with quiet despair and occasionally utter disbeliefThey wanted someone who would land a few powerful blows on the DUP: and particularly on Arlene Foster. There’s still a section of the party which has never forgiven either her or Donaldson for defecting to the DUP and that section has been enjoying a feeling of schadenfreude as it read about her travails this past year. Or, as a -year-old, Trimble-supporting member of the party texted me when he heard that the DUP had thrown her overboard: ‘Slap it up her. She should have known they would turn on her at some point.’Members and supporters voters of a party want to hear the leader do well in interviews. They want to feel buoyed-up and able to punch the air: particularlythey feel the leader they support has acquitted himself well. Aiken’s innate politeness prevented him from having many of those moments. Too often his supporters were just shrugging their shoulders and sighing: mostly in quiet despair, but occasionally in utter disbelief. Reg Empey stood down as leader after the UCUNF projectfailed to deliver any seats at the  general election. Tom Elliott lasted  months. Mike Nesbitt survived for five yearsbut stood down after a terrible Assembly result in . Robin Swann stayed for  months. Aiken, who officially resigns this morning at am, managed  months.Empey and Nesbitt both took risks to try and give the UUP something which could be described as signicantly dferent from the DUP . Both paid the price: but maybe it was more timing than anything . The DUP mocked the UCUNF pact, yet cut their own one with the Conservatives a few years later . In an interview for Brian Rowan’s new book, ‘Political Purgatory’Nesbitt noted: “I judged there was insufficient electoral support for my call for a post sectarian election and rather than try to hang on to the leadership and risk undoing five years of effort to unite my party, I resigned before the counts were even complete, so members could focus on the future. Since then, many people have told me I was too early, ahead of my time. Watching the so-called Alliance surge of , I wonderall I got wrong was the timing.’Nesbitt makes a fair point. That said, I still think he’s missing a key truth about the UUP: it is not – and hasn’t been so for a long, long time – a single, united party. It is still like a collection of smaller parties and competing interests and prone to taking sides when the leadertakes a stand on an issue. Ironically, the DUPis experiencing exactly the same dficulties: and may continue to do so , which seems inevitable, the new leader enjoys the support of just over half of the electoral college.All of which raises the only question that matters: what does a new leader do to give the UUP the something ‘signicantly dferent’ it needs to attract both media interest and new votes  Maybe a second question: , for example, the new leader wanted to widen the chasm between his party and the DUP, would a substantial, convincing majority of party members let him  Many recent leaders have fallen at the hurdle represented by that second question. Crucially, is there someone in the UUP who,he won the leadership, would not be afraid to make his own case and face down both internal and external opponents. Someone who would say: “This is what I want to do. If you elect me as leader then it is what I will do – so don’t pretend to be surprised afterwards when I start doing it.”If that person doesn’t exist, then it won’t be long until the party doesn’t, either.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
