Sadly, it wasn’t to be.‘For me, the only choice after losing him was to keep our home, horses and everything just as it was. My aim was to fulfil the dream we had begun together and live as I had always lived — one day at a time and in the moment.‘I didn’t give a thought to the fact that eventually it might become too much for me.’Susan would tell friends it was her horses that saw her through the darkest times.‘Whenever I felt down, I would wrap my arms around one of their strong necks and feel their power, sensitivity and strength.’She refers to the horses as her ‘children’ and is fastidious about who they are sold on to.         During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside‘I need to know they are going to be loved and cared for in the way I love and care for them,’ she says. ‘That’s all that matters. Sometimes it’s heartbreaking parting with them, especially my favourites. But I want what’s best for them.’Even while she was making films in Hollywood, she always dreamt of one day working with horses.During their time in LA, Susan and Simon would talk about maybe one day owning a farm in the countryside with pigs, sheep and rare breeds.‘After we married in Fiji, we made the decision to leave California. We bought a beautiful 17th-century farmhouse in Northampton.’It was here that they started breeding Arabians.‘I loved my first mare to pieces and although she was primarily my riding horse, she was mother of my first foal. And there it began.’Almost before they knew it, they had ten horses to manage but not enough land.It was while visiting friends in a remote part of Devon that they came across what they considered ‘the most beautiful spot on Earth’ — Exmoor National Park. There, they were able to buy a sheep and cattle farm of 50 acres, which would allow them to expand their Arabian stud business.‘It’s not for nothing that Lorna Doone was written here,’ Susan says. ‘The wilds of Exmoor are rough and rugged — it’s special. This house had been dearly loved by a farmer and his wife and there was a good feeling about it from the moment we stepped inside.‘I love this house so much. It’s my beautiful home. But beautiful as it is, it’s deep in the heart of the countryside, which makes it difficult for me to do anything spontaneously.‘I used to think of my farm as my sanctuary, as “the place where Simon is”.

It will be with several of my horses, though, and I’ll continue to breed them, just in a much smaller way.‘Simon would have wanted me to move sooner, I’m certain of that. But he would also know I would do it in my own time.’Apart from returning to the world of acting, Susan is in the throes of completing her autobiography. She promised Simon she would complete her memoirs.He always encouraged her to write, saying that her stories were far too good not to be shared with other people.During her career she has mixed with royalty — she is a friend of Prince Charles and attended his marriage to Princess Diana — and Hollywood stars.‘I’m so fortunate to have been part of that era when you would go to a party and think nothing of being in the company of Cary Grant and Grace Kelly,’ she says.Her friends at the time included Frank Sinatra, Lord Olivier, Liza Minnelli, Michael Caine and Olivia Newton-John.In 2016, in memory of Simon, she launched Lasting Life, the Simon MacCorkindale Legacy, a charity that aims to provide financial support for cancer sufferers.‘His wish would have been to help others in his name,’ she says.Some years ago, Susan brought Simon’s 93-year-old mother Gill to live with her at the farm, and says she would never contemplate her mother-in-law going into a nursing home.‘I treasure her,’ she says. ‘I’m so happy to have her in my life.’As she prepares herself for the next chapter, I wonder whether she feels ready for romance again.She tosses back her blonde hair. ‘There will only ever be one love of my life and that was Simon,’ she says.‘I’m never lonely, life is incredibly busy and I’m happy in my own company. Do I think Simon would want that for me? The answer probably is yes, and mine would be, you can never say never!‘None of us knows what’s around the corner. I am mindful that everything we have in life is on loan to us and I appreciate it all. I was so lucky to have 30 years of unconditional love shared with Simon and for that I will always be grateful.’Susan’s focus at the moment is on discussions for a documentary about her life with horses and the charity.The farm is buzzing with excitement in preparation for their next big fundraiser, the Georgian Arabians showcase, and friends from the entertainment world will be joining her to celebrate.‘To be surrounded by special friends and horses,’ she says. ‘What more could I ask for?’"},{"url":null,"title":"College girls told irate frat man disrespectful taking CHOCOLATE MILK","story":"Share this article The Wisconsin native realizes that the man is not of fan of theirs and apologizes for the grievance, adding that they \u0027didn\u0027t know.\u0027          The frat dude walks off with his milk in hand while Mayer and her friend look at the camera in disbelief at the entire ordeal.Mayer even tries to pour the contents of her cup back into the jug. \u0027You didn\u0027t know, think about respect and understanding how s**t happens,\u0027 the fraternity brother asserts. \u0027Like you just don\u0027t go into someone\u0027s crib.

Then its lustre faded. Now, after a £42m revamp, the arts powerhouse is back – with a double whammy of stunning showsLike a stately modernist weathervane, Fairfield Halls has always been an indicator of Croydon’s ambitions. When the concert hall and theatre complex opened in 1962, it was a beacon of the London suburb’s progressive vision, billed as the Royal Festival Hall Mark II, but with even better acoustics. In this brave new world of skyscrapers and motorways, it provided state-of-the-art cultural facilities, hosting the Beatles, Stevie Wonder and Kraftwerk – along with wrestling matches and televised snooker. But by the 1990s, as the town’s modernist lustre faded to stained concrete, the billing was mostly occupied by slot-filling tribute bands of tribute bands and pantomimes featuring Basil Brush.“Spectacularly awful,” is how Colm Lacey describes the state of Fairfield Halls by the time it closed for refurbishment in 2016. “Really dark, grim and abused by years of underinvestment.” As head of Brick by Brick, the council’s development company, Lacey has overseen the £42m redevelopment of the complex, which has finally reopened this week, billed as the “Southbank Centre of Croydon”.The opening programme features Broadway hit The Producers and the UK premiere of the Angela’s Ashes musical, while resident orchestra, London Mozart Players, will be joined by the UK’s premiere black theatre company, Talawa, as well as the inclusive community company, Savvy. Fans of the former Fairfield need not despair: the schedule still features the Sixties Gold 55th Anniversary Tour and An Evening with Lenny Henry.Regular visitors to this handsome mid-century ocean liner of culture will be pleased to discover that, in the main, the refurbishment has been mercifully light-touch. Much of the foyer clutter that had accrued over the years has been stripped away to reveal a light-flooded place that feels truer to the intentions of the original architects, Robert Atkinson \u0026amp Partners. Cylindrical columns, previously entombed in layers of woodchip and paint, have been restored to a smart polished black finish, while a tacky undulating ceiling has been torn down to expose a crisp sawtooth soffit. Majestic new chandeliers dangle above the “sun lounge” mezzanine, remade to match the 1960s designs, while the original typefaces have also been unearthed and used to create bold signage around the building, adding to the mid-century feel without veering into nostalgic kitsch.The two main auditoria have been brought up to date, with new heating and ventilation, additional stage infrastructure and retractable acoustic blinds in the concert hall for amplified music, while the Ashcroft theatre has been expanded by 50 seats, hitting the 800-seat sweet spot to attract more touring productions. The original red velvet flip-down seats have been kept in both venues, selectively refurbished and replaced (although some still look a little tatty), complete with their perforated wooden undersides to help the acoustics.Meanwhile, an underused gallery space has been converted into two studios, further expanding the kind of productions the venue can host. As Magnus Wills of Mica Architects puts it: “Now you’ll be able to have Stormzy, Rachmaninoff and Angela’s Ashes all happening at once.” There’ll be free lunchtime concerts in the foyer to boot.Much of the four-year project has been a process of invisible mending, and some locals will no doubt wonder where the many millions have been spent. Asbestos removal swallowed a huge chunk, as did the surgical insertion of new mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, while the usual unpredictable complexities of refurbishing a 50-year-old structure saw the budget increase by £11m along the way.“Brick by Brick was set up in response to the fact that Croydon had been taken for a ride by the private sector for too long,” says Lacey. He describes how the borough had been subjected to a plague of land trading, whereby developers would apply for planning permission simply to raise the value of their sites, then sell them on. The process would happen again and again, leaving blighted vacant sites and ever-reducing the potential amount of affordable housing that could be delivered. Lacey says Brick by Brick is “a deliberate attempt to pull apart the development system and repackage the inidual elements so the council benefits”. By the council effectively acting as the developer, he says, “nowhere along the way does money leak out to the private sector”.It’s a ballsy model that reflects just how far councils are having to bend their usual practices in order to do things they used to be able to do with direct government funding. To critics, it smacks of the public sector behaving too much like a developer, particularly when 30-storey towers are the byproduct. To Lacey, it is a pragmatic response to desperate times, and a means of ensuring that development value is captured for the public good.Either way, Fairfield Halls has been saved and revamped, at no additional expense to council coffers, in a climate when it would otherwise most likely have been demolished to make way for more bloated towers – of the kind that are increasingly surrounding it. By any calculation, it’s a win for Croydon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e306790a4a3dd87838b7a92a8da68376a82646/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88278e48c30bd5058878a3b85d173447","title":"have you been affected by the closure of pawnbroker albemarle bond","story":"We’d like to hear from staff and customers who have been affected by Albemarle \u0026amp Bond shutting its shops.

But if a “Brexit election” is upon us – one entirely and narrowly framed by Britain’s relationship with the European Union – then our current turmoil is merely the appetiser for much worse to come. That is the plan of Boris Johnson’s unelected co-prime minister, Dominic Cummings: sweep up the Brexit party vote, drown out a Labour domestic agenda that proved popular in 2017, and fragment the anti-Tory vote with the willing assistance of the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson.There are those who treat the Brexit crisis as though it has landed from a clear blue sky: many were jelly-kneed at the admirable 2012 Olympics opening ceremony, claiming that it represented, as former New Labour spin-doctor Alastair Campbell put it, a Britain that was “modern, vibrant, dynamic, outward-looking, multicultural, confident, welcoming, successful, united”. It was no such thing: the ToryLib Dem government was busy offloading the costs of a crash caused by big finance on to the backs of those who had nothing to do with it: slashing and privatising services, scapegoating migrants – two months before Windrush Britons were valorised in the thanksgiving ceremony, the “hostile environment” immigration policy had been introduced – and ravaging the welfare state. But the Brexit result produced one consensus: that it could not be understood without examining what Theresa May termed “the burning injustices”.May’s objective in 2017 was to wage a Brexit election themed around crushing “the saboteurs”, as the Daily Mail labelled her opponents. This was Labour’s nightmare, but its manifesto – described by some of its rightwing MPs as “childish” and a “10-year old’s letter to Santa Claus” – reframed the election as “for the many not the few”, consigning a Tory party convinced it would win a 100-seat majority to a hung parliament. Surely repeating the same trick now seems impossible: both because the Brexit cliff edge is far closer and the country is far more bitterly polarised over the EU question than it was just two years ago.The anti-Tory election pitch must be that a “Brexit election” cannot simply obsess over an economic and political relationship with the EU, important though that is, but address the resentments generated by these injustices. If an election that could determine the government for the next half a decade doesn’t resolve them, then what comes next?The Tories will talk of turning on the spending taps, which in practice means addressing what they see as the focus-grouped priorities of leave voters, – not reversing a decade of slash-and-burn cuts, let alone the social damage of Thatcherism. What, then, must an election answer? Britain is scarred by some of the worst regional inequalities in the western world: they helped drive the resentments that led to Brexit. Under current government plans, London is set to receive nearly three times more transport spending per person than the north of England. A report headed by ex-civil service head Bob Kerslake earlier this year called for a national renewal fund to tackle regional inequalities, modelled on Germany’s post-Berlin Wall reunification. That would mean hiking regional spending to at least £10bn a year over the next quarter of a century, alongside a programme of radical decentralisation. Such proposals must surely be at the heart of an election debate. A squeeze on workers’ wages unprecedented since the early 19th century is a key driver in our turmoil: this week, research by the New Economics Foundation finds that living standards remain below pre-crash levels. It cannot be orced from Britain’s productivity crisis – worse than any time for over a century, and more than 18 per cent below its pre-Lehman Brothers trend – which has robbed workers of up to £5,000 in income. Ending this lost decade must be a central election theme. Even the Financial Times, that well-known den of socialist agitation, is arguing for capitalism to be “reset”, decrying an economy based on rent extraction, financial speculation (“liberalised finance tends to metastasise, like a cancer”), inequality and stagnant productivity. All are factors in an “increasingly degraded democracy”, concludes its chief economics commentator, Martin Wolf. He’s right, and a radical root-and-branch restructuring of the economy must accordingly be at the centre of the election debates.What of a housing crisis that has left one in every 200 Britons homeless or inadequately housed, and millions trapped in an unregulated, insecure and rip-off private rented sector? What of how the world’s sixth biggest economy has left a fifth of its population in poverty? What of a social care crisis imperilling the security of older and disabled people, or the dismal failure of universal credit, which Gordon Brown warns could cause riots in Britain’s streets? What of a climate emergency – we have just 11 years to prevent disaster according to the UN – whose consequences will include drastic economic and social dislocation? Unless the election tackles these multiple, overlapping crises, we may look back at this era as one of relative tranquillity.It suits both Tories and Lib Dems to make this election purely about Brexit. While supporting austerity, For the sake of a few more seats, Swinson cynically portrays Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as the same on Brexit, as though there is no difference between a hard Brexit and a second referendum with remain on the ballot. Instead, we need a campaign that speaks to the crises endangering the very fabric of society – and which offers a weary nation some hope."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be001f5f5b7cee4fc70205446e8f4fa4faea03c8/0_131_2224_1334/master/2224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5138fa53137b8853ffd0524499414df6","title":"jeremy corbyn brexit referendum labour panel","story":"Neutral! In mid-national crisis how does a party campaign on the great issue of our time with a leader who won’t say where he stands? Everything about the idea is preposterous. What do canvassers say on the doorstep? We’re a bit split and our leader refuses to say.Jeremy Corbyn in today’s  accuses Boris Johnson of backing no deal simply because it’s politically expedient. But Corbyn’s fence-sitting is no different. No one expects straight-dealing from Johnson: double-dealing is priced in. But it’s dangerous for Corbyn to flaunt callow political calculation. Honesty is his USP. What else was he doing all those wilderness back-bench years voting against his own government 500 times, if not standing up for unpopular principle? He was always a leaver, remain voters will assume, while leavers will not be convinced either by his umpire’s disguise.He has spent his life advocating Bennite democracy, where the party makes policy, not the leaders. Most of the party, plus the great majority of its voters, are strong remainers: how does he square that?But wait, there is – just – a hair’s breadth of an escape hatch in his article. He would renegotiate a less-damaging Brexit, put it to a referendum and implement the result. That’s fine. Though he implies his role is only as referee, he doesn’t – quite – say he would campaign for neither side. It’s for this weekend’s Labour conference to make him take his members’ side – not some conference floor stitch-up by some unions and backroom fixers. If not, expect another mighty flight of Labour voters to the Liberal Democrats.With Labour conference fast approaching, the party has now firmed up its commitment to giving the people the “final say” on Brexit as the only way to break the impasse. Jeremy Corbyn has set out his unequivocal support for a referendum between remain and a “sensible” plan to leave.Labour can make such a commitment precisely because its proposals for the future partnership with the EU were welcomed by senior EU leaders earlier in the year as a way to break the deadlock. Unburdened by Brexit dogma, Labour’s plan also has the benefit of being common sense: continuing the UK’s economic, social and security cooperation but on a new and different political basis. It was always the logical response to a close vote.There will still be pressure for Labour to be more vocally committed to remain. But as the Liberal Democrats have shown in Bournemouth this week, becoming a “remain party” is neither simple nor costless. Leading Lib Dems have found themselves unable to consistently explain when they would support revoke and when they would want a second referendum. That’s because “revoke” is the demand of a pressure group, not a serious political party.But with activists lined up to demand a remain position against more circumspect trade unions, there is potential for a major row at the Labour conference next week. Only Corbyn can defuse it – by emphasising that Labour is a democratic and pluralist party that will respect those who support leaving the EU while reminding members that he himself campaigned to remain in 2016 and would do so again.If Britain is to move on from Brexit, it needs a vision for the economy and society beyond Brexit and political leadership capable of governing for the whole nation, whether we are in or out of the EU.Puffed-up gesture politics for revoke or for no deal will keep the country in crisis far into the 2020s. The Tories and Lib Dems have promised to hurtle Britain towards calamity – whether via the economic crash promised by the former, or the democratic disaster by the latter. Now is Labour’s chance to show it can pull Britain back from the brink.• Tom Kibasi is director of the Institute for Public Policy Research. He writes in a personal capacityYou do not have to like them to realise the best political slogans – think “Vote leave, take control”, “Labour isn’t working” or “Make America great again” – are the ones you can fit on a bus or baseball cap.So pity the Labour staffer tasked with turning Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit position into something pithy. The best I can manage is “Brexit, but not this Brexit, or maybe not Brexit at all – over to you”. It is a neat manifestation of the agonies he has suffered for three years on this issue.It is also rather unfair. Brexit is complicated. Only the zealots think there is no compromise to be made. There are plenty: between our economic interests and political fit, between what the people and their elected representatives think is best, between the simplicity of slogans and the ugly reality of our entanglement in the European economy. As a would-be majority party, Labour has to contain multitudes, and contradict itself.So I find something oddly honourable in Corbyn’s refusal to get off the fence. But what looks like an honest acknowledgment of ambiguity to some is a sneaky lack of principle to others. How can an issue so important to so many elicit such a painstakingly calculated shrug?In 10 years each of the major parties has tried to sell itself as the only one to offer the people a vote on Europe. But people are fatigued, and want something simple to end it all. Honourable or not, “over to you” is the last thing most of them want to hear.• Giles Wilkes is a former adviser to Vince Cable and Theresa May on economic policyI didn’t support the first referendum and do not support a second. But the sentiment behind Labour’s stance is important, recognising isions and seeking to allow them expression. Labour is ided because the country is ided. We represent places that voted to leave and remain in large numbers. In Walthamstow, another referendum and remain seems obvious to many in Wigan, for the most part, it seems absurd. To pick a side kills any hope of bringing a ided country back together. We can no more wish away the votes of 17.4 million people who voted leave than the 16.1 million who voted remain – and nor should we.Nevertheless, problems remain. To make a case to hold a second referendum before there has been any serious attempt to implement the first is impossible in many constituencies. People who voted, after years of disillusionment, strongly believe democracy is at stake. We cannot defend liberal democracy against a prime minister who trashes it without acknowledging the harm this does.Still, there is honesty in acknowledging that isions exist and that those who pretend there are easy answers are not being truthful. A referendum considered illegitimate by many will have severe consequences. Leaving with no deal will put jobs and lives at risk. Negotiating a good deal will take years. I believe the right compromise is to leave with a deal that protects our close ties with the EU, but there are no paths open to us that do not come at a cost. Labour is the only party prepared to acknowledge it, and the truth matters.• Lisa Nandy is the Labour MP for Wigan"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b29b6943e10e3a0d303b1799e8c862697088b0db/80_0_2215_1329/master/2215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0d4316a1860164ed8bfc028c726a893","title":"the best way to deal with online trolls do like rachel riley starve them of oxygen","story":"As Countdown’s human calculator has shown with her Twitter abusers, blocking them – and not engaging – is a better way of dealing with themIf you want to know what sort of world we live in, Rachel Riley has had to block 1,500 people on Twitter. That’s right: Countdown’s human calculator has attracted such a swell of antisemitic hatred that she has been forced to silence enough people to fill Sadler’s Wells.We know how many people Riley has blocked because she is taking part in a campaign urging people not to publicise the social media abuse they receive. Now, you might argue that going on TV and assigning a hard numerical value to the amount of abuse you get online isn’t necessarily the best way to avoid publicising the amount of abuse you get online. But, hey, Riley’s the numbers whiz, not me.And anyway, her point holds up. We live in testing times, and we have all been conditioned to be tired and punchy. But lashing out clearly isn’t working. In real life as well as online, it might be time to rediscover the lost art of ignoring dickheads.Russell Crowe understands the appeal of a block. A few years ago, during an interview with the , he even suggested that Twitter should make the act of blocking someone more enjoyable, arguing: “When you push ‘Block’, there should be like a nuclear explosion, and that person’s photograph is shattered to a million fucking pieces, so you go: ‘Yeah, see ya mate.’ BOOM.”Instead, I prefer the mute option, which prevents you from seeing most of someone’s tweets, but without them knowing it. I’ve muted hundreds and hundreds of people on Twitter. I’ve muted trolls. I’ve muted public figures. I’ve muted people who just happened to ambiently annoy me once. I’ve muted colleagues. I’ve muted friends whose online personas try too hard. And it’s great, because they don’t even know they have been muted, the poor idiots. They are all screaming away like their lives still depend on it, but nobody can hear them. If blocking is like a nuclear bomb, then muting is like slowly poisoning someone’s food. I cannot recommend it enough.But of course this is what we all should do. It’s what we do in real life. When a swaggering, lagered-up moron gets on your train and starts keening around for a fight, you quietly move carriages. If a shopkeeper is weirdly aggressive to you, you visit a different shop. If a family member is constantly critical of your every decision, you pack your things and move to a different country. We’ve all done that, right? Just me?Confrontation is wildly overrated in my book. We’re all getting older and our energy is limited why waste it on people who just want a reaction?

The longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s history gambled that a second election in six months would win him a mandate when he couldn’t form a coalition. But the results appear to have shifted in favour of rival Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party.Voters cannot have gone to the polls on Tuesday with any great excitement. Blue and White hewed even more closely to Likud than it did in April’s contest. Overall there was strikingly little change in voting patterns, as one pollster pointed out: a small portion of the right moved to the secular nationalist Avigdor Lieberman, making him look very much like the kingmaker. The outcome is remarkably close, with Mr Gantz just one seat ahead as final results continued to trickle in, and both men vowed to lead Israel’s next government. Mr Netanyahu is a consummate survivor and his will to fight is sharpened by the knowledge that his freedom may depend upon it: he faces pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases in a matter of weeks. No office, no immunity.The grim tactics that have worked so well for Mr Netanyahu before failed to do the trick. Once again he demonised and sought to intimidate Israel’s Palestinian citizens, but such efforts appeared to backfire: their voting rate increased considerably (though Ayman Odeh’s ability to forge a much more coherent bloc from the Arab parties also played a big part). The apparent failure of the racist, far-right Jewish Power party to cross the electoral threshold is also a relief. But Mr Netanyahu continues to attract substantial support despite a record of dangerous rhetoric and unscrupulous actions which would have ousted any leader with a sense of shame long ago. There was no great electoral repudiation of his race-baiting still less was this campaign a reckoning with his treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, who do not have a vote. The conflict was notable chiefly by its omission – reflecting the country’s rightwards lurch, with politicians seeking not a solution to the conflict, but ways to manage Palestinians.Mr Gantz enjoys goodwill in Israel as a former military chief who has no corruption allegations hanging over him. He is thought unlikely to embrace so enthusiastically the likes of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán and more likely to shore up democratic institutions hammered by Mr Netanyahu. He is regarded as more responsible and less isive than his opponent – not hard. But he has positioned himself as almost indistinguishable on security. When the prime minister vowed to annex the Jordan valley and northern Dead Sea – a move which the liberal pro-Israel lobby group J Street in the US warned “would destroy Israeli democracy and constitute a flagrant violation of international law” – Blue and White’s response was that he had stolen its idea. The fear is that Mr Netanyahu’s continued tenure, coupled with the Trump administration, could lead to his election threats becoming reality this time. Even if Mr Gantz would be more pragmatic, he falls far short of being the change that Israel needs.If Mr Netanyahu leaves power thanks to this election, it will probably be as much because his history of manoeuvring has come back to bite him as because voters lost faith. Like his friend Donald Trump, Mr Netanyahu was never fit for his office and has debased it. But he is a symptom as well as a cause of what is wrong with his country’s politics, and its biggest problems will not end when he departs, whenever that may be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22f956f6a93549465e5b7a4afc9e8b47c6576559/0_46_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e7c3352e47c560495980cb138fa6fe0","title":"galway ireland margaret atwood homer european capital of culture 2020","story":"Irish city welcomes Atwood and celebrates Homer as 2020 European capital of cultureHomer’s Odyssey is to be read aloud on the wind-battered beaches of Ireland’s west coast to celebrate claims that some of the mythical journey took place there, as part of Galway’s stint as European capital of culture in 2020.A blizzard of arts events was announced on Wednesday, including the light artist Kari Kola turning the mountains of Connemara green on St Patrick’s Day a visit by Margaret Atwood on international women’s day and a multi-art celebration of the writer JM Synge.There will also be Odyssey, which will feature a large tent being pitched on Galway’s beaches and chapters of Homer’s epic poem read out as the Atlantic laps towards the feet of the audience.Seán Doran, of the project producer Arts Over Borders, said the Homeric connection between the Mediterranean and Ireland was not totally outlandish. A year ago he was contacted by a Greek academic who claimed the landscapes of the stories in the Odyssey did stretch beyond the Mediterranean. Galway’s coast and the Aran islands fitted in with the tale about Odysseus and the Cyclops, he had insisted.“All this can be challenged, as can everything in Homer, so we are just using this as a springboard,” said Doran. “But it is totally fascinating and not wholly a surprise. We’ve all heard about Basque country and Egyptian music links with Irish music.”The Galway programme was announced by Helen Marriage, who was brought on board as the creative director in January to help steady what had been a troubled project, one wracked by resignations, rows over funding and questions over its vision. Its current budget is €39.7m.Marriage said the year of culture would have three themes of language, landscape and migration, with the aim of reflecting “what it means to be a modern European country in these difficult times”.She added: “Galway is the most extraordinary place and next year it’s at the heart of Europe. But you have a sense when you are there that it is right on the edge of Europe, looking out on the Atlantic, America next stop. It’s wild, it’s really exciting, I keep thinking it is like Barcelona with rain because it rains 240 days a year.”The company behind the most recent Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, Wonder Works, will coordinate Galway’s opening on 8 February. “It will be howling, it will be wet, the Atlantic will be horizontal but it will be brilliant fun,” said Marriage.The year will also see a new interpretation of Gilgamesh a tour by Druid Theatre of Ireland’s greatest one act plays and a collaboration with Boston, Nashville and Belfast which will celebrate the transatlantic roots of country, blues, gospel, folk and bluegrass.Galway will be one of two European capitals of culture next year, sharing the title with Rijeka, in Croatia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c309a708f8e685f1cc068078c744c00ecdb15d1a/0_177_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178b9f41a5cf649d7c8beb86c594d6b5","title":"tiny algae ground zero greenland melting glaciers","story":"Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a bellwether for climate crisis, but the impact on bioersity has been overlooked. At an ice station on a remote Arctic glacier, scientists are looking to the smallest of life forms to predict the pace of species extinctionby  Dan McDougall in Sermilik, 65˚40’ N and 38˚10’ W photographs by Carsten EgevangBehind the remote research huts of Sermilik ice station, a vast sheet of ice stretches north for 1,480 miles, ning an area three times the size of France.Across a narrow granite ravine separating the visitors’ hut from the main living quarters of the 40-year-old international scientists’ base, lab machines click and whirr through the night.The day’s samples – water, air, carbon, algae – spin frantically around curious-looking aluminium discs. Melting ice drips slowly into assorted beakers. Struggling to adjust to the midnight sun, a team of international research scientists from Aarhus University and Germany’s national research centre for solid earth sciences peer into microscopes at clues to the planet’s future. These are samples of glacial past and present, retrieved from the belly of the Mittivakkat glacier, which is in mortal retreat on the plateau above. To understand our origins, scientists look to the stars. To understand our eventual demise, the glacier is ground zero.Long hours are spent on the glacier and even more in the makeshift labs set up in a decrepit series of huts built in the late 1960s on the edge of this lonely archipelago some 40 miles away from the nearest settlement.Archive photographs in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, show that the Mittivakkat glacier’s vast icy mouth opened out to the Arctic Ocean as recently as the 1950s. But to reach its heart in 2019 is a hike many miles inland, crossing rocky terrain in entirely unexpected 23-degree heat. Lichen and unseasonal arctic flowers line the route, as do thirsty mosquitoes, who feast on the moisture of human eyeballs, relenting only at the ice line.Flying over a glacier by helicopter it’s easy to dismiss the landscape as devoid of life, but for the seven scientists at Sermilik hiking over the ice, it is a source of constant fascination for animal and plant life.Alexandre Anesio is a professor in Arctic biogeochemistry from Aarhus University. A charismatic Brazilian, he has a rifle slung over his shoulders – one of four armed researchers, all on constant vigil for the polar bears who stalk the coastline here. He is also probably the worst shot. His young doctoral students, Eva Doting and Laura Halbach, look more keen-eyed, having spent the last month preparing by shooting polar bear targets at a rifle range in Copenhagen.On the ’s first evening, over supper, Anesio explains with earnest patience that snow isn’t universally white. Some of the last snow to lie on the surface of the earth, long after the human race is gone, might even be red. Not blood-red – more a watermelon hue.He also talks about how, in the end, the fate of our glaciers, sea-level rises and bioersity loss, will not only come down to the excesses of the industrial age and our unbridled consumer life, but also to the influence of algae.The sticky green residue familiar from childhood tadpole ponds, as it turns out, could be a microscopic bellwether for this age of extinction.Each year, high on Greenland’s glaciers, algae perform a remarkable migration. After spending winter deep in the snowpack as dormant cysts, they awake in spring and swim through snowmelt, iding and photosynthesising along the route.When they reach the surface, the algae turn black, dark green and crimson – colours that come from astaxanthin, a molecular cousin of the chemical that makes sweet potato orange.The algae produce it as a sunscreen, as it absorbs UV light. As a consequence the humble algae dramatically reduce the amount of sunlight reflected by Greenland’s glaciers and increase the sunlight they absorb, darkening the snow and ice.Most concerning for the researchers out on the glacier is the fact the algae that live on the ice surface in summer are increasingly dark brown, leading them to absorb more sunlight and exacerbate melting.Along with his colleague Professor Liane Benning, Anesio leads a team responsible for this breakthrough discovery.As algae spread, the effect will be compounded, leading to even more melting. Benning, of the German Research Centre for Geosciences or GFZ in Potsdam, was previously part of the Black and Bloom project to understand how and why the Greenland ice sheet is melting. She says algae-discoloured snow isn’t just an Arctic phenomenon.“It’s a global occurrence,” she says. “This is increasingly a problem in the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan glaciers. Blooms of red snow and brown ice are turning up in Antarctica also. What we hope to do is spread our research out further because we believe this is a significant factor in ice melt. This is why we are back here in Greenland but we believe the work also needs to be done elsewhere.”The sound of a city block-sized portion of ice as it separates from Greenland’s ice shelf is unique. A violent sonic boom is followed by an echoing machine-gun style “ak-ak-ak-ak” as the iceberg turns on its axis, before surrendering to the ocean with an eerie silence. There is a sadness to it. On one single day last month, Nasa’s Oceans Melting Greenland project announced that Greenland’s ice sheet had suffered its most substantial single-day volume loss on record, sending an estimated 12.5bn tonnes of ice pouring into the Arctic Ocean – a body of water that could cover the whole of England in five inches of water. If the Greenland ice sheet disappeared tomorrow, sea levels around the world would rise by seven metres and life, as we know it, would come to an end.Sermilik’s scientists argue for serious thinking and funding to understand glacier loss. For Anesio, who left his job at Bristol University, transferring to Denmark because of the potential impact of Brexit on his research, science has to be “something collaborative”.“Our job as scientists is to create more accurate models and add to our global understanding of the climate crisis so that it can be used for politicians to take action – we hope, a little bit faster than is happening now.”As glaciers retreat from India to Greenland, bioersity is being lost. According to the UN one million species face extinction due to human influence. Such a collapse in bioersity would wreak havoc on the interconnected ecosystems of the planet, putting humans at risk by compromising food sources, fouling clean water and air, and eroding defences against extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods.As Greenland’s ice melt has been adopted by the world as a global bellwether for climate crisis, less focus is being placed on the impact on bioersity.This ice sheet is not just being melted by algae bloom and from above by warmer air temperatures. Arctic waters are reaching record high temperatures and warmer water is lapping against these great glaciers.For Greenland, one of the least densely populated countries in the world, the impact will be felt on land by the nation’s flowers, plants, bushes and heather, its polar bears, caribous, arctic hares, foxes and wolves and at sea by narwhals, seals, bowhead whales and the large variety of unique sea birds.This is bioersity that actually faces few direct pressures from human activities – the major threat is glacial melt and climate crisis. The shrinking of the sea ice area is already having a significant impact on marine ecosystems. It’s an essential habitat and breeding ground for many species, ranging from micro-algae to marine mammals.This is now a hungry time for polar bears struggling to access the sea ice to hunt for seals. An estimated 3,500 of the bears stalk the coastline of Greenland and at Sermilik, stories are swapped of close encounters with the animals.Scientific labours in the chill winds and high seas of the Arctic summer seem wrapped in an unusual sense of urgency this year. The scientists working in Greenland are keen to communicate their new, emerging understanding of the dynamics of the declining ice sheet to the broader world.According to Christopher Trivedi, a US member of the scientific team, communicating the work of the many scientists active across Greenland to local people is a vital and often overlooked part of the job. “I think science communication matters. We need to include the local community here with the work we are doing, and we also have a responsibility to explain the work we are doing here. What we are finding impacts the immediate environment more than anywhere else.”For the younger members of the Sermilik team, the bleakest conversation held at the ice station is around the plastic being discovered.“We are finding plastics in the atmosphere at the centre of Greenland’s ice sheet,” says Dr James Bradley, assistant professor at the Queen Mary University of London. “Millions of tonnes of plastic are discarded into the environment every year and are broken down into small particles and fibres that do not biodegrade. These particles, known as microplastics, have now been found everywhere from high mountains to deep oceans and can carry toxic chemicals and harmful microbes. Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic waste. Their presence in oceans and waterways has received a great deal of scientific and media attention in recent years, but our growing concern is their presence in the atmosphere.”It is evident that all the scientists feel a growing responsibility on their shoulders to answer questions that have been ignored for too long. This summer, in the face of record ice melt, there is a deeper purpose and an urgency to their work. They want more resources and new technologies to map the details of ice loss with greater precision. They want better global monitoring of nutrients and contaminants that are now trickling at ever higher rates from glaciers into downstream waterways. They want to expand their work to Antarctica and other parts of the glacial world.“To be honest, I’m massively worried,” says Anesio. “I just hope that we are not crossing that tipping point because I don’t think humans can adapt to the rates of changing climates at the moment.”He says that he also has hope, “because I can see a new movement in the young generation that cares. I think that everyone inidually can contribute, by pressing politicians, but also by making their contribution in terms of the reduction of CO2.”Leaving the ice station by boat, negotiating the same narrow channel of icebergs that brought us here, we pass over the shattered remnants of a glacier and stop to scoop a 1,000-year-old chunk of ice from the water. These lumps of ice can only meet one path, drifting out into the Arctic sea at the mercy of winds and warm currents until they break apart into the ocean.Days later, further north of the island, a local ship’s captain summed things up with his Greenlandic dark humour. “That noise you hear out there.

For several seasons now, across both her womenswear and menswear collections, there have been products that seem tailored to appeal to the hypebeast market.That flame shirt (hello Jeff Goldblum), the sandals, those big padded headbands. Now it is all about stripping it back. This collection featured outfits comprised of: knitted pencil skirts and ribbed knitted polo shirts woven cotton shift dresses fitted blazers and an excellent line in practically seasonless LBDs.The designer’s relaxed approach to serving the season without a big splash showed in the finish and finer detailing. Romantic dresses looked fresh from the washing line (no iron in sight), sequin-appliqued skirts had a DIY feel as though customised, and shell necklaces looked as if they might have been made on the beach this summer.While there were still the chunky high-heel loafers that Prada devotees worship, many of the outfits were grounded by woven raffia flats – the kind that you pull out for your holidays or for running around town. This element of the collection evoked a spontaneous feel which – Prada said, post show – was her intent.From the wide-lapelled leather jackets and to the retro-printed suiting, a strong 1970s feel reverberated, while upturned sou’wester-cum-cloche hats reasserted the idea of clothes that stand the test of time. “The past is still very important, especially for me,” Prada said.It is an apt statement given that the brand has clearly been reflecting on its position on the world stage of late. Like many of her fellow luxury fashion designers, Mrs Prada has recognised the need to address several pressing issues within her ranks to adapt accordingly and this year has seen her throw serious weight behind her words.In February, the brand announced it would launch its Diversity and Inclusivity Council “to elevate voices of colour within the company and the fashion industry at large”, following criticism for figurines which appeared to contain blackface imagery in a New York store.And in August, it joined 31 other fashion brands – including Burberry, Chanel and Zara owner Inditex – in signing up to the Fashion Pact, a mandate to work collaboratively with competitors to reduce negative impacts by the fashion industry on the environment and humanity.As the first big hitter out of the door at Milan fashion week, all eyes were on this show to take the temperature of where Italian designers stand on taking a more sustainable approach.While Italy’s fashion capital may not have the likes of Extinction Rebellion – the protest group which disrupted the London shows in an attempt to hold the industry to account – out in force, Prada kicked things off by showing that a new way of thinking is on her agenda."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36c54b02ba66ee76e6c9bdbd89ddd9fe5dd1d04d/0_100_5125_3074/master/5125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f039269da9642883e204faa572022a4f","title":"ad astra review brad pitt tommy lee jones james gray","story":"With echoes of Apocalypse Now and 2001, James Gray’s spectacular epic dispatches Pitt on an interplanetary mission to find his missing fatherBrad Pitt never looked more beautiful than in this mesmeric, flawed, superbly photographed and designed space adventure from director and co-writer James Gray. Pitt plays an astronaut in what is tantalisingly described as the “near future” and Gray’s camera traces the scorched and incised surfaces of distant planets with the same awe that it travels across Brad’s face, savouring the lattice of tiny wrinkles around the eyes, and the discreet harvest of his one-day stubble.Gray’s direction, like Pitt’s performance, is fiercely intended and intricately controlled and the resulting movie has some of the epic and Conradian qualities of his last film, The Lost City of Z – though with a more satisfying structure and story arc, and with more exciting set pieces. It is, perhaps, a little derivative and maybe finally fudges the dark mystery of the quest’s end point. But this is a film with thrilling ambition and reach.Pitt plays Major Roy McBride, an astronaut impeccably cool under pressure, and with a dedication to the job that has perhaps cost him his marriage to Eve (a mute and largely flashback-centred cameo for Liv Tyler). Roy is, moreover, the son of revered astronaut Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), who taught his boy the values of hard work and emotional self-control, and who became legendary on the news of his death decades ago while heading up a pioneer exploratory project near Neptune. Roy demonstrates his own sang-froid while repairing a rig the height of seven skyscrapers, which begins to shudder under the impact of a terrifying power surge, until McBride free-climbs out to shut off the voltage: a quite stunning opening sequence.His superiors consider that now is the moment to tell Roy that his father may still be alive, having somehow gone rogue or gone native in deep space, and is causing these terrifyingly dangerous surges. It is now Roy’s mission to voyage out there and confront his father. His own emotional blankness begins to disappear as the truth of his father’s existence begins to dawn, along with a suspicion that his superiors are not telling him the whole story.Ad Astra (from the Latin tag “per ardua ad astra” or “through struggle to the stars”) is a spectacular, immersive picture, offering an intelligent and deeply considered variation on existing themes. Obviously, there is something of Coppola’s Apocalypse Now, with Roy making a terrifying upriver journey to sacrifice or “terminate the command” of this patriarch-god – or is it his own command he’s going to terminate? The syntax and grammar of space travel on film owes something to Kubrick’s 2001, a film importantly conceived when space discovery was a matter of imminent fact, not fantasy, though Gray has his own distinctive vision. There’s a witty and shrewd depiction of the moon as extensively colonised and commercialised, like a banal shopping centre.Yet perhaps the most interesting comparison is with Terrence Malick, particularly The Tree of Life, where Pitt is playing the father and Sean Penn is the grownup son, and the journey – the journey we all make – is into the past, into the treacherous territory of our own memories. It is when Ad Astra becomes disorientating and hallucinatory that it is most Malickian.As to its accuracy, it’s reassuring that the film is not weighed down with preposterous and pseudo-scientific explanations. The idea of Clifford being able to cause “power surges” is not plausible on this realist level, but it works as a parable or a dream.Gray’s incidental details and characters are very good. Donald Sutherland has an enigmatic cameo as Colonel Pruitt, an old friend of Roy’s dad, who has been ambiguously called in for guidance or surveillance. Ruth Negga is excellent as the disquietingly intense Helen Lantos, who has personal reasons for hating Clifford, which in a complicated way are the reasons for wanting to help Roy. Quite aside from the gasp-inducing and vertiginous opening sequence, there is a gripping encounter with hostile moon buggies and a nightmarishly choreographed attack in a spacecraft that had been used for animal research. Here is where the movie is not just Freudian, but Darwinian.I wondered, just a little, if Pitt could have surrendered more to the emotions the film was invoking, or if the ideas underpinning the climax were a bit too familiar. But his performance anchors the whole movie: a still, calm centre with the pure physical ease and charm of an intergalactic Gary Cooper. The film is itself an almighty power surge.• Ad Astra is released in the UK on 18 September, in Australia on 19 September and in the US on 20 September.

Unfortunately, most meals are just quite pleasantI was a restaurant reviewer for 10 years, and then I was let go, as they say. I expected to be distraught because I would miss the money, and also the food. Instead, it was an incredible relief. Reviewing food is fine when you hate a lot of things it is fine when you stand ready and willing to do an elaborate and caustic hit job on an orange sorbet because you have been either absolutely loving or completely hating relatively benign things since you could talk. It is fine when you have quite a dedicated moral architecture of taste, when you admire good food so much that you can summon real dismay at even its very slight inferior. The problem is not that you run out of words for the best of it, nor that you take no demonic enjoyment from having unearthed the worst.The problem is the smörgåsbord of food that is just tasty. It’s not an angel dancing on your tongue it didn’t crack open your understanding of what a vegetable should be, or its meaning in the universe it wasn’t like an explosion, or an epiphany it didn’t have the deep, resonating familiarity that brought you so close to the quiddity of a steak that you felt as if you could speak cow just by eating it. It’s just tasty – or quite tasty.Food critics hate the word “tasty” the way theatre critics hate the word “moving”. Of course it’s moving – that’s what it’s there for. Moving how? And I can see their point, but what if it is just tasty? I know the answer, by the way if it’s no better than that, you just have to work harder at hating it. The whole enterprise must be envisaged by your most histrionic tendencies as a banjo duel between you and the chef: she is trying to find nine ways to reinvent an onion, you are trying to find nine words to describe it. But what kind of a monster, handed a perfectly tasty plate of pasta, with a bit of chilli and some bouncy, tasty olives, could hate it? It’s just so tasty!Cookbook writers are off that hook. They are not required to rhapsodise about how delicious anything will be – that would be boastful. But they are in the unenviable position of having to mythologise the ingredients. Beans are always humble, cabbage and parsnips always earthy. The animal kingdom is always magnificent, but they can’t overdo its majesty in case people feel bad that it is no longer alive. How are they so readable, with so many constraints? Because the best of them are like short stories – over in a flash, tantalisingly low on detail, peculiarly evocative – like Victorian erotica, mainly gripping because you can’t actually see anything. I like seasonality well enough, the dappling light on a fruit tree, the smell of a flatbread under a hot sun, Christmas spices against the cold. But what I really want to know, from a food writer, is what they are actually like. What kind of friend they are, what kind of parent, what kind of offspring, what kind of spouse – that way I will know if it’s going to be, you know, tasty.The axiom in general writing is that humour seems like an aside, but is actually always in the centre: that is what makes you trust the author. That is how you can believe the bits that aren’t funny. In food writing, you find the beating heart in what they did to a quail (Nigella) or a pea shoot (Rowley Leigh), an egg (Delia Smith), or 60 langoustines that all had to be slain one by one (Richard Olney). Your conclusions (Nigella has a heart as hot as a furnace Leigh is a barrel-full of urbane mischief Smith is the ground zero of moral certainty and may even be a saint Olney is a tortured soul who lies awake at night wondering if mousse is the right thing to do to an artichoke) could be right or wrong. The important thing is that some confluence of food and words made you able to draw them.Yasmin Alibhai-Brown made this explicit leap from recipe to self-reveal with The Settler’s Cookbook, tracing her family’s journey from India to Britain, via Idi Amin’s Uganda, but, more importantly, the diaspora experiences of the dishes that went with them. Cooking from that book always feels presumptuous, like trying on someone else’s heirlooms while they’re in the toilet. But it is also so evocative, like being almost able to smell someone else’s childhood.Food historians have one over on everyone, with their deep anthropological purpose: nobody’s really talking about a Roman’s way with corn to get you to taste it, or the fact that orphan waifs used to squash themselves between diners in Tudor times so that you, too, can try gorging on someone else’s leftover gristle. They do it (the book everyone raves about is Margaret Visser’s Much Depends on Dinner) to hurtle you back through centuries. Unfortunately – and I’ll go to the wall over this conclusion – humans are at their least interesting when they are eating they are only really interesting when they are killing each other."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a706bd8f15a879f8bb66efc57050d8ba95ad712b/0_1171_6712_4028/master/6712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0929f4d5cb2ac3b91fef2653ce2d02ab","title":"how to make summer pudding recipe felicity cloake","story":"Snap up bargain berries and snaffle the last of the crop from the hedgerows and make this seasonal filling, fruity classicSummer pudding is an old-fashioned and peculiarly British pleasure – a solid lump of stodge designed to be enjoyed when our berries are at their world-class peak. Well chilled, however, it’s surprisingly refreshing stuff, and refreshingly thrifty as well – the perfect home for that stale loaf and those over-ripe berries going cheap at the market.Butter, to greaseHalf a loaf of slightly stale, good-quality white bread225g redcurrants675g raspberries2–3 tbsp caster sugarIf your bread is obstinately fresh, very lightly toast it before use, or it may disintegrate under the weight of the fruit juices. There are advocates for cheap white sliced here, but, like brioche, I find it too soft and squidgy for the purpose. Decent white bread is the way to go, but do try to get it machine-sliced, if possible, because it will make for a neater finish.If you can’t get machine-sliced, cut the loaf into medium slices, then cut off the crusts and set aside to make breadcrumbs (or feed them to the dog). With a little butter, grease a pudding basin or a deep bowl with a capacity of about a litre (measure this by filling it with water, then tipping it into a measuring jug).Line the inside of the basin all over with a single layer of bread, cutting it as necessary to make a base and fitting it around the sides without any gaps. Finally, make a lid in the same way, but leave this off for the time being. Set the basin aside while you prepare the filling.After removing any stalks, put the fruit (sweet raspberries and sharp redcurrants are the classic combo here, but they’re not the only choice – see step 9) in a small pan with the sugar and bring to a very gentle simmer over a medium-low heat – give it a bit of a stir now and then, to help dissolve the sugar, but try to keep the berries intact.Taste and add more sugar, or a squeeze of lemon juice or wine vinegar, if you think it necessary (remember, the bread is fairly bland, so you can get away with strong flavours here). Then, gently spoon the fruit into the bread-lined basin and pour over most of the syrup, reserving any excess fruit or juices for serving.Put the bread lid on top of the fruit filling, then put a plate on top of that and weigh it down with some tins or something else heavy. Once it feels cool to the touch, transfer to the fridge, still weighted down, and chill for at least four hours, and ideally overnight, to give the fruit and bread a chance to mingle.Remove the weight and plate, and put a large serving plate (one with a pronounced lip is advisable, to keep all the juices in check) over the top. Very carefully turn over the basin, give it a sharp tap on the base and around the sides, then lift off to reveal the pudding.Pour the reserved syrup over the top of the pudding (this is particularly useful for covering any pale patches where the juices haven’t quite soaked in evenly) and arrange any leftover fruit artistically on top a few mint leaves also look nice, if you have some to hand. Serve at once with a generous jug of cool double cream.Summer pudding can be made with a variety of fruit, including blackcurrants and blackberries, and even defrosted frozen fruit, though that will tend to break down into a coulis on heating, so fresh is preferable. I also like to add a dash of rosewater to the fruit, but you could substitute liqueur (sloe gin, for example), orange zest or vanilla sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3867f9fc8348e63baddfdb12aa117eb984f9cc60/0_131_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5614949c2458124e64594a946cfc2abd","title":"atletico madrid juventus champions league match report","story":"The clock showed 89.30 when Kieran Trippier’s corner bent into the penalty area and Héctor Herrera, a second-half substitute, leapt into the air to head the ball into the net. It was loud enough already, but somehow the sound reached another level. From 2-0 down, Atlético Madrid had come back to draw 2-2 with Juventus, Diego Simeone screaming down on the touchline, supporters shouting all around him. It had been quite a way to start the European season – and it was almost taken from them, too, when Cristiano Ronaldo flashed a shot just wide deep into injury time.One hundred and 10 days later, the Champions League returned to the politano. Only one player remained from the night that Liverpool won their sixth European Cup here and the early signs were that Trippier might enjoy this night rather more than that one. Yes, he had Cristiano Ronaldo in front of him, but … well, that wasn’t entirely true: most of the time he had Ronaldo behind him. For all the cliches about Atlético, Trippier’s duties at his new club are far from solely defensive. Diego Simeone’s full-backs are pushed very high and very wide, sought out early and often.Within five minutes, there had been four crosses already – two from Trippier, two from Renan Lodi on the other side – and that pattern continued. While Lodi ran at Juventus, Trippier tended to sneak in behind Alex Sandro, an eye always on the passing line that could reach him.Together, they saw a lot of the ball as Atlético carried the weight of the game, Thomas Partey leading them out from deep, Diego Costa running, and Koke providing that moment of pause in possession that made sense of it all.Twice José Giménez leapt for headers and a cross that the Englishman stood up found João Felix close in by the far post, only for Wojciech Szczesny to save.In truth, though, that was a simple enough stop and there were few real chances. A Ronaldo shot bounced a little awkwardly but didn’t concern Jan Oblak, Giménez headed away Miralem Pjanic’s effort, and Blaise Matuidi scuffed his shot horribly, laughed at by thousands.The one genuine save of the first half came from Szczesny, when João Felix started a superb run 20 yards inside his own half. At one point he had five opponents around him in a circle but he turned, slowed, started again, and progressed into the area, working just enough space to release a shot with his toe. The former Arsenal keeper was down sharply to his left. From the corner, Giménez’s header came close.And then a goal came, just two minutes into the second half. Trippier slotted the ball into Costa but he lost out and there, from just outside his own area, Leonardo Bonucci bent a long, long pass up the left with the outside of his boot. Suddenly, Gonzalo Higuaín was racing away. Ronaldo was running through the middle to join him. And Juan Cuadrado was heading up the right. As Atlético’s players dashed back, Higuaín slowed, and played it behind the returning reinforcements to the Colombian, who cut back and struck a superb left-footed shot, bending into the top corner past the striped shirts.Danilo wasted the chance to make it two, his shot harmless when a pass to Ronaldo, alone at the far post, might have been deadly. Atlético’s next move should have been, and they paid for it almost immediately. A wonderful exchange between Koke, Stefan Savic and Trippier worked the game’s clearest opportunity for Giménez, via five, sharp first-time passes, but he was forced to reach back a little for the ball and the shot from close range flew over the crossbar.There was only time for the referee to go down, hit in the face by a wild Sami Khedira hack, before Cuadrado and Ronaldo sent Sandro away. His cross was perfect, an invitation that Matuidi accepted, heading past Oblak. Hope returned fast, Savic heading in from Koke’s free-kick to set up the finale and turn the noise up loud."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab187d8f312fae4ee3151772e40f86ab54256b42/0_30_1303_782/master/1303.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af4050351c620fc8ccf3664f0246489f","title":"paris saint germain real madrid champions league match report","story":"This was not a night for galácticos, old or new. At a balmy Parc Des Princes Paris Saint-Germain simply overran Real Madrid, pulling apart the hastily-stitched seams of Zinedine Zidane’s team and producing surely the most coherent and powerful performance of Thomas Tuchel’s time in charge.It felt like a humiliation at times – and by the end perhaps something more, a Viking funeral for a team, an era, a way of trying to win. As the seconds ran out there was even the unexpected sight of the Paris full‑backs Juan Bernat and Thomas Meunier bearing down on the Real goal, the midfield crumbling away like a sheet of millefeuille pastry, the defence drowning in all that space.Bernat took the ball from Meunier. Meunier took it back from Bernat. Meunier might have paused to drink in a most unexpected moment in his own career, but instead steered the ball into the corner of the Real net with a brusque, merciful haste to complete a 3-0 win.And make no mistake, Real stunk the place out in Paris. This was the bones of the same team that completed that unprecedented (in modern times) trio of Champions League wins just 16 months ago. But they were dreadful in the most profound sense dreadful in a way that seems to ask other questions. Such as, what is the point of this Real Madrid team? What is it trying to be? And when will it stop?By the end Luka Jovic, Eden Hazard and Vinícius Júnior had all taken to the pitch. What do these disparate, talented players have in common? How do they fit into a system? Are they anything more £200m worth of expensively assembled whim, a Premier League star here, a Brazilian tyro over there, a Balkan poacher on top?Le Match Des Etoiles! Before kick-off it was pretty clear how French television wanted to pitch this Group A opener, although in the event Neymar, Mbappé, Edinson Cavani and Julian Draxler were all either injured or suspended. Sport may be cruel but it also has an agreeably arch sense of humour. Instead football’s glitziest new-build attack took on Real Madrid spearheaded by Mauro Icardi, on loan from Internazionale, with Erik Choupo-Moting providing back-up from the bench.Madrid were also depleted, but still strong enough to line up with a sub-tier of the merely very expensive and celebrated, with Gareth Bale, Hazard and Karim Benzema in the forward line. This was a night when neither of these teams really seemed to need another industrial-scale superstar. Instead it was the vigour and drive of the PSG midfield that left the 13-time champions looking ragged, with Marco Verratti a brilliantly spiky little playmaker, and Idrissa Gueye gleefully relentless in his pressing and covering.PSG took charge from the start. Bernat produced one thrilling early surge inside Dani Carvajal. It was from there the breakthrough would come. With 14 minutes gone Bernat made the same run, this time feeding the ball into Icardi, then taking a lovely little flick into his path. The pull-back found Ángel Di María. His finish was hard and low, billowing the net from a tight angle.The PSG ultras erupted, a sea of flare-lighting, shirts-off delirium. Who needs £500m of attacking talent when you’ve got an overlapping full-back and a toe-poked near-post finish? PSG had come to press and harry this stately Madrid midfield and at times Gueye and Marquinhos were a blur of malevolent white. With half an hour gone Icardi crash-tackled his way through three Madrid players just to force a goal-kick. On his touchline Tuchel applauded furiously. He may dress like a groovy sixth-form drama teacher but Tuchel loves to see collisions, well-drilled force and endless running in his teams.It was a surge down the right from Gueye that teed up the second goal, the ball fed into Di María, who fizzed a wonderful left-footed shot into the corner from the edge of the area. And for a while as half-time approached PSG threatened to overwhelm Madrid, swarming forward in tight little units, passing the ball with speed and verve.Zidane had to find a way of reversing the gravity of this game. Hazard had been an interested observer in the first half. He dropped deeper to take the ball after the break, but still looked like what he is, a player shaking off the fog of an injury absence.PSG were still hungry. Di María scooped a horribly casual finish over the bar when he might have buried it. Tuchel raged and beat his chest as he stormed back to the bench, but his team kept coming on a night when that air of born-to-rule assurance seemed to have passed, for now, to PSG.It comes to something when a cash-drenched nation-state football project is handing out lessons on the virtues of careful team-building, but Tuchel will be rightly proud of his team’s drive and certainty here. Madrid, for their part, just looked like a mess a superstar vehicle that has, for now, run out of miles to travel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d48ea831a3cc20684fcd33a571d4c614f0c2c49/0_92_5040_3023/master/5040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=869311925eb6827d722f74119a6c29d9","title":"shakhtar donetsk manchester city champions league match report","story":"In the context of a defensive crisis caused by injuries to centre-backs Aymeric Laporte and John Stones, this was a particularly fine display from Manchester City.Pep Guardiola’s team could have claimed victory in this opening Group C game by double the scoreline and there was little beyond the usual alarms expected at this level to concern a patched-up rearguard.“Fernandinho can play in any position but it is impossible for them to play every few days. The next options are Eric García and Taylor Harwood‑Bellis and they are teenagers.”Fernandinho’s inclusion was one of four changes from Norwich. The others were the Silvas – Bernardo and David – who were replaced by Kevin De Bruyne and Riyad Mahrez, plus Sergio Agüero, replaced by Gabriel Jesus.Luís Castro’s Shakhtar side was as expected, lining up in their familiar 4-2‑3‑1 with Júnior Moraes, one of the Ukrainian team’s five Brazilians, the lone striker. Within seconds of kick-off Rodri managed to miss with a header when scoring appeared easier, Serhiy Bolbat having fouled Raheem Sterling along City’s left.After that, the visitors found a killer fluidity, the superb Ilkay Gündogan creating their opener. De Bruyne won a tackle on the edge of the area and when the ball found Gabriel Jesus, Gündogan smacked it off Andriy Pyatov’s right post and Mahrez was there to turn home a first goal of the season.This did not tame the home side, though. Instead they came at City in waves that had a concerned Guardiola prowling his technical area. When Taison nutmegged Rodri he tore forward and slid the ball to Júnior Moraes. The noise in the stadium surged as the No 10 pulled the trigger but Ederson’s save kept City’s lead intact.It was about to be doubled, and this was City at their best. Rodri pinged a pass to Mahrez whose control was instant. He moved forward, found Gündogan making a sweetly timed run, and the No 8 made no mistake.The half ended with Sterling setting up Mahrez, though his effort ballooned over, before a late scare for City was ended when Fernandinho blocked Júnior Moraes’s finish towards an empty net.For the second half Castro took off Manor Solomon for Yevhen Konoplyanka, the Israeli having failed to make an impact, and Donetsk soon had a golden chance to pull one back.Ederson misjudged a charge out to the ball allowing Júnior Moraes to aim a lob towards an empty net, but the effort went wide. Almost instantly Gündogan went close at the other end, but the midfielder was unable to finish.The same player overran the ball when put clean through from a Sterling pass, the mistake causing Guardiola to throw his hands in the air – the manager was conscious one more goal would finish it.Considering the defeat at Norwich and loss of Laporte and Stones, this was moving towards the kind of assured evening Guardiola wanted. Confirmation came when Jesus scored, and there was even a late cameo for Benjamin Mendy, making his first appearance since April.On Saturday Watford are the visitors when Guardiola’s new central defence will be tested for the first time in the Premier League. He may be relieved that injury to Troy Deeney, a centre-forward who rarely gives defenders an easy time, means Fernandinho will at least not have to deal with him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975910bbad0ea86c1e2f116271b17103b08832b3/581_0_1003_602/master/1003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5d457ce7f9760e6e23347a3c8dabfc","title":"we didnt respect the plan pochettino disappointed with tottenham draw","story":"Mauricio Pochettino accused his Tottenham players of lacking fight in the 2-2 Champions League draw at Olympiakos and suggested that they needed to work harder on the psychological side of their game.Spurs started badly at the raucous Karaiskakis Stadium only to fashion a 2-0 lead against the run of play – courtesy of Harry Kane’s penalty and a rasping drive from Lucas Moura.But as they had done at Arsenal in the Premier League at the beginning of the month, conceded for 2-1 just before half-time – a body blow to their psyche – and then shipped an equaliser after the interval. After the match, Pochettino did not hold back with his criticism.“I feel very disappointed,” the manager said. “In the first half, I wasn’t happy with the performance. From the beginning we had a plan, and we didn’t respect the plan. That’s what disappointed me the most. I told them at half-time. We scored two good goals but if you analyse the performance only, it wasn’t great.Pochettino was asked about the similarities to the Arsenal game. “It’s easy to explain. When we don’t show the intensity that the competition demands, we struggle. We are not talking about the quality of players. We are talking about focus, concentration, anticipation. How many times did we anticipate the action? How many times were we not productive like we were against Palace?“It’s not about tactics or quality players but the level of fight. You need to match the opponent in aggressivity, excitement, motivation. That is the first demand – you need to work. It’s not only the responsibility of one person it’s everyone’s responsibility.“It is not possible how we started tonight and it is a massive difference to Saturday. It’s a massive disappointment. We can talk about scoring twice and playing better second half, but this season we are conceding a lot of chances and a lot of goals. We need to change that. The only way is to be more demanding. Training needs to be harder. Psychologically harder.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c90fd30cd477514999b33c6b7bb3f872aeba5908/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1569c295da6d1e297ba36b2f3cc4db8","title":"women looking unapproachable could be your greatest asset","story":"Meeting the world with a ‘resting bitch face’ may not be what society demands, but it protects you against unsolicited male attention in publicWith girls as young as 13 years old now opting for Botox, it is clear that ageing is no longer the only thing women are trying to ward off. An article in the New York Post has noted a rise in women seeking plastic surgery to “fix” their so-called “resting bitch face”. This is a women-only affliction, where, even when wearing a neutral expression, you appear perpetually standoffish. In reality, it refers to any time that a woman’s facial expression is set in anything less than a smile.According to one doctor quoted in the piece, the number of requests for the procedure have more than doubled in the past year. This isn’t exactly shocking – women are made to feel bad about just about everything in terms of their appearance – but to me it seems many of these women are getting rid of something that is actually a great asset.In a world where simply being a woman is considered an invitation for unsolicited comments and unwarranted conversation from complete strangers, looking unfriendly is useful armour. It can, at times, be the only barrier between a woman and unwanted small talk on the tube, or a bar. Or on a run. Or on the high street. Or a public bench. Or even while in the middle of conversation with someone else. Heckling and catcalling are rife – should we not at least be allowed to look less than pleased about it?But that would grossly overestimate the amount of emotional intelligence and shame some men have. Because, like anything else, looking grim-faced can be, in and of itself, an invitation. If I had a quid for each of the times I have heard: “Smile, love, it might never happen” shouted at me across the street, I might have the money to rid myself of my own “resting bitch face”. When men say this, it never seems to occur to them that whatever the “it” in question is, it has probably already happened – one look at the world around you should be enough to realise there is often little to smile about. Yet Victoria Beckham’s signature scowl and Kristen Stewart’s tendency to mean-mug have merely culminated in more column inches requesting they turn that frown upside down or, at least, into something that is slightly less offputting.What all this tells us is that women must be amiable and approachable by default. Even when we’re not interacting, we must be poised and primed to do so. Tellingly, there is no “resting grumpy bastard face” equivalent for men – people are far less concerned about faces they don’t deem public property."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ffeac2e0923b2d15ea9af0b985ea4d0218ccd1c/0_0_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f69bb1d4d9c32a325322db821a8e04","title":"celebrate the day how to plan a gathering at the last minute","story":"Summer is the season for spontaneity, so why not make the most of bright days and long nights with a spur-of-the-moment do? Here’s our guide to making it a night to rememberWhen was the last time you had an impromptu get-together? There’s always a good reason not to. On Friday night, you’re tired from work. Saturday comes, and you just want to relax after a busy week. And on Sunday, well, it’s Monday tomorrow!But there are really so many reasons to organise a do at short notice, from a surprise bank holiday heatwave to keeping the holiday vibes going after you’ve returned from a sunny beach trip abroad. To make sure your last-minute shindig is one to remember, here are a few tips to elevate your soiree without breaking a sweat.Curate the guest listForget Facebook. In 2019 we WhatsApp. Forming a WhatsApp group for your party creates a space for invitees who don’t know each other to break the ice, and keeps your guest list to only people who know you well enough to have their number, not whoever you feel obliged to add as you scroll through every person you’ve ever met since 2006. If two invitees are exes, invite both, tell them to discuss who (if not both) should attend, and assure them they’ll both be ejected if they start rowing in the kitchen. As far as inviting colleagues goes, best to limit it to people in your after-work drinks crew.Choose a second-in-commandPerhaps the most important tip is to select a good friend to help you keep an eye on food and drink, playlist coups, general tidying and other party admin to keep your own stress levels low. They can even subtly begin the party exodus on your command, so long as they’re the sort of pal you can turn to and say: “Right, I’ve had enough, get everyone out now.” We all need a friend like that.Democratise the playlistThere’s nothing more irritating than guests commandeering the music, but once the drinks have started flowing, people will inevitably try their luck. Avoid this by inviting your guests to help with the playlist. Ask each to send a couple of suggestions when they confirm they’re coming, whack it all together on Spotify and then dilute it with your own picks – it’s your party, you deserve that.Don’t be precious over glassesYou can get those plastic throwaway champagne flutes and martini glasses nowadays, but frankly it’s a waste of money and plastic. We’re in Britain, so chances are your household will have at least 20 perfectly useable mugs of varying taste levels in your cupboards, and anyone who judges you for using these shouldn’t be on the guestlist in the first place. There’s enough plastic being dumped into the world without you adding extra because you can’t be bothered to wash up at the end of your do – and that’s what the aforementioned second-in-command is for, anyway.Encourage photography, not selfiesInstagram is a wonderful thing, but in the age of Stories, selfies and #squadlife, it’s easy to forget that photos used to be something you had to wait for. That is, you had to finish a roll of film, then go and get it developed, and all with no idea of what the results would look like. But that was part of the fun of course, and – dare I say it – encouraged people to take better, more spontaneous and authentic photos. So, rather than posing for endless posts, why not pick up four or five disposable cameras and distribute them among your friends to take pics throughout the evening? The classic Kodak single-use is still great for colour shots, or for a touch of perennial monochrome cool, try Ilford’s range of black and white disposables.Make some nibbles to rememberIt’s really easy to make simple food feel a bit fancy with just a few additions. Fill paper cups with salted popcorn mixed with spices like za’atar and sumac for a warming, Middle Eastern twist, or toss some walnut halves in a pan with soy sauce to make a crunchy salad topping brimming with umami. You can also roast broccoli with olive oil, salt, garlic, fresh chilli and lemon juice for plant-based finger food that’s surprisingly tasty – and won’t have your guests feeling lethargic a couple of hours after eating. A homemade dip is an easy way to impress too – tzatziki is a personal favourite, and I like to use Nigel Slater’s recipe, minus the dill.Don’t forget the detailsIt’s the little things that make a party flow: lime wedges stored in the fridge, waiting to be plopped into drinks wifi password shared before guests arrive extra toilet paper lots of – and I can’t stress this enough – kitchen roll and sun cream! Try and pre-empt the sorts of details guests might need during the party, and have them out, ready and signposted. If nothing else, it’ll stop them interrupting you in the middle of dancing to Beyoncé.Check out some more cocktail recipes at greygoose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc82f3153cf44cac67da6e0a97f0fb59fea9a838/59_0_834_500/master/834.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b8a0a393d903616c74bd519b77eed59","title":"its about the morning afters why the joy of friendship isnt found in the big moments","story":"Great friendships aren’t forged on the big nights out, but the spontaneous moments when the phones are forgotten about, and conversation and laughter flows freely, says Lauren BravoMy best friend and I live on opposite sides of London, but we share a hairdresser. Once every two months, she makes the 90-minute journey to my flat and we both have our highlights done by Lesley, the fastest bleaching brush in the west. While she works, we gossip and cackle and unpack every idle thought and silly piece of trivia we’ve forgotten to tell each other during the intervening weeks. Afterwards we preen, we put music on and she goes through my bedroom and tries on my clothes. For a few hours it feels as though we’re teenagers again. Only with much better hair.Increasingly I’m realising it’s these small, informal moments-between-moments that really make a friendship. The getting-readys. The morning-afters. The shall-we-just-stay-ins.Far and away my favourite moment of freshers’ week at university was the night I spent holed up in a halls of residence dorm room watching a DVD of Fawlty Towers, with a group of new friends who, like me, had elected to skip the Crazy Wild West Hoedown happening in the campus bar downstairs. While everyone else cavorted in panic-bought Stetsons to Cotton Eye Joe, we watched Basil being hit unconscious by the falling moose’s head and congratulated ourselves on our choices.Those new friends went on to become my housemates, my pub quiz team, my unofficial counsellors and confidantes. They’re the people with whom I have staged a gleeful fake Christmas every December for the past 12 years, the festivities growing marginally more civilised as our lives have (we eat our turkey dinner around a table now – not, as in 2009, out of saucepans while sat on the stairs). And when we reminisce, our favourite memories are never the big-ticket items. End of year balls? Fine. Graduation? Cool, I suppose. But the spontaneous kitchen dance parties? Legendary. Likewise the best part of a big night out was rarely the night itself it was the Bloody Marys with brunch the next day, that clink of ice and hit of pepper, as we pieced together everyone’s juicy titbits from the night before like a great big gossip jigsaw.It’s how so many of my most cherished friendships were forged – not in life-changing experiences, but in leisurely hours spent talking nonsense, howling with laughter at nothing in particular. It’s easy to feel affection for everyone in the dazzle of a Big Life Moment, or the warmth of its afterglow. But it’s on the ordinary days, the rainy days and Mondays, that you find your true ride-or-dies.And that’s especially true as you get older. As people disperse across cities, counties, even countries, and friendship has to be increasingly meted out between the Big Life Moments the weddings, the birthday drinks, the housewarmings and baby showers. When the casual, everyday chit-chat we used to take for granted gets relegated to WhatsApp groups and Instagram likes, and IRL meet-ups have to be scheduled weeks in advance. Idling away time together becomes a rare luxury, while savouring it becomes all the more important. No longer the easy proximity and empty diaries, which meant you could fill an evening with one magic word: “pub?”The significant milestones can give you lovely reasons to celebrate, sure – but they can also pile on the pressure. How many times have you heard happy couples lament that they barely had a chance to exchange more than two words with their friends on their wedding day, before being swept away by a wave of excitable aunts? The hen weekends where you’re so stressed about the logistics of getting everyone from the pottery class to the knicker-making workshop that you forget to have a good time. The dinners where it takes so long to catch up on everyone’s top-line news that you’re still discussing mortgage rates and maternity leave by the time the bill comes. If we rely on the Big Life Moments to bring us together, we risk missing out on the deeper conversations and the daft interludes, both of which can make even the most ordinary of days feel like a special occasion.So it’s important to remember all of the other ways you connect with people – and the other people you connect with. Maybe it’s the friend who drags you to their weird evening class once a month, and rewards you with a good cocktail afterwards. The pal who will get up at dawn to drive to a car boot sale, then talk you out of buying a three-foot high stuffed fox (“it’s kitsch!”). Your film buff mate who will come over to watch arty foreign-language flicks with an armful of continental cheeses, knowing you’re both going to talk the whole way through, Espresso Martinis in hand. Your Eurovision crew, your board games gang, your summer solstice picnic posse. Here’s an idea: every time you say “we should do this every weekmonthyear!”, why not try … actually doing that? Leave your phone in your bag. Skip the administrative catch-up and talk about whatever crosses your mind instead. Let a nothingy Tuesday night mean as much, if not more than celebrating a birthday, an engagement or promotion – and mix up some suitably convivial cocktails to match. Blood Orange Sangrias, anyone?Don’t hang around waiting for the next Big Life Moment to get together with your friends. Because every shared evening, every new in-joke and every Seemingly Inconsequential Pow-wow (SIP?) is absolutely worth toasting, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93d492e39e5f9c7fa0597dfc3a4a0ac9fd0f2b2b/0_1027_3089_1854/master/3089.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36fa1d06a44189862e7f57ad36f577c0","title":"credit card spending overtakes cash for first time","story":"Credit card spending has overtaken cash for the first time, according to data from UK retailers.

We recognise the unique history and geography, I think to go back to my language of 10 August,” she said.“We have to recognise that we are in the UK and sometimes I think people forget that.”She said her party was looking for a “sensible deal” and it never wanted to inflict no deal on the region.“The presentation of the DUP as a ‘no deal’ party is wrong. People get very alarmed when they see that sort of rhetoric, We do want to see a deal but it has to be a deal that works for everybody,” she said.The backstop has the support of industry and farmers, who have said that no deal could have disastrous outcomes for Northern Ireland. The Stormont economy department has said it could cost 40,000 jobs.The letter could be characterised as a plea for a soft Brexit. It envisaged a deal that would ensure new arrangements did not disrupt the peace process and accommodated the “particular significance for the agri-food sector and animal health” in border regions.It also noted it was critical that businesses were protected on the border and did not incur additional costs, suggesting the DUP could accept regulatory alignment if a Stormont assembly had a say in what EU rules would apply.In a separate interview with RTE, Foster said the so-called Stormont lock – a promise to consult the Northern Ireland assembly on any no-deal arrangements – was being misrepresented as a veto on future EU regulations.“We’re not looking for any control over the European Union, what we are looking for is control over what happens in Northern Ireland and I think that’s a very fair thing to search for,” she said.The DUP is hoping a shift in its position will be met with a compromise by the EU and the Republic of Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90b6f7e976d4f6275047584af31288451549c78e/227_468_3694_2216/master/3694.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1708d394bec60cba8925b107244d06a5","title":"david cameron sought intervention from queen on scottish independence","story":"Former PM admits he wanted ‘raised eyebrow’ from monarch in referendum campaignDavid Cameron has revealed that he suggested to the Queen’s private secretary how the monarch could influence the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, before she went on to make an intervention that was widely seen as helping a faltering pro-union campaign.Cameron, as prime minister, was on a weekend break at the Balmoral estate in the Scottish Highlands in September 2014 when a YouGov survey put the campaign for Scottish independence in the lead for the first time.In the second part of a BBC series about his life in politics, which is to be broadcast next week, Cameron says the poll hit him “like a blow to the solar plexus” and led to “a mounting sense of panic”.He says: “I remember conversations I had with my private secretary and he had with the Queen’s private secretary and I had with the Queen’s private secretary, not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even you know a quarter of an inch, we thought would make a difference.”The equivalent of a raised eyebrow came a week later when, outside Crathie Kirk, the church where the Queen attends Sunday services while at Balmoral, a woman disclosed in widely reported remarks that the monarch had offered a coded warning about the impending referendum, telling her: “Well, I hope people will think very carefully about the future.”While the  has reported that Sir Jeremy Heywood, then cabinet secretary, and Sir Christopher Geidt, then the Queen’s private secretary, had discussed how she might register her concern at the prospect of a yes vote for independence while remaining “impartial”, Cameron’s remarks are an explicit admission that he sought intervention.The remarks are likely to be provoke the ire of Scottish nationalists.Pete Wishart, a Scottish National party MP, said there was no doubt the Queen’s remarks had an impact on Scottish voters, particularly those who had not decided which way to vote. “We knew Cameron was up to something at the time and for him to explicitly chronicle how he approached it, almost strategically, is almost beyond belief,” Wishart said.The revelation is potentially the most controversial element of the programme Cameron Years, the first episode of which will be broadcast on Thursday with a focus on the lead-up to the referendum on Britain’s EU membership.George Osborne, chancellor of the exchequer in Cameron’s government, is particularly critical of Cameron’s approach, saying: “David Cameron was just one of a number of British prime ministers who had fed this idea that we were different than Europe, that Brussels was to blame, and that the public ultimately had to have a say – and we’ve all paid a price for it in my view.”Osborne and Cameron have also spoken openly about the increasingly fraught attempts to convince Michael Gove to be on their side. Gove tells the programme that he felt “some of the conversations we had were attempts on his part to reassure himself that our friendship would mean that I wouldn’t stray from the fold”.Others involved in the Tory government at the time also speak of how the emotional ties due to the closeness of Cameron’s family with Gove’s family had an effect on decision-making, coming to a bitter head when Gove, then education secretary, was demoted. Gove was moved in the reshuffle of summer 2014 to the post of chief whip. Cameron says Gove had wanted to become chief whip and speaks of his surprise when the other sent him an email in the midst of the reshuffle saying that he did not want that job.David Laws, a Liberal Democrat minister in the coalition government, tells the programme that the consequences of the breakdown of the relationship between Cameron and Gove were enormous for the future of the country.“Quite simply,” he says, “we might never have had that referendum vote to leave the European Union without Michael’s demotion in 2014.”In a preview of the series this week, at the BBC, the executive producer Denys Blakeway said that during hours of interviews Cameron was asked if he felt any remorse over the EU referendum. The former prime minister chose deliberately, he said, to use the word “regret” instead.Boris Johnson had agreed to be interviewed for the programme but cancelled on two occasions, according to Blakeway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67fb0cc03de0a88545ea1e36eca6b97d9865f43d/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c6695ec275647fc71d2000474dac99f","title":"labour to review language of tony blairs clause iv reform","story":"Party to set up working group, as long as Scottish activists withdraw conference motionLabour has promised to look again at clause IV of its constitution, which sets out the aims and values of the party, leading to speculation the party could revert to its pre-Blair commitment to socialism.The party’s ruling body has said it will set up a working group to look at updating the language in the clause controversially replaced by Tony Blair in 1995, in what was seen as a milestone moment for the direction of the party.However, they will only do so if a constituency Labour party (CLP) motion on the matter which has been tabled for the party’s conference in Brighton – which begins on Saturday – is withdrawn.A Labour source said it would be premature to say clause IV was being redeveloped but that the party would set up a group to consider its wording on the proviso that members of the Dundee CLP drop their motion.The Scottish activists want “the restoration of the pre-1995” version which includes the line: “To secure for the workers by hand or by brain the full fruits of their industry and the most equitable distribution thereof that may be possible upon the basis of common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange.”Blair changed the 1917 wording as part of his New Labour vision, to instead talk of a “dynamic economy” to produce the wealth the nation needs. It was seen as a signifiant break from leftwing economic thinking.A Labour source said: “This is jumping the gun. The NEC is asking the proposers to withdraw the motion. If they do not, the NEC will recommend it is opposed.”Withdrawing the motion avoids it potentially dominating discussions at conference, which Labour’s leadership may find distracting from its main policy areas.However, the fact the party’s ruling body has decided it is willing to discuss the clause in certain circumstances, is in itself a significant development for members who are keen to see the historic elements of the constitution return, such as a commitment to nationalisation.Labour is keen to stress that any changes to clause IV would be a rule change, and may not get the endorsement of the NEC, or in future be put to a vote of the membership at a party conference.The former Labour home secretary Alan Johnson told the Times that going back to the old version would be a “final triumph over Blairism” for leader Jeremy Corbyn.He warned the former clause was a product of 1917 and would not be fit for today’s party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c55007810f2b4f7c29b5ad4a73a58e7aa2a6ec5/0_400_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23cd43cf058062dfef582ca2021cacbd","title":"dust cloud sparked explosion in primitive life on earth say scientists","story":"Smashing of monster asteroid half a billion years ago thought to have caused mini ice ageAn enormous dust cloud that swept through the ancient solar system sent Earth into a mini ice age that sparked an explosion in primitive life on the planet, scientists say.The space dust was created when a monster asteroid was smashed to pieces in a violent collision somewhere between Mars and Jupiter nearly half a billion years ago.The destruction of the 93-mile-wide space rock scattered so much dust into the inner solar system that it blocked some of the sunlight falling on Earth, the researchers claim. As a result, temperatures dropped for at least 2m years.Because the cooling occurred over such a long time, life on Earth had time to adapt. And while many species carried on unaffected in the warmer spots near the equator, others evolved to make the most of the world’s freshly-formed colder regions.“This the first time it’s been shown that dust from an asteroid break-up can lead to cooling that triggers an ice age on Earth,” said Birger Schmitz, a professor of nuclear physics at Lund University in Sweden. Evidence from rock formations suggests that Earth experienced an unusual, short-lived ice age about 466m years ago. The drop in temperature locked water into ice that covered much of the planet, causing sea levels to fall globally. The period coincided with an apparent surge in the ersity of life on the planet, most of which was still in the oceans.In the hope of shedding light on the mysterious ice age, Schmitz and his colleagues went looking for clues in ancient limestone rocks exposed at sites in southern Sweden and near St Petersburg in Russia. In particular, they looked for remnants of the huge asteroid, which geologists call the “L chondrite parent body”.The researchers used acid to dissolve more than a tonne of limestone rocks of different ages from the sites. They then picked over what was left behind. They found that after the asteroid’s destruction, the abundance of grains matching its chemical make-up rose by between 1,000 and 10,000 times. The levels stayed high for 2m-4m years. “The grains come with the dust so when you see an increase in these, you know there’s been an increase in the dust,” said Schmitz.Further tests on the ancient limestone revealed a similar spike in levels of an isotope of helium that streams out of the sun in the surge of particles known as the solar wind. The researchers believe that the helium was brought to Earth when it became embedded in the finer space dust particles as they travelled through the solar system.Writing in Science Advances, the team describes how dust and coarse-grained particles from the asteroid’s destruction rained down on Earth and became locked into sedimentary rocks. “We can nail that this ice age started to form when the dust from the break-up fell to Earth,” Schmitz said. The asteroid still accounts for about a third of the meteorites that land on Earth.Scientists call the apparent explosion in marine life at the time the Great Ordovician Bioersification Event, or GOBE. David Harper, a palaeontologist at Durham University who worked on the study, said it was “the most spectacular hike in marine ersity in the history of life.”.“Ice ages have been associated with major volcanic eruptions, but for the first time the team has implicated asteroid-derived dust in the initiation of global cooling and a major leap in bioersity that changed marine ecosystems for ever,” he added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eba8bb10d4686ac99fc92ae17ba6ab402e7a2b4/0_62_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59124025712d633bf8724207b269319c","title":"universal credit wait fuels poverty and food bank use says research","story":"Government urged to reduce five-week wait claimants must endure before first paymentMinisters have come under renewed pressure to fundamentally overhaul universal credit after fresh research claimed that the welfare benefit’s built-in five week wait for payment fuelled claimant poverty and increased food bank use.The Trussell Trust food bank network said the minimum 35-day wait for payment endured by claimants after signing on to universal credit could have a rapid, devastating and long-lasting impact on their finances, housing security and mental health.Claimants unable to cope without income during the waiting period faced destitution, Trussell said. They were unable to afford food, frequently went without meals, failed to pay utility bills, ran up rent arrears and risked eviction.The research cited the case of John, a man with severe mental illness, who did not eat for nine days after being left with no income after claiming universal credit. His health had declined to the point where he “didn’t feel well enough to leave the house to get a food bank voucher”.Government measures to mitigate the negative effects of the five-week wait were either limited or failing, Trussell said. Repayable advance loans issued to claimants to tide them over simply created long-term difficulties for claimants as they paid them back, in effect leaving them “deciding between hardship now or later”.“Universal credit should be there to anchor any of us against the tides of poverty. But the five-week wait fatally undermines this principle, pushing people into debt, homelessness and destitution,” said Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie.The scale of the problem was underlined by separate research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which estimated that that two in five families set to move on to universal credit in future – about 2m households – will be unable to meet basic living costs during the five-week wait.The foundation said there was “nothing compassionate or just” about the five-week wait for an initial payment, which it described as “immoral.” It backed Trussell’s call to shorten it, saying that universal credit was forcing families to go to food banks when it should be helping to reduce the need for them.The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) dismissed the Trussell Trust report as unsubstantiated and based on unrepresentative data, and insisted its advance loans were working as intended. “It categorically does not prove that universal credit is the reason behind increased food bank usage,” a DWP spokesperson said.Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said the five-week wait was wrong and advance loans were not the answer. “Labour will stop the rollout of universal credit and ensure that our social security system lifts people out of poverty and supports any one of us in our time of need,” she said.There are reports that the Labour party is set to announce that it will “scrap” universal credit at its annual conference next week. A year-long review of party policy is said to have recommended that it should adopt a policy of “transformative change” to make the benefit fairer.The design of universal credit built in a six-week waiting time for a first payment – later reduced to five weeks – to put claimants on to a monthly-in-arrears payment cycle, paid electronically, ostensibly to reflect the world of work. The benefits it replaces typically had a 15-day wait for payment.However, the designers seemingly failed to recognise that substantial numbers of claimants were used to one or two-week payment cycles, and few had sufficient savings to tide them over a lengthy period without income, making their transition to the new benefit an often traumatic struggle.Universal credit bundles together six working-age benefits into one monthly payment. It was originally due to be fully operational in 2017 but the current deadline is 2023, when about 7m people will depend on it. A devastating auditors’ report last year found it was unlikely to deliver planned financial savings or employment benefits.Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the Trussell data echoed its own findings. “It’s clear, from the findings across the charity sector helping universal credit claimants, that the system is not providing everyone with the financial safety net people need,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8e1432782bbf12727ac8903bc92e9740ba6e7d4/69_0_2861_1717/master/2861.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73325b08359702223b859ac46e5752ac","title":"wrestling referee dreadlocks suspended alan maloney","story":"A referee who told a New Jersey high school wrestler to cut his dreadlocks or forfeit a match last year was suspended by the state for two seasons Wednesday, and officials also announced mandatory bias training for all referees and coaches involved in high school athletics.Referee Alan Maloney, who is white, told Buena Regional high school wrestler Andrew Johnson, who identifies as multiracial, that he had to cut his hair or forfeit the match last December. A widely disseminated video showed Johnson’s hair being cut on the sidelines.The state ision on civil rights investigation found that Maloney determined that Johnson required a hair covering and gave Johnson the choice of cutting his hair or forfeiting after no covering could be located that satisfied rules governing long hair.The report concluded, however, that various New Jersey wrestling officials had interpreted the rule to apply to various traditionally black hair styles regardless of length.The agreement between the civil rights office and the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association announced Wednesday seeks to eliminate interpretations of the rule “that allowed wrestling officials to determine that traditionally Black hairstyles were ‘unnatural’ or to subject wrestlers with traditionally Black hairstyles to differential treatment as to when a hair cover was required.”As part of Wednesday’s agreement, the athletic association will provide in-person training to all wrestling officials in the state before the start of the season to emphasize that the rule in question is based on hair length, not hair style.By the end of the 2020-2021 school year, the association will provide implicit bias training to all high school officials and require schools to provide similar training to administrators, coaches and trainers.Maloney had been barred from officiating while the investigation proceeded. In March, he filed notice that he planned to sue for defamation and emotional distress. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on Wednesday. An attorney representing the Johnson family also didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.Maloney came under fire in 2016 for using a racial slur against a black referee, according to the Courier Post newspaper.

The question arises following a conversation with a former employee at a major bookmaking firm, who suggests practices in the gambling industry could breach discrimination laws.The source of the claim worked as a trader with a well-known betting brand for almost 10 years until earlier this year, says firms routinely discriminate between male and female punters from the moment they open an account, purely on the basis of their gender.The development of internet betting over the last 20 years means that modern bookmakers have many times more customers than would have been the case 20 years ago, and often process huge numbers of bets at a bewildering speed, in particular in the moments leading up to the start of a big sporting event. As a result, all firms have sophisticated systems in place to defend their margins, and restrict or refuse bets from the most successful punters.The relative unprofitability of betting accounts opened by women when compared to those of male punters is also well known in the industry. It is possible that women are simply shrewder gamblers than men, but it is also likely that traders fear accounts opened by female customers are being used as a front by “faces” – punters who have previously been banned for winning too much money.“Where I was working, when you called up the details of an account, the page was flagged up in pink if the holder was a woman so you couldn’t miss it,” the ex-trader claims. “But I don’t think this is just something that was happening where I was working. Most of the big firms use the same software, and this is something that happens industry-wide.”The Equality Act 2010 allows service providers to provide “separate” services for men and women if it is a better or more effective way to conduct their business – but only if they can demonstrate that there is a valid reason for doing so. So the question here may be whether a bookie’s fears that big-hitting winners could be hiding behind new female customers are sufficient reason to treat those customers differently “from day one” solely on the basis of their gender?LadbrokesCoral, William Hill, Bet365, BetFred and Paddy Power were all asked on Wednesday what percentage of their account holders are female and whether they are satisfied that their business practices and procedures with regard to female customers are fully compliant with current gender equality legislation.As yet, only LadbrokesCoral have responded. The make-up of our customer base varies by brand, product and territory,” a spokesperson said. “For commercial reasons we don’t disclose specific details. In all cases we abide by gender equality legislation and our communication with our customers is based on their inidual playing preferences and not their gender.”If minds need concentrating, a spokesperson for the Gambling Commission, the industry’s regulator, said on Wednesday that any breach of equality laws by gambling firms could potentially be a threat to their licence to operate.“Were licensees found to be in breach of anti-discrimination laws this would certainly reflect on their suitability to hold an operating licence,” the spokesperson said. “As the gambling regulator we expect operators to protect their customers from harm and treat them fairly.”• Comments will be turned on from around 9.30am BST"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262136c6efd3859f2da7bb137b27ea54b65694e0/0_0_500_300/master/500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ed7c3b5a48a7bf764f37b5e3f5a3cf","title":"rugby world cup 2019 fixtures tables and results","story":"Check out the full schedule and latest standings for Japan 2019Japan open the tournament against Russia at the 49,970-seater Tokyo Stadium, and will look to build on their best ever World Cup performance from four years ago, when they won three games.

Then, just as the coalition government came into power, the girl from Orpington pivoted towards outraged political comedy. She has gone on to become one of comedy’s most articulate chronicler of the left’s beleaguered decade. But what’s consistent through both incarnations and into her recent show about motherhood is a personality that fizzes with fun and – Tories be damned! – an indomitable love of life. BLTheir Brentford-set series followed a group of loserish friends, but its creators are anything but. Asim Chaudhry, Allan “Seapa” Mustafa, Steve Stamp and Hugo Chegwin gave the mockumentary a millennial spin with a web series that caught the eye of Office producers Roughcut. Over five series, the group nailed subcultural satire by drawing on their experiences in the world of garage MCing, making for a show that was authentic and absurd. With PJDN now over, the group seem to have the comedy world at their feet, with a film and a US version on its way. HJDWhile Coel’s statuesque skills have been lent to more serious thespian pursuits recently (2018’s Black Earth Rising), her self-penned series Chewing Gum was a landmark. Based around Tracey, a neurotic 24-year-old living in a tower block in London, the show had all the appeal of an Inbetweeners-era coming-of-age sitcom (such as the scene in which she tries to lose her virginity in a disabled loo). But with its misfit lead navigating her sexuality and identity, it was a revelation for a generation of black women who were previously made to feel invisible in comedy. HGHad Mindy Kaling just written and appeared on The Office (US), revitalising a flagging show with her livewire neediness, she’d make the list. Had she only written the books Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) and Why Not Me?, she’d make the list. Had she only made The Mindy Project, she’d make the list. Had she only written and starred in the Emma Thompson film Late Night, there’s a good chance she’d make the list. But she’s done all of these things, so question her place here at your peril. SHSuspend your expectations of comedy: like his hero, the great Dutch comic Hans Teeuwen, Brookes is here to scramble your sense of what’s happening on stage, what’s up next and why the hell you’re laughing. Maybe his antics – eyeballing his crowd, absenting himself, stretching his sinewy frame into odd shapes – relate to the currents of talking about incest, eco-angst and existential despair that pass for his material. Or maybe they’re just what this “hipster Nosferatu” finds funny. Either way, you can’t take your eyes off him. BLFans of the barrel-chested comic may have first witnessed him in Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace, where his poker-faced arrogance became the stuff of cult worship. His roles often come from an alternate version of the 70s - his sophisticated, Bafta-winning Toast and its excellent interior design and music being one of the most innovative comedies on TV in years. While his face does minimal work, it’s his voice – described as “part bounty hunter, part 70s porn star” – that has soothed this century, from his BBC shorts to The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, Snuff Box, House of Fools and yoghurt adverts. HGWhen Cardinal Burns arrived on the comedy circuit, it was obvious from the quality performances, the sharp script and the range of characters that Seb Cardinal and Dustin Demri-Burns had talent. When their TV break came (on E4 then Channel 4), it wasn’t just funny, it was a cinematic treat, both in how it looked, and how the sketches were like entire worlds to immerse yourself in. See their suburban Banksy, the Made in Chelsea spoof Young Dreams, and one-off sketches (their Clowns sketch is a beauty). PFHannibal Buress would almost certainly like to be known for more than just being the guy who made a joke that triggered Bill Cosby’s downfall. But in the US at least, Buress has long had a following, thanks to TV specials, late-night chatshow appearances and his role in Comedy Central sitcom Broad City. His onstage style is relaxed to the point of almost complete stillness, a sort of mumblecore standup. It is a red herring, though, as his material is astute and often fearless. PFThe Glasgow comic, real name Brian Limond, is a rare thing in comedy: a comedian not known for panel show appearances or TV roles but rather for his online notoriety. His DIY efforts led to a linear series, Limmy’s Show on BBC Scotland, but his success has largely been on his own terms (think podcasts, blogs, tweets and clips on now-deceased video service Vine). Dark, subversive, weird, sad and absurd yet universal, Limmy proves that doing it your own way – via the odd fake obituary – is a risk worth taking. HJDThe “comedian’s comedian”, Lee is known for his meandering, oddball tales and surreal projects such as Jerry Springer: The Opera. Bridging the gap between 90s standup and the present (his influence is clear on bright, bizarre young things like James Acaster), Lee’s recent show, Content Provider, tackled Brexit with brilliant amounts of bathos (“Ooh no,” he coos on stage, “I only wanted bendy bananas, and now there’s this chaotic inferno of hate!”). HJDStandup in the 21st-century has been more emotionally intimate than anything we’ve seen before – and no one bares more soul than Simon Amstell. Having started the millennium hosting trashy C4 show Popworld, a flit to standup recast this celebrity irritant as one of our most intense, and most fretful, comedians. His over-thinking, self-abasing work – minutely chronicling the emotional life of a gay, Jewish, vegan B-lister who questions everything – s live comedy, cinema and sitcom (BBC2’s Grandma’s House), and is always brilliantly alive. BLFor much of the millennium so far, British telly has been searching for its own Daily Show – a stringent, sassy topical comedy vehicle to help shape the nation’s political conversation. The closest it’s come has been The Mash Report, whose very own Jon Stewart is the standup Nish Kumar. A multiple Edinburgh Comedy award nominee, London boy Kumar is the smartest, and often the silliest, political comic we’ve got: acute, furious and often the ridiculous fall guy of his own jokes. BLNow that Jordan Peele is a full-blown Hollywood darling, it’s easy to forget where he came from. And that’s a remarkable shame, because he came from Key and Peele, a Comedy Central show that burnished the art of sketch comedy to a golden sheen. Almost every sketch it ever produced is a masterclass of the form perfect little nuggets of set-up, escalation and pay-off. Substitute Teacher, I Said Bitch, Turbulence, Outkast Reunion these are all on YouTube and will improve your afternoon a hundredfold. SHAs sketch comedy disappeared from TV screens, you could have been forgiven for thinking the artform was moribund. Far from it: the ex-Footlights trio Sheeps have twisted it into new shapes – most notably in 2014 show Wembley Previews, which featured one sketch, repeated in a dizzying array of styles. As if that weren’t enough, one-third of the team, the morose Yorkshireman Liam Williams, launched a voice-of-his-generation solo career, which blazed across the standup stage and brought us the hit BBC4 YouTube spoof Pls Like, and People Time, made with peers Claudia O’Doherty, Jamie and Natasia Demetriou and Ellie White. BLCult comics Tim and Eric nailed the nightmarishness of American excess way before Trump-induced anxiety spread across world. Dragging a Gen X cynicism into the present day, their creations reflect the incessant yammering of advertising, reality TV surrealism and the onslaught of online images and information. Some of their humour has no deep meaning, either: the greasy-haired spook Spagett, waxy entertainer Casey Tatum, and heartbreak horror of Carol and Mr Henderson. From their Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! series to web shorts such as Tim’s Kitchen Tips, their layered, abstract nihilism basically invented meme culture. HGYes, comedy has to be funny – but it can be mind-expanding, too, and never more so than in the work of Sara Pascoe. Even before her bestselling book about the female body, Animal, the Essex-born comic wore her erudition – and anthropological way of seeing the world – on her sleeve. The result was a series of cracking standup shows applying Pascoe’s loveably nervy intelligence to pair bonding, Nietzschean philosophy, “sperm selection” – all the big questions, in other words, and never a hack gag in sight. BLTwenty years back, few had mime and clowning pegged as the hippest strands of 21st-century comedy. No one’s played a greater role in their revival than Phil Burgers – AKA sexy clown-comic Dr Brown. A graduate – like so many of the saucer-eyed acts who followed – of Ecole Philippe Gaulier in Paris, Burgers developed an instant cult following with his silent, late-night shows: beautiful, skilful and playful, but also terrifying, in that Burgers displayed zero inhibitions and required his audiences to leave theirs at the door. An Edinburgh Comedy award followed Burgers’ influence is still being felt on live comedy. BLA man with such comic gift he can make an HSBC advert watchable. Ayoade’s dry-as-a-bone humour may be an acquired taste, but it hasn’t stopped him piecing together a career of unusual breadth: as host of gadget and travel shows, a deft movie director, the droll voice of sanity in panel shows, author of two impeccably written books, and, perhaps most inspired of all, presenter of The Crystal Maze. His most straightforwardly comic role to date is as Moss the uber-geeky IT technician in The IT Crowd. The appearance of Ayoade in any show is a seal of quality. PFBridges was already marked out as a standup wunderkind before his brilliant debut show in 2009 aged 23. He’s barely put a foot wrong since, and now rivals Michael McIntyre as Britain’s finest exponent of that much-maligned form, observational comedy. What Bridges brings to it is a punchiness that never tips over into aggression, and an intelligence that steers him away from cheap shots and dumbed-down material. And best of all, he’s a rare example of a mass-appeal standup who has the courage to be openly political, and the charm for it not to be isive. PFYou wouldn’t want to be Amy Schumer. She releases a standup set (The Leather Special) and has to defend herself against rightwing trolls determined to reduce its Netflix rating. She releases a movie (I Feel Pretty) and has to defend herself against leftwing trolls who form a consensus about its message based purely on its trailer. This weight of expectation would crush most people, but not Schumer. This is probably because she is very, very funny. Watch Trainwreck, or Mostly Sex Stuff, or any episode of Inside Amy Schumer for proof. We’re lucky to have her. SHPut aside, if you can, his tabloid ubiquity and ropey oeuvre of Hollywood films. Turn a blind eye to his questionable role in the 2015 general election. Brand the cultural phenomenon isn’t always a laughing matter, but Brand the comedian is harder to resist. On stage, where he can control how the narcissism, verbosity and new age philosophy come across – and where they’re spliced with wit, self-mockery and a palpable love of people and life – Brand is a presence to conjure with, one of our most unique and charismatic comic talents. BLAnsari has had a career of two halves. First, he was the playful standup whose routines revolved around clashing cultures and botched romances, a style translated into Netflix’s Master of None. When allegations of sexual assault were made in 2018, it seemed his career might be over for good. He has denied claims, no charges were pressed, but Ansari is now tackling the subject in his work a review described his new tour as “a cry against extreme wokeness”. Whether he can regain his former success remains to be seen, but he’s determined to use comedy to make a statement. HJDWhen Daniel Kitson won the 2002 Perrier award, breakout success seemed just a matter of time. But that’s not what Kitson wanted. The Yorkshireman has since constructed the most respected bespoke career in comedy. He doesn’t do telly, panel shows or media – yet his gigs (sometimes standup, sometimes plays, sometimes solo storytelling) often sell out far in advance. And his voice is among the most distinctive in comedy: barbed but romantic, blunt but lyrical, fiercely protective of humanity’s fragile flame as the chill winds of soulless modernity billow around it. BLWhen he was team captain on Mock the Week and best known for comparing a swimmer to a spoon, few would have nominated Frankie Boyle as one of the comics of the century. But that was before the Glaswegian’s transformation into the most lacerating comic-critic of Tory Britain. On stage, in his newspaper columns, and on his terrific BBC show New World Order, Boyle has retained the brutality and joke-writing brilliance of his early work, but applied it to sociopolitics over celebrity. Boyle 2.0 is the appalling, apocalyptic comic-poet our end-of-days era demands. BLMost assumed that The Daily Show would end when Jon Stewart quit in 2015. To all intents and purposes, the show was Stewart intelligent, probing, angry and humane. So what do you do when you have to replace the voice of a generation? Easy, you find another one. Enter Trevor Noah. He’s younger than Stewart, and much slicker, but his Daily Show has finally found its voice. Noah is such an outsider – not only a foreigner, but a South African born to interracial parents at the height of apartheid – that his point of view can’t help but stand out against those of the white male Jimmys that make up the rest of late night TV. SHWhen he played the O2 in London in 2013, on the back of the cult success of his autobiographical sitcom Louie, Louis CK was greeted as the world’s best standup: a philosopher with great jokes, and a pitiless chronicler of the foibles of the midlife male. Then in 2017, several female comics alleged he had sexually harassed them. CK confessed, and withdrew from comedy – but not for long enough, say critics of his recent comeback. No one denies he delivered some brilliant standup in his pomp – but all those cynical gags about predatory maleness no longer sound quite so funny. BLDespite reaching their anarchic zenith in the 90s, the pair segued into the 00s with hits such as Shooting Stars (which ran until 2011), lost classics such as Catterick and Vic and Bob’s Afternoon Delights, as well as sitcoms (House of Fools) and reboots (Big Night Out). They’ve also prospered independently and in the most surprising places – Bob’s able to turn a panel show such as Would I Lie to You? into an odd Audience With performance. Between them they’ve survived a triple heart bypass and a visit to the I’m a Celebrity Jungle, to remain the reigning champions of surreal comedy. HGGadsby’s 2017 show, Nanette, was supposed to be her last before quitting comedy. An attack on homophobia and sexual violence, and an outpouring of pain and anger, Gadsby – a dry, modest comic from Tasmania – also turns her fire on standup itself, for giving the illusion of helping her mental health. Nanette was so bold, timely and devastatingly well written, that it’s taken on a life of its own. A Netflix special was a huge hit, and she has, thank goodness, reversed her decision to quit the business. PFFrom Ali G to Borat to Brüno, Sacha Baron Cohen’s audacious trolling and timely satire has made him one of comedy’s best-known provocateurs. His style might not feel as edgy as it once was, and there have been some blips along the way (see 2012 film The Dictator). However, when he gets it right he can still make a huge impact, with latest series Who Is America? highlighting the ludicrousness of US politics. HJDThe sadcom is the subgenre that takes the darker elements of the human condition – the ones previously reserved for standup – and fuses them with the tenets of TV comedy. Arguably, no comic has nailed this auteur trend better than Notaro, whose Amazon show One Mississippi focused on an annus horribilis that included the death of her mother, her cancer diagnosis and a breakup. In the wake of its (unpopular) cancellation, she brought her mix of deadpan and emotion to a Netflix special, Happy to Be Here, sealing her reputation as a pioneer of “traumedy”. HJDUS comic Rae harnessed the power of the webseries in the early 2010s, with her YouTube comedy The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl landing her a place on Forbes’ 30 Under 30 Entertainment List in 2012. While an early project with Shonda Rhimes was canned, Rae’s star rose via her HBO series, Insecure. In a world still bound to tired stereotypes of alternately fierce and subjugated black women, this pop culture-heavy comedy stood out, as did the voice behind it, who plays the lead role with an understated confidence and, of course, lashings of awkwardness. HJDThe criticism commonly levelled at mid-career Ricky Gervais (the arena standup the outre awards host the man who made and played Derek) is that he’s turned into – or perhaps always was – his Office alter ego David Brent, forever tittering at how provocative he can be. Which at least goes to show what an unforgettable comic monster Brent was in the first place, a middle-management pipsqueak with delusions of charisma, fronting a pioneering cringe comedy and still-brilliant mockumentary nailing the pettiness and desolation of workplace life. BLNo one with half a brain ever doubted that female could be funny. But feminism? Even Bridget Christie fought shy of the subject early in her career, when she stepped out as a daft sub-surrealist in disguise as Charles II. Or an ant. But then came A Bic for Her, her breakout 2013 set, a fantastically daft – yet fiercely committed – cri de coeur against everywhere sexism. Alongside the book, and the radio show, Christie has gone on to enjoy a brilliant career in campaigning comedy, and not only for feminist causes – sometimes it seems that there’s nothing this terrific clown can’t make funny. BLRanganathan was on the brink of quitting comedy when he won the Leicester Mercury comedian of the year contest in 2013. Since then, the former maths teacher has done everything from presenting a travelogue with his mum (BBC3’s Asian Provocateur) to making a sitcom based on the real-life story of inheriting his dad’s pub (The Reluctant Landlord) to presenting a hip-hop podcast, as well as being a Mock the Week fixture. While he has stated that he doesn’t do “Asian comedy … I’m just an Asian man who happens to be doing comedy”, race features within a self-deprecating, off-kilter style. HJDTo call someone “random” may be slanderous in 2019, but when the Boosh arrived in the mid 00s with their hermaphroditic mermen, talking gorillas and giant lumps of evil bubblegum it was an illuminating antidote to the bleak mockumentary realism of the comedy that was booming at the time. Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt’s Boosh radio series introduced listeners to the zooniverse of strange wonders, but their 2004 TV show was totally transportive: from its art school aesthetic to its dreamlike characters, it was as visually stimulating as a Jim Henson creation, or like stepping into a Frank Zappa album. HGHis reputation has been damaged lately by some unpleasant material on gender – even if the 2017 Netflix specials in question went on to be the channel’s most watched comedy specials of all time. But for years, you’d have struggled to find a more authoritative standup worldwide than Dave Chappelle. Live performance aside, he entered the big league with Chappelle’s Show, the trailblazing sketch series that made a whole new kind of merry with race, politics and pop culture. Its status – and Chappelle’s no-compromise reputation – was secured when the star mysteriously quit the programme mid-recording in 2006, triggering a seven-year sabbatical from showbiz. BLTo watch a Maria Bamford standup set is to sprint full-pelt to keep up with her train of thought. Other comedians might take the time to state and reinforce a premise before launching into their punchlines, but not Bamford. Her sets are a free-associated cavalcade of broken logic and weird voices, and it often takes full concentration just to figure out what’s going on. Watch 2012’s The Special Special Special! if you haven’t already. It’s Bamford performing standup for just her parents, and it is glorious. SHPolitical views can kill a comedian’s mojo (hello, Eddie Izzard). So what will happen to Sarah Silverman? Her early standup persona was a sort of narcissistic brat with no boundaries. Then she got politicised. Silverman’s reaction to the rise of Donald Trump has been not just liberal rage, but attempts to reach out to his voters and understand them. Will this new-found earnestness kill her comedy mojo? It appears not. Her latest Netflix special, A Speck of Dust, shows she can inveigle her politics into her standup without compromising either. She’s a remarkably gifted comic, with incredible control and courage – that she is still evolving makes her all the better. PFFormer SNL cast member Amy Poehler got her big break as Pawnee’s most enthusiastic public servant on Parks and Recreation. Poehler’s hyperbolically feminist Leslie Knope pokes fun at lean-in culture, while also cementing the actor’s reputation as a master of weirdo characters. It’s a trend she continued as a mentor for Broad City’s Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, helping to bring their show to TV and acting as its exec producer. HJDMost SNL performers simply slope off when their time is up, but not Kristen Wiig. Her final episode, after seven years on the show, ended with a Lorne Michaels slow-dance as Mick Jagger sang Ruby Tuesday to her. By that point, of course, she’d already written and starred in Bridesmaids – a hit so colossal that it tends to overshadow her other work. Stick a pin anywhere in her filmography, though, and you’ll strike gold. Plus she’s playing the baddie in Wonder Woman 1984, which is likely to vault her into the stratosphere. SHHorgan has gone from portraying young drinking, shagging women (Pulling), to dysfunctional grown-up relationships (Catastrophe) to motherhood (Motherland) – and has nailed them all. Each show has been wickedly warts-and-all with almost documentary realism. Catastrophe remains the pick of the bunch, managing to be both funny and touching, and in Sharon and Rob she has created a comedy couple that will endure. PFThe first half of this decade saw an extraordinary flowering of creative live comedy centred around north-London production house The Invisible Dot. Jonny Sweet, Claudia O’Doherty and the stars of the Inbetweeners all made work here – but the flagship act was poet and performance-art comic Tim Key. Every Key show was an event, designed to upend – and expand – expectations of live comedy, and seduce us all with Key’s coy and slippery humour. A role as Alan Partridge’s sidekick gained Key wider recognition, but the live work is his indelible signature. BLEven during the six-year stretch when Curb Your Enthusiasm was off air, Larry David was funnier than anyone else. His Broadway play Fish in the Dark won rave reviews and millions of dollars in advance sales. His TV movie Clear History was much better than it should have been. And, in 2001, he wrote the world’s best op-ed on baldness. “If a hair guy has a girlfriend, he’s never threatened by a bald man. He doesn’t mind if his girlfriend has a platonic bald man in her life. ‘Come on in, bald man, make yourself at home.’” SHImagine how rubbish life would be without Julia Davis. Imagine how much happier the world would be. Everything Davis has written has been soaked in the worst excesses of human misery, but with a worrying degree of relatability, showing up the vulnerabilities of all of us. Human Remains was full of delusion. Nighty Night was a study of sociopathy. Hunderby exposed the dark guts of our period drama fetishisation. Camping felt like being drugged unconscious and dragged into the forest by woodspeople (or a clingy boyfriend). Her latest, Sally4Ever, is possibly her darkest yet. Even in the quaint format of the podcast – Dear Joan and Jericha – she manages malevolence. Inexplicably, she has not created a dud in her career. A spectacular achievement. SHHaving come up through standup and recurring sitcom spots, Haddish hit the mainstream with a breakout role as wisecracking Dina in the 2017 film Girls Trip, a comedy that put the spotlight on black US sisterhood. Haddish has since gone on to be the first black female performer on Saturday Night Live, and written a book, The Last Black Unicorn, about her difficult childhood and taking up comedy as an alternative to therapy. HJDNo comedy career this century has been as remarkable as that of Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement, low-key Kiwi musical comics turned accidental global superstars. But if the scale has changed – from a dank cave on the Edinburgh fringe, via BBC radio, to breakout HBO sitcom success and award-hogging movie careers – the quality of the duo’s musicianship, wonderfully unexpected lyrics, and their deathless deadpan banter has remained hilariously sky-high. Business Time, The Humans Are Dead, Carol Brown – their comic songs are among the finest ever written. BLChris Rock was already a star at the turn of the millennium but the 21st century turned him into a megastar. His first two standup specials since 2000, Never Scared and Kill the Messenger, are full of trademark Rock fury but the third, last year’s Tamborine, is quieter and more humane. Plus in this time he made Everybody Hates Chris, Top Five and The Motherfucker With the Hat. That Chris Rock is one of the funniest people alive goes without saying. The scary thing is that, after 30 years in the business, he might actually be getting better. SHYes, there is Alan Partridge – a character of such magnitude that lesser comedians would have given up at that. But in addition, Steve Coogan has starred in three series of The Trip, seamlessly blending travelogue, impression show and gloomy indie drama into a brave new form all of its own. His film work has lurched from critically celebrated highbrow comedy (24 Hour Party People, A Cock and Bull Story) to hugely underrated would-be blockbusters (Hamlet 2, Around the World in 80 Days). And he’s Alan bloody Partridge, for crying out loud. Surely that’s enough by itself. SHTina Fey is having quite the busy century. In 1999 she became Saturday Night Live’s first female head writer, winning the show its first best writing Emmy for 13 years in the process. In 2004 she wrote Mean Girls. From 2006 to 2013 she wrote and starred in 30 Rock, winning 112 Emmy nominations along the way. In 2011 she was paid $6m to write Bossypants, opening the floodgates for dozens of essay collections by female comedians. She co-created Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. She executive-produced Great News, one of the best lost sitcoms of our age. She has rapped with Childish Gambino. She performs the definitive Sarah Palin impersonation. She is one of the very few non-obnoxious people ever to host the Golden Globes. And she isn’t slowing down, either her new NBC sitcom – in which Ted Danson will play an obnoxious mayor of Los Angeles – sounds like it’s going to be a slam-dunk, and she’ll soon star in what’s likely to be the most successful film of her life in Pixar’s Soul. She remains precisely as exacting, hilarious and influential as she’s ever been. Remove any of her projects from your life, with the possible exception of Wine Country, and the world immediately becomes a much worse place. A true legend.

That’s the aim of the latest Fairphone 3 – and on many counts it succeeds.Ethically creating a phone is a lot harder than it may sound, but you have to start somewhere. Amsterdam-based Fairphone turned from an awareness campaign about conflict minerals into a phone company in 2013, and aims to source as many materials as possible in both human and environmentally kind ways.Now in its third iteration, the £420 Fairphone 3 is making progress, not only in responsible sourcing of materials, but in manufacturing and longevity, with a modular, repairable design. It even comes with its own screwdriver.There’s no two ways about it: the Fairphone 3 has a dated design. Big chunks of body at the top and bottom of the screen are reminiscent of smartphones from five years ago. The LCD display is fairly small by today’s standards at 5.7in, but is reasonable with pretty good colours and excellent viewing angles, and is just about bright enough – most of the time you’ll see the brightness cranked up to maximum. It’s covered by Gorilla Glass 5, which isn’t the latest, but at least should make it fairly scratch-resistant.The rest of the body is utilitarian and boxy. At almost 1cm thick, the Fairphone 3 is certainly a chunky beast. The big chin and forehead, as well as fairly thick bezels each side of the screen, make the phone a lot larger than its small screen dimensions might suggest too. It’s closer in size to a phone with a screen over 6.4in, and so requires similar hand-stretching to use it.The translucent black plastic body feels well made and hard-wearing. Being able to see the usually hidden components through the plastic makes it all the more interesting. There’s very little flex or give anywhere on the phone, which is all the more impressive give you can take the back off and remove modules.The volume buttons and power button are all on the left side of the phone, which took some getting used to. The speaker, too, is mounted in the left side of the phone, which means you’re more likely to block it with an errant finger.Through the back of the phone you can see the phrase “Change is in your hands” written on the battery, which is a little bit self-congratulatory for my tastes.A USB-C socket in the bottom handles charging, while there is a (now rare) headphone socket in the top. There’s also a fingerprint scanner on the back, which works fairly well but is a bit high up the back to be easily reachable without moving the phone down your hand a little each time you need to touch it.The Fairphone 3 won’t win any prizes for performance. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 632 chip from last year, which is a lower-performance mid-range processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus a microSD card slot for adding more.General performance isn’t terrible, but it certainly isn’t fast, even compared with mid-range smartphones costing less. There are elements of lag and stutter all over the system. You quickly run into slowdown when simply trying to find your way to a meeting, as launching the calendar app to find an address, then Google Maps and Citymapper to compare directions was enough to repeatedly introduce significant lag. Press a button and nothing happens long enough to make you question whether you managed to actually activate the button.Battery life is equally middle of the road at about 26 hours between charges, meaning it lasts from 7am on day one until 9am on day two. That is while using the Fairphone 3 as my primary device with a total screen time of just over four hours, lots of email and messages, browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of offline Amazon Prime Video and a few photos.The Fairphone 3 doesn’t ship with a charger or cable. It charges in about 2 hours 10 minutes using a standard 30W USB-C charger, or faster using one that supports Qualcomm’s QuickCharge 3 (€19.95 from Fairphone). But there’s also the possibility of just swapping in another charged battery, given you can remove it in less than five seconds.The Fairphone 3 ships with its own Fairphone OS, which is a standard version of Android, free of bloat or duplicated apps and all the better for it. The only minor disappointment is that it ships on Android 9, not the new Android 10, although Fairphone aims to provide security and software updates for five years from release.Anyone who has used Android in the last five years will be familiar with it, while switching to it from an iPhone is fairly straightforward. It’s clear that Fairphone needs to do a better job at optimising the performance of the software, however, as the issues of lag are likely to be avoidable with a bit of work.The Fairphone 3 has a fairly standard 12-megapixel camera on the back, which is technically the same as that fitted to Google’s Pixel 3a, but doesn’t come anywhere close, lacking the software magic that makes Google’s camera so good.In good lighting the Fairphone 3 shoots reasonable pictures with a solid amount of detail and colour. The same goes for selfies and portraits. Unfortunately that’s not the case in middling to low light conditions. Shots taken indoors at night with a mixture of overhead and lamp lighting produced dark, grainy and indistinct images.Overall, the Fairphone 3’s camera performance is similar to today’s budget phones: fine on a sunny day, but poor indoors.Other than efforts from the company to source materials ethically, and to pay the factory workers who put together the phone a top-up to a living wage, the most exciting thing about the Fairphone 3 is its modular nature. It’s not some Google Ara reinvention of the wheel, but rather the ability to take out and replace or repair parts when they go wrong.Starting from the removable back and battery, the rest of the phone can be pulled apart with standard screws. Fairphone even includes the correct screwdriver in the box. If a part breaks, buy a replacement module, screw it in place and away you go. That’s the idea, anyway, and repair guide masters iFixit gave it a big thumbs up recently.The inidual parts aren’t that cheap, of course, but given you can place them yourself without breaking everything else in the process it seems like a fair trade-off. A replacement camera costs €49.95, the speaker €19.95, the bottom module with the USB-C socket in it costs €19.95 and the top module with the selfie camera, headphone socket and other bits costs €29.95. Probably more widely used parts are the screen for €89.95, the battery for €29.95 or the back cover for €24.95.The Fairphone 3 is a device full of compromises with one massive advantage: being ethical.The design is a bit more interesting thanks to its translucent finish, but it’s chunky and dated-looking. The 5.7in screen is pretty good, but the big chin and bezels make the phone considerably larger and harder to use than it could be. It has USB-C and a headphone socket, both of which are welcome, but the odd speaker placement makes it easy to block.The inside is the same. The clean, bloat-free Android software is good, but it’s only Android 9 not the new Android 10, and it has performance issues. Dual-sim and microSD card support is great too, but Bluetooth performance was pretty poor.If you were to look at the Fairphone 3 simply as a £420 smartphone, you’d say it costs about £200 too much and isn’t even a great £220 phone at that. You can buy a phone with more modern design, similar specifications, performance and software for around £220 such as the Motorola Moto G7, or phones that are infinitely better at £420.But the Fairphone 3 isn’t just another smartphone: it’s an entirely different way of thinking about how a phone and its creation fits into the world.You can genuinely repair this phone yourself with modular components you simply unscrew and replace. If the battery is worn out, swap it out for a new one in less than 10 seconds. The Fairphone 3 is arguably the most sustainable phone you can buy, and that’s without even looking at the firm’s efforts to source all materials and manufacture the phone in as ethical manner as possible.But I worry that a phone that has performance issues now won’t be serviceable in five years, and so all the reparability in the world won’t make it a device people still want to use in 2024. If buyers use the Fairphone 3 for two years, then dump it for a new one, that defeats the object of the exercise.Until now it’s not been possible to put a real price on the ethical side of a smartphone in the same way you can with a Fairtrade chocolate bar. Thanks to the Fairphone 3, we now know it’s about £200. So the question is whether people are prepared to pay £200 extra to support a worthy movement. I hope they are.Pros: ethical manufacturing, sustainable materials, truly repairable, solidly built, dual-sim, microSD card slot, headphones socket, removable battery, bloat-free, software support for five yearsCons: only Android 9, middling performance, chunky, expensive for the specs, average camera, poor Bluetooth This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

But the muddy results that trickled in on Wednesday appeared to deadlock the country instead.Both leaders have vowed to lead Israel’s next government, but would need to form unlikely alliances with smaller parties to do so.Netanyahu wants to extend his record-breaking stretch as prime minister by forging pacts with religious politicians and far-right ultra-nationalists.The 69-year-old is not only fighting for his political life but also potentially his freedom, with pre-trial hearings for three corruption cases against him opening in just two weeks. A majority in the 120-seat parliament could help grant him immunity from prosecution.Speaking on Wednesday evening, Netanyahu insisted his party and its rightwing allies had chosen him to remain leader, even as it was unclear how he would form a government. “We decided unanimously that we’re going forward together to negotiations that will establish a government led by me,” he said.Late on Wednesday, he cancelled a trip to the UN general assembly next week, in order to deal with the political crisis at home.Gantz, a former general, has looked to centre and leftwing parties. But even those deals fall short of a parliamentary majority of 61 seats.In the middle stands Israel’s seeming kingmaker and staunch secularist, Avigdor Lieberman, who has called for a secular unity government of Likud, Blue and White, and his own party, the rightwing nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home).“The conclusion is clear,” he said outside his home in the occupied West Bank settlement of Nokdim on Wednesday. “There is one and only option: a national unity government that is broad and liberal and we will not join any other option.”Later, he said that if Netanyahu and Gantz were not interested in the proposal, “they should not make the effort to call me, for us there is no other option”.Lieberman’s plan was to exclude religious parties, but the option could be blocked by Gantz who has ruled out sitting in government with Netanyahu. It is not clear which of them would serve as prime minister, or whether they would split the four-year term.Gantz has suggested instead that the ruling Likud party drop Netanyahu for someone else, and said that then he would consider a unity government. “We will act to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people,” he told cheering supporters at a post-election rally in Tel Aviv.That, however, would be a dramatic move for a party Netanyahu has kept in power for 10 consecutive years.“We will never accept people that dictate who our leader is,” Nir Barkat, the former mayor of Jerusalem who joined Likud, said in comments at Netanyahu’s election party headquarters on Wednesday.Politicians from an alliance of the country’s minority Arab population could also prove decisive, with a large turnout suggesting they may be the third largest party in the Knesset. Ayman Odeh, leader of the main Arab faction in parliament, has said he may back Gantz but even that would not give the opposition leader a majority.Netanyahu, too, faces an tough battle, and with corruption indictments looming, the stakes for him in this election were higher than at any point in his three-decade political career.In a 3.30am speech to his party in Tel Aviv, the sullen-looking prime minister spoke on stage in a hoarse voice, after spending the day rallying his supporters with a megaphone.“In the next few days, we will begin negotiations to form a strong, Zionist government and in order to avert a dangerous, anti-Zionist government,” he said, as crowds cheered: “Bibi, the king of Israel.”Once the vote is counted, party chiefs will recommend to the president who they plan to back as leader. The president then tasks that person with forming a government, giving them up to six weeks to do so.The exit polls suggested Gantz could be that person, especially if he can forge a deal with Israel’s Arab parties. Netanyahu, who has demonised Israel’s significant Palestinian Arab minority as a fifth column that endangers the country, decried that option as “inconceivable”.The Israeli PM is embroiled in four cases involving allegations of bribery and misconduct. He denies wrongdoing in every instance.Case 1000\u0026nbspis an investigation into gifts received on a regular basis by Netanyahu and his family from two wealthy businessmen, including cigars and pink champagne.Case 2000\u0026nbspis examining whether Netanyahu behaved improperly during a taped conversation with a newspaper publisher in which he appeared to try to negotiate more sympathetic coverage in return for lowering the circulation of a rival paper.Case 3000\u0026nbspis an inquiry into alleged kickbacks in a deal to buy German submarines. Netanyahu is not a suspect, but he was closely involved in the deal and the case has ensnared members of his inner circle.\u0026nbspCase 4000, the most serious,\u0026nbspinvolves allegations that Netanyahu offered incentives to the Israeli telecoms company Bezeq in exchange for positive stories in an online news website it owns, Walla.To win support from Israeli rightwingers and settlers, both leaders have attempted to sell the promise of an expansionist Israel that extends its borders deep into Palestinian territory. Netanyahu vowed last week to declare up to a third of the occupied West Bank as part of Israel if he was re-elected and Gantz swiftly accused his political opponent of stealing his idea.President Reuven Rivlin said he would do everything in his power to avoid another election campaign, but a third election in January remains an option if no leader can form a government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92aacf5dd65fbb4aa693a873f8c08eb284b50a36/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ee6ef930b17f568fc8cf4d63a4db1e3","title":"of lawyer in gangster case shocks the netherlands","story":"Derk Wiersum, 44, was gunned down in an Amsterdam street in broad daylightThe murder of a lawyer for a key witness in a major Dutch organised crime trial has sparked outrage and calls for a tougher crackdown on violent underworld gangs.Derk Wiersum, a 44-year-old father of two, was gunned down in the street shortly after leaving his house in Amsterdam. Police are hunting a hoodie-wearing assailant who fled on foot.Wiersum was the lawyer for a state witness named Nabil B in a case against two Moroccan-born men dubbed the most wanted criminals in the Netherlands.The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said the killing in broad daylight in the capital was “incredibly disturbing” and that police were “on top” of the situation.“This is very alarming news. The police and the public prosecutor are investigating,” Rutte told reporters.The two suspects, Ridouan Taghi and Said Razzouki, are the subject of international arrest warrants for murder and drug trafficking.The lawyer’s murder came a year after Nabil B’s own brother was shot dead, raising questions about why Wiersum was not provided with better security.The justice and security minister, Ferd Grapperhaus, said he has set up a team of police and prosecutors led by the country’s counter-terrorism coordinator to intensify security around people working in the legal system.“This is an attack on our constitutional state,” Grapperhaus told reporters in The Hague, adding: “Organised crime has crossed a line.”One of Wiersum’s two children was at home at the time of the shooting, De Telegraaf newspaper said. Police covered his body with a white sheet while forensics teams investigated the site.“This is unprecedented,” Peter de Vries, one of the Netherlands’ best known crime reporters, told BNR news radio.Amsterdam has long been known for its tolerant attitude towards marijuana, but a report commissioned by the city council earlier this month said it now had a major problem with drugs.The report, titled The Other Side of Amsterdam, said that “drug-related organised crime - the ’underworld’ - exerts a significant influence on our city.”One of the main Dutch police unions said the shooting showed the situation in the Netherlands was getting out of control.“This is a confirmation that we live in a narco-state”, said Jan Struijs of the NPB police union. “It is an attack on the rule of law.”In 2018 the union made a similar warning, saying that the government and politicians underestimated the scale of crime, corruption, threats and money-laundering in the country.Meanwhile, a man died of his wounds after gunmen on a scooter fired shots at his car on Wednesday evening. Police believe it was an unrelated incident.Police said they were looking for two suspects wearing black and riding on a black three-wheeler scooter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885f2d0042afa8c0acd232bbb7d5251fc1a065b5/268_650_3156_1894/master/3156.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbde67cf7f4dbf0d2e68d3d06aa07ea","title":"jacinda ardern mistakes japan for china during tokyo visit","story":"New Zealand PM blames jet lag after hailing ‘relationship with China – excuse me sorry, with Japan’New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern has blamed jetlag for an embarrassing gaffe on her first official visit to Japan.Ardern had only just touched down in the country and was giving an interview when she said in her opening remarks it was an “incredibly exciting time for New Zealand in its relationship with China – excuse me sorry, with Japan”.When asked later about the blunder, Ardern put the mistake down to jet lag, having only just arrived from New Zealand, reported TVNZ. “You’ll understand I’ve been on continuous travel and just this moment I stopped here,” Ardern said.Japan is three hours behind New Zealand and a direct flight between the two countries takes 11 hours.The timing was unfortunate for Ardern. A report released on Thursday by the Asia New Zealand Foundation questioned whether New Zealand had allowed its relationship with Japan to “drift”, with more attention now being paid to China.“Perhaps we have taken the relationship with Japan a little bit for granted,” said the foundation’s executive director Simon Draper. Japan is New Zealand’s fourth-largest trading partner and worth NZ$8.8bn (£4.45bn) per year.Ardern is in Japan to discuss trade and tourism with the prime minister Shinzo Abe. She will also watch an All Blacks game at the Rugby World Cup.Ardern is on the first leg of an overseas trip that will next take her to the UN leaders general assembly meeting in New York, where she will give the keynote speech at the climate action summit.While in New York, Ardern will hold her first ever formal meeting with Donald Trump and given the pair’s chequered history she will no doubt be keen to avoid any further diplomatic muddles.In November 2017, one month after Ardern took office, Trump allegedly mistook her for the wife of Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau at the east Asia summit in Vietnam.Ardern later apologised for indiscreetly discussing the incident with a friend. The friend – comedian Tom Sainsbury – revealed in a radio interview that Ardern had told her Trump was “not as orange in real life”.

But he also told the Dáil the Government would use the provisions of the Belfast Agreement to seek a role in Northern Ireland in such a situation.“However, if the sovereign British government were to impose it, we would seek a consultative role under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But he also told the Dáil this afternoon that the Government will use the provisions of the Belfast Agreement to seek a role in Northern Ireland in such a situation.“On direct rule, the imposition of direct rule by Westminster on Northern Ireland is not something that the Government can support. We believe it would be contrary to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and, in particular, the St. Andrews Agreement,” Mr Varadkar said.“However, if the sovereign British government were to impose it, we would seek a consultative role under the auspices of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement.”Further meetingMr Varadkar said that he had told the British prime minister Boris Johnson of his intentions when the two men met in Dublin last week.Mr Varadkar also said that his officials were trying to arrange a further meeting with Mr Johnson on the fringes of the UN general assembly which takes place in New York next week, and which both men will be attending.He also said that Mr Johnson had expressed a desire to attend the next British-Irish Council meeting, which takes place in Dublin in November.“I expressed the view that it would be a positive statement for him to do so because, generally, it has not been the practice of British Prime Ministers to attend they have usually been represented by the Deputy prime minister. It would be a positive statement for the Prime Minister to attend if he is able to do so,” Mr Varadkar said.The Taoiseach also said that a no-deal Brexit would make it “very difficult” to restore the Stormont assembly and the power-sharing administration.“In terms of the prospects for restoring the Executive and the Assembly, much of that hangs on Brexit,” he said.If we are able to secure a deal we would be in a good position to do so.

Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsFor a while on Wednesday, continuing discussion about the dire circumstances of protesting beef farmers gave way to brief consideration of the suffering caused by vulture farmers.These are the faceless investment companies dedicated to herding tenants from their homes so they can turn a handsome profit from the valuable real estate they leave behind.“Ruthless, inhuman vulture funds,” as Richard Boyd Barrett of People Before Profit described them during Leaders’ Questions.He drew the Taoiseach’s attention to the public gallery, packed with people representing tenants from property blocks in three different parts of Dublin. They face eviction by commercial entities which “have absolutely no concern for the welfare of those tenants but seek to evict them in order to drive up the value of the property assets they have purchased”.Leo Varadkar might have preferred not to look up and catch the gaze of any of the human liabilities who have to be managed from their homes before the all-important managing of the assets can begin.But they were definitely looking down at him. With a fierce intensity.Boyd Barrett, working the gallery as he upped the decibels and gesticulated angrily at Varadkar, said these vulture funds are exploiting loopholes in residential tenancies legislation to attempt and, in many cases, achieve evictions. The law is there for landlords who want to sell or substantially do up their properties.Greedy clawsBut was it really intended to help major domestic and international investment companies sink their greedy claws into communities?The TD for Dún Laoghaire pointed the Taoiseach in the direction of the group from his own constituency, good, paying tenants who are now resisting a fourth attempt in two years, involving two different firms, to move them out.But you wouldn’t be up to the guile of these heartless vultures and their determination to have their way and take their profits.It seems these human liabilities are now being turfed out by the asset managers in instalments.This is their way of getting around the “Tyrellstown amendment” which was passed two years ago to stop mass evictions after residents of a scheme in west Dublin were simultaneously served with termination notices by a landlord who wanted to sell the entire development with vacant possession.The law restricts evictions if more than 10 tenants are involved.“So what do these vulture funds do?” Boyd Barrett wondered aloud. “They evict eight of the 11 tenants and then, in nine months’ time, they can evict the other three.”Slowly, the vulture farmers cultivating the asset whittle down numbers “through insecurity, fear and anxiety”.In the Dún Laoghaire complex, 10 of the 21 tenants have already thrown in the towel. People from the other apartments and terraces mentioned in the Dáil are in the same boat.Safe spaceWhen real people with real problems visit the chamber it’s always a little awkward for Government TDs because they have to share their safe space with people who are genuinely angry or distressed and at their wits’ end and looking to them for help.Wednesday’s intake went outside the gates later and held a protest on Kildare Street, but, in such a situation, TDs can always stay indoors or put their heads down and scuttle briskly past.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, seated next to the Taoiseach, hastily wrote a few notes on a piece of paper and slid it in front of his boss.Boyd Barrett had bearded him earlier about the situation during ministerial questions. He asked him what he intended to do to stop “these ruthless, inhuman vulture funds – because that is what they are”.These funds exist to make profits. “They don’t want to be landlords, they don’t care about the tenants, they don’t care about the kids they just want to drive up the value of the asset.”Now he was putting the same question to the Taoiseach.He jabbed a finger at Leo.“What are you going to do about it?”He said the Dáil passed People Before Profit’s anti-evictions Bill but the Government had done nothing about it. He thundered about former finance minister Michael Noonan “inviting” in the vulture funds in 2013 and holding a series of meetings with them.“You have protected these vultures and given them tax breaks,” the TD roared, to approving nods in the gallery above.“What, Taoiseach, are you going to do?”‘Conflating evictions’Leo rose and began his reply by politely correcting the still-simmering Boyd-Barrett’s use of language.“I think you may be conflating evictions with notices to quit and, of course, they are not the same thing and it is wrong to conflate the two.”The deputy for Dún Laoghaire glowered.In contrast to Richard’s passion, Leo spoke quietly and kept his tone level.Eviction rates in Ireland are very low, he pointed out.The people in the gallery, used to eviction notices landing on their mats, didn’t appear too cheered by this factual nugget.The Taoiseach then outlined, in some length, the aspects of housing policy introduced by his Government to “strengthen and enhance the rights of tenants”.He mentioned rent controls, longer notice-to-quit periods and the requirement for landlords to offer the property to the tenant first after refurbishments have taken place. There is also an important role for the Residential Tenancies Board, which he understands is involved in a number of cases related to the situations raised in the chamber.But he steered clear of the loopholes.The reason, countered Boyd Barrett, for “the failure of all the stuff you’ve cited to address the threat of vulture funds trying to evict people”, is there for all to see in the Dún Laoghaire case: two different funds, one flipping to the other, and four attempts to get people out.“It has an attrition affect when they keep doing this . . . and they have succeeded.” Tenants have already bailed, leaving 10 units vacant.The council should slap a compulsory purchase order on the property.Close the loopholesAnd the Government should close the loopholes that continually allow vulture funds to throw out tenants.More approving nods and smiles in the public gallery.The Taoiseach reiterated the success of the rent caps before getting a little superior again with Boyd Barrett.“You mentioned landlords attempting to evict tenants . . . By attempting to evict I assume they were unsuccessful and that would indicate the law was on the side of the tenants and was therefore successful.”That went down like a lead balloon with the crowd in the visitor’s gallery.Boyd Barrett reminded Varadkar that 10 tenants had left their homes.But, as the Taoiseach earlier reminded the socialist politician and the people he brought to Leinster House, leaving in the face of notices to quit and neighbours moving out cannot be classed as an eviction.This will have come as a comfort to the stressed tenants. Because when it comes to peace of mind, they now know there is a big difference between evicting somebody and psyching them out of the place.No point in needlessly conflating, so might as well go home and stop worrying.Thanks to the Taoiseach, their trip to the Dáil wasn’t entirely in vain."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4022671.1568826278!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"much heat but little light in pursuit of brexit deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has been told by EU leaders proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty. Photograph: GettyOn Friday it will be 30 days since German chancellor Angela Merkel told Boris Johnson during a Berlin news conference that a solution to the Brexit impasse could maybe be found within 30 days.Johnson, seizing on her remarks, welcomed the “blistering timetable” and declared “Wir schaffen das” (“We will manage”) a “Yes we can!” type phrase previously used by Merkel about the refugee crisis.And off he went. On that swing through European capitals, Johnson seemed to impress Merkel and later French president Emmanuel Macron with his desire to agree a new deal with the EU. Last week, he did the same with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.But what Merkel and Macron, Varadkar and Jean Claude Juncker (don’t mention Xavier Bettel) and every other EU leader to whom he has spoken have said to Johnson is that those proposals must achieve the same effect as the backstop contained in the withdrawal treaty.But 29 days on, there has been no sign of British proposals which do anything of the sort. As EU leaders note with increasing irritation, nothing concrete has been tabled by the British government which could serve as a basis for negotiations with the EU.Neither have the British tabled workable solutions in the technical discussions that continue between Downing Street officials and the European Commission – meetings that Johnson now wants to intensify so that they take place every day. While Brussels sources wonder for what? A series of British ministers – most recently new Northern Secretary Julian Smith – have floated various ideas to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, as reported in Wednesday’s .But several senior Irish sources are clear as a whistle on these ideas and concepts: none of them go remotely far enough towards establishing a workable alternative to the backstop. In other words, not alone are there no negotiations on a new deal going on, we are quite a distance away from the starting point for such negotiations. Speculation as to whether Johnson is serious about wanting a deal comes and goes in Dublin and in Brussels. Some politicians and officials expect British proposals to replace the backstop to be tabled late in the day, with a frantic period of negotiating against the deadline of a no-deal Brexit looming. Others say this is all just part of a strategy to avoid the blame for no deal. What, if anything, is taking shape? Johnson has claimed the shape of a deal is becoming clearer. And despite protestations it appears that if there is to be a deal it will be a Northern Ireland-specific solution that involves treating the North differently from the rest of the UK, in some respects. There may be a role for Stormont to give it democratic legitimacy in Northern Ireland. It will include an all-Ireland food and agriculture zone (eliminating the requirement for animals to be checked on the Border) and a series of measures such as a trusted-trader scheme, checks on goods at a business level and other arrangements designed to reduce cross-Border friction.However, senior Irish sources familiar with Government deliberations say that even if the details of these measures were worked out – and they are not – they would be insufficient to replace the backstop.That is because the position of Theresa May’s government – that it would eliminate the need for a border – has been junked by Johnson and replaced with a commitment to try to make the Border as frictionless as possible. That is a very big difference. And it will make a deal very difficult to reach. The mood in Dublin is growing more pessimistic.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

These small objects literally changed the face of Britain.”Known as cosmetic grinders, the small mortar and pestle sets could be hung from a delicate cord, a feature which led to them being initially identified as decorative pendants.However, following closer examination of their delicate shape and size, Ms Moffett and her team now believe they were cosmetic sets developed in 1st Century AD Britain in response to notions of personal beauty imported from the Mediterranean and more distant Roman provinces. A curator shows off one of the make up objects found at Wroxeter and now thought to be make up applicatorsEnglish Heritage says their discovery casts new light on the daily habits of women in Roman Britain.Ms Moffett added: “When we think of the Roman period, conversation is often dominated by the masculine realms of influence, from Emperors and politics to battle tactics, but of course women played a key role. “It’s these functional, everyday items that really paint a picture of relatable women, to whom make-up was wholly accessible, following the trends of the time and using tools so similar to the ones we use today.“It was the  Romans who introduced this sort of makeup for women and it was widely adopted by the native female population. The habit continued until the fall of the Roman Empire when the spread of Christianity led to very different ideas about female modesty.”To accompany its reassessment of the objects, which are going on display for the first time at Wroxeter Roman City from Wednesday, English Heritage has released a tutorial on YouTube showing the techniques which would have been used by women in Roman Britain to apply make-up using the applicators.Taking inspiration from known images of the Empress Julia Domna, who with her husband Septimius Severus spent three years in York in 3rd century AD, the tutorial demonstrates how to apply eyeliner using a replica cosmetic grinder.The videos are presented by fashion historian Amber Butchart and makeup artist Rebecca Butterworth, who have previously recreate looks from history - including Elizabeth I at Kenilworth Castle in Warwickshire, Queen Victoria at Osborne on the Isle of Wight, and the Georgians at Kenwood House in London.Wroxeter, or Viriconium as it was called by the Romans, was once the fourth largest city in Roman Britain, with bath houses, markets and a thriving forum. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In reality, it offers one new feature that’s radically different and others that reveal how useful they are the more you get to know them.Apple announced its new smart timepiece, called Apple Watch Series 5, alongside the new iPhone 11 in Cupertino, California. It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow\u0026nbspentirely different.The design itself hasn’t changed from last year. That’s no surprise because 2018’s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.The Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.First, there’s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When you bet £25+ Monday to Saturday.Should the government step in to scrutinise deals like the Cobham takeover more often?\u0026nbspOur chief business commentator James Moore thinks so.\u0026nbspThere are so many bad things happening in Britain right now that the overseas takeover of yet another big British business, one that actually makes things and sells them overseas, seems barely to have been noticed, he writes.\u0026nbspAnother reason is perhaps that Cobham, an aerospace and defence business that has agreed to a £4bn bid from American buyout firm Advent International, is hardly a household name.\u0026nbspIt is perhaps best known as a pioneer of air to air refuelling tech, but it also supplies electronic and radar equipment to the civilian aerospace as well as the defence industry. Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspMinisters have stopped asking if business deals are good for BritainRecord numbers seek debt help\u0026nbspDebt charity StepChange says a record number of people - some 331,337 -\u0026nbspmade contact to seek help in the first half of the year.\u0026nbspOf all those who contacted the charity, 190,484 went on to receive full debt advice.\u0026nbspPhil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.\u0026nbsp“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.\u0026nbspFull story:\u0026nbspRecord numbers of people now seeking help with their debt, says charity\u0026nbspNot enough robots, say MPs\u0026nbsp“The problem for the UK labour market and our economy is not that we have too many robots in the workplace, but that we have too few,” say MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.\u0026nbspTheir report published today after months of research says the UK lags behind G7 competitors in adopting robots.\u0026nbspBusiness and Economics Editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspFuture of work: UK’s problem is not too many robots but too few, MPs sayBreaking: Inflation drops to 1.7 per cent in August - it\u0027s lowest since December 2016\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat\u0027s below economists expectations of 1.9 per cent and well within the Bank of England\u0027s target of 2 per cent.Ryanair and BA strikes latest\u0026nbspIn what is turning into an autumn of discontent for the travel industry, passengers are once again caught in the middle of another bitter dispute between an airline and its pilots, writes Travel Correspondent\u0026nbspSimon Calder.British Airways\u0026nbspis expected to cancel nearly 1,000 flights because of a strike by members of the\u0026nbspBritish Airline Pilots’ Association\u0026nbsp(Balpa) on 27 September.Before that, Balpa members employed by\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspin the UK are about to begin another seven days of\u0026nbspstrikes.\u0026nbspFind out the latest on whether your flight might be affected here:\u0026nbspRyanair strike: will my flight be affected?Food and drink prices rise\u0026nbspThe ONS explains:Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by more between July and August 2019 than between the same two months of 2018.\u0026nbspThe effects were relatively small from all categories within this heading, with the largest upward ones coming from bread and cereals (from products such as dried potted snacks, breakfast cereal and packs of inidual cakes), and meat (principally cooked ham).Pound falls after inflation data\u0026nbspThe pound is down 0.42\u0026nbspper cent against the dollar on the back of lower-than-expected-inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is at $1.245 and has dropped 0.27 per cent against the euro to €1.104.\u0026nbspPoorer areas hit hardest by disappearance of free-to-use cash machines\u0026nbspFree-to-use cash machines are vanishing more quickly in deprived areas than in affluent ones, according to consumer campaigners who are pressing Chancellor Sajid Javid to implement a cash guarantee.Which?

Within that grouping, games, toys and hobbies fell 5 per cent between July and August 2019.\u0026nbspAir fares rose by more in 2019 than in 2018 but sea fares rose by less.\u0026nbspA number of essential costs have also risen in price, including\u0026nbspthe cost of owning a home, energy bills, and council tax.\u0026nbspClothes and shoes rose in price by 1.8 per cent.Cash-starved Air India putting crews on low-fat diet\u0026nbspNEW DELHI (AP) Cash-starved Air India is putting its crew on a diet, changing their inflight menu to special low-fat meals.\u0026nbspDhananjay Kumar, the state-run airline\u0027s spokesman, said Wednesday that the objective is to provide healthy and cost-effective meals to crews on domestic and international flights.\u0026nbspKumar declined comment on media reports that the cost per meal, mostly vegetarian, will come down to one-third of existing 500-800 rupees (up to $11) per meal.\u0026nbspThe new menu was introduced Monday on flights originating from New Delhi and Mumbai and will be extended to other routes soon.\u0026nbspAssociated PressThe chancellor is, unsurprisingly, upbeat about the the latest inflation figures.\u0026nbspSajid Javid, said: “Low inflation and high wage growth means people\u0027s hard-earned cash is going further, helping them to provide for their families.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re helping with the cost of living by cutting taxes for more than 30 million people and ensuring that almost a million of our dedicated public sector workers - including our soldiers, teachers and doctors - get above-inflation pay increases.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was well above the 75 per cent approval required.The proposal had met with staunch opposition from Lady Nadine Cobham, whose late husband Michael ran the business.She had called for the government to step in and on Wednesday welcomed the move by Ms Leadsom: “I’m delighted that the government has listened to the widespread concerns about this takeover offer and the risk it poses to high-tech jobs and our national security.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

The promise has helped it win support from local residents in a region with one of the highest unemployment rates in the country.The project is already a vital source of jobs in the area, directly employing 1,200 people.A government spokesman said: “We cannot comment on commercially sensitive matters. All requests for financial support must meet necessary lending criteria.

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks chances in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

When you bet £25+ Monday to Saturday.Should the government step in to scrutinise deals like the Cobham takeover more often?\u0026nbspOur chief business commentator James Moore thinks so.\u0026nbspThere are so many bad things happening in Britain right now that the overseas takeover of yet another big British business, one that actually makes things and sells them overseas, seems barely to have been noticed, he writes.\u0026nbspAnother reason is perhaps that Cobham, an aerospace and defence business that has agreed to a £4bn bid from American buyout firm Advent International, is hardly a household name.\u0026nbspIt is perhaps best known as a pioneer of air to air refuelling tech, but it also supplies electronic and radar equipment to the civilian aerospace as well as the defence industry. Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspMinisters have stopped asking if business deals are good for BritainRecord numbers seek debt help\u0026nbspDebt charity StepChange says a record number of people - some 331,337 -\u0026nbspmade contact to seek help in the first half of the year.\u0026nbspOf all those who contacted the charity, 190,484 went on to receive full debt advice.\u0026nbspPhil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.\u0026nbsp“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.\u0026nbspFull story:\u0026nbspRecord numbers of people now seeking help with their debt, says charity\u0026nbspNot enough robots, say MPs\u0026nbsp“The problem for the UK labour market and our economy is not that we have too many robots in the workplace, but that we have too few,” say MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee.\u0026nbspTheir report published today after months of research says the UK lags behind G7 competitors in adopting robots.\u0026nbspBusiness and Economics Editor, Olesya Dmitracova:\u0026nbspFuture of work: UK’s problem is not too many robots but too few, MPs sayBreaking: Inflation drops to 1.7 per cent in August - it\u0027s lowest since December 2016\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThat\u0027s below economists expectations of 1.9 per cent and well within the Bank of England\u0027s target of 2 per cent.Ryanair and BA strikes latest\u0026nbspIn what is turning into an autumn of discontent for the travel industry, passengers are once again caught in the middle of another bitter dispute between an airline and its pilots, writes Travel Correspondent\u0026nbspSimon Calder.British Airways\u0026nbspis expected to cancel nearly 1,000 flights because of a strike by members of the\u0026nbspBritish Airline Pilots’ Association\u0026nbsp(Balpa) on 27 September.Before that, Balpa members employed by\u0026nbspRyanair\u0026nbspin the UK are about to begin another seven days of\u0026nbspstrikes.\u0026nbspFind out the latest on whether your flight might be affected here:\u0026nbspRyanair strike: will my flight be affected?Food and drink prices rise\u0026nbspThe ONS explains:Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose by more between July and August 2019 than between the same two months of 2018.\u0026nbspThe effects were relatively small from all categories within this heading, with the largest upward ones coming from bread and cereals (from products such as dried potted snacks, breakfast cereal and packs of inidual cakes), and meat (principally cooked ham).Pound falls after inflation data\u0026nbspThe pound is down 0.42\u0026nbspper cent against the dollar on the back of lower-than-expected-inflation.\u0026nbspSterling is at $1.245 and has dropped 0.27 per cent against the euro to €1.104.\u0026nbspPoorer areas hit hardest by disappearance of free-to-use cash machines\u0026nbspFree-to-use cash machines are vanishing more quickly in deprived areas than in affluent ones, according to consumer campaigners who are pressing Chancellor Sajid Javid to implement a cash guarantee.Which?

Within that grouping, games, toys and hobbies fell 5 per cent between July and August 2019.\u0026nbspAir fares rose by more in 2019 than in 2018 but sea fares rose by less.\u0026nbspA number of essential costs have also risen in price, including\u0026nbspthe cost of owning a home, energy bills, and council tax.\u0026nbspClothes and shoes rose in price by 1.8 per cent.Cash-starved Air India putting crews on low-fat diet\u0026nbspNEW DELHI (AP) Cash-starved Air India is putting its crew on a diet, changing their inflight menu to special low-fat meals.\u0026nbspDhananjay Kumar, the state-run airline\u0027s spokesman, said Wednesday that the objective is to provide healthy and cost-effective meals to crews on domestic and international flights.\u0026nbspKumar declined comment on media reports that the cost per meal, mostly vegetarian, will come down to one-third of existing 500-800 rupees (up to $11) per meal.\u0026nbspThe new menu was introduced Monday on flights originating from New Delhi and Mumbai and will be extended to other routes soon.\u0026nbspAssociated PressThe chancellor is, unsurprisingly, upbeat about the the latest inflation figures.\u0026nbspSajid Javid, said: “Low inflation and high wage growth means people\u0027s hard-earned cash is going further, helping them to provide for their families.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re helping with the cost of living by cutting taxes for more than 30 million people and ensuring that almost a million of our dedicated public sector workers - including our soldiers, teachers and doctors - get above-inflation pay increases.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That was well above the 75 per cent approval required.The proposal had met with staunch opposition from Lady Nadine Cobham, whose late husband Michael ran the business.She had called for the government to step in and on Wednesday welcomed the move by Ms Leadsom: “I’m delighted that the government has listened to the widespread concerns about this takeover offer and the risk it poses to high-tech jobs and our national security.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

This suggests the market does not think the government will end up blocking the deal, said Mr Wilson at Markets.But he added: “I think the risk of the government preventing this deal going through is higher than the market is indicating.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

They helped researchers confirm what kind of object the mysterious rock was – and that it was unlike anything we had ever seen before.The images show the clear tail streaming out the back of the comet, which is what identifies it as such. The tail is the result of outgassing, caused by material being spewed out the back of the object and propelling it through the universe.It is the first time any visitor to our solar system has shown such a behaviour. The only other known interstellar tourist was the object known as \u0027Oumuamua, which did not show any tail – a fact that continues to perplex astronomers to this day.The picture was nearly missed, researchers said, but was the result of astronomers rushing to take the picture soon after the msterious object was identified.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

The illustration is based on research by Nasa into this recently discovered planetA Soyuz spacecraft carrying carg and supplies comes in to dock in the International Space StationA planetary nebula (radiation emitted by a dying star) is seen in the Gemini constellation by the Hubble TelescopeNorth coast of Africa by Libya and Tunisia as seen from 260 miles above earth onboard the International Space StationThis image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamic Observatory shows our Sun in a different light. In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThis image was possible because of Gemini\u0027s ability to rapidly adjust observations and observe objects like this, which have very short windows of visibility, said Andrew Stephens of Gemini Observatory who coordinated the observations. However, we really had to scramble for this one since we got the final details at 3:00 am and were observing it by 4:45!Comet speeding towards Earth could have come from another solar systemThe newly discovered object has been called\u0026nbspC2019 Q4 (Borisov), after the Russian amateur astronomer who first spotted its unusual orbit. The photo was taken soon after it was first seen, on the night of 9-10 September, by a telescope on\u0026nbspHawaii\u0027s\u0026nbspMaunakea.To take the images, researchers took observations in two different colour bands or filters and combined them into a colour image.For now, it is difficult for researchers to see more of the comet, because it has moved near to the Sun and is therefore difficult to see. But it is expected to swing into a better position in the coming months, as it continues its mysterious journey around the solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I don’t even know how to do a – I’ve never been on a stripper pole like that in my life.”Barbash said she wishes Cardi B (who has several cameos in the movie) had portrayed her instead of Lopez.She made similar comments in an interview with\u0026nbspVanity Fair, telling the magazine she “wasn’t really that impressed” with the film – though she did praise Lopez’s work on that occasion.“I was impressed with Jennifer,” she said, “She was incredible. Her body looked incredible. She had it down to a T, but it wasn’t factual.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted a representative of STXfilms, the movie’s distributor, for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In February, The Sunday Times reported that Sir Jim and his two key lieutenants, Andrew Currie and John Reece, were planning a move to the tax-free principality of Monaco in a bid to save £4bn in UK taxes. Between them, the three men own all of Ineos’s shares.\u0026nbspThe move to build around 25,000 of the new “Projekt Grenadier” vehicles in Wales will come as a rare piece of positive news for Britain’s beleaguered car industry which has been battered by the threat of Brexit and thousands of job cuts.However, the scale of the new production is small compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars manufactured at the UK’s largest car plants.Billionaire Brexiteer to move to Monaco in bid to ‘save £4bn in tax’Secretary of State for Wales Alun Cairns said: “Ineos’s investment will provide a welcome boost to our automotive sector and to this part of Wales, creating important jobs which will contribute to a strengthened economy.

Production has dropped sharply from a peak in 2016 as car makers grapple with Brexit and falling diesel sales, among other problems.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

David Phelan has been testing the iPhone 11 for the\u0026nbsplast weekThree iPhones go on sale in a matter of days, promising improved photography, tweaked design, faster speed and something which may mean more than all of those to many: improved battery life.The new phones are the iPhone 11, the iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, replacing the iPhone XR, iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max respectively.There’s a new naming system, then. Last year, it was the iPhone XS that was the standard iPhone, with the XR seen as a cut-price alternative. Now, the successor to the XR is the definitive iPhone, simply called iPhone 11, with the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max being presented as upscale versions. It’s a subtle repositioning.All of which is fine, if the iPhone itself earns its consideration as the mainstream phone.The iPhone 11 is a direct successor to the iPhone XR in design terms. From the front, it looks identical to last year’s models, with a 6.1-inch LCD screen that goes to the edges all the way around. This is a significant achievement in itself – most LCD screens require wide bezels at top and bottom at least. Apple found a way to reach the edges with what it calls a Liquid Retina display on last year’s iPhone XR and it’s the same here. The screen looks great, though at 326 pixels per inch, it’s much less detailed than the Pro models. Sometimes text can look a little less sharp than you’d like but Apple’s new software design, such as the gleaming wallpapers, for instance, emphasise the strengths of the LCD so well, so it’s rarely an issue.The newness in the design becomes apparent when you turn the iPhone 11 so you can see the sides. The XR was available in multiple colourful finishes and that’s the same here. This is visible from the edge because the aluminium antenna band which wraps around the phone is colour-matched to what’s on the rear of the phone.The colours this time are all new. Four of the six are gently updated from last year’s black, white, yellow and red, all of which are slightly different from the iPhone XR. The other two are completely new: a green that has a minty vibrancy and a striking purple. It’s nothing like purple, in my book, but is a mouth-wateringly appealing lavender shade that looks great. It’s the standout among this year’s colours, I’d say.The other changes to the design are on the back of the phone. First, the colours shine out brilliantly, with a polished-glass finish. Gloss all over apart from the camera bump which has a matte finish.How Apple’s new iPhones compare to the competitionThe camera bump had leaked in advance, or so we thought. But it turns out it’s very different from what was expected. The general belief was that it would be a deep, solid black bump with three flush cameras in, like the iPhone XS.In fact, the lenses protrude, so the bump is much less dominant than expected and the area around the lenses is coloured to match the rest of the back of the phone, not black as on earlier multi-camera phones. These two design choices make the camera area look significantly better.By the way, yes, multi-camera. Unlike the iPhone XR, with its single snapper, there are two lenses here – of which, more later. That’s the other big change to the look of the back of the phone, though there’s one more noticeable difference.On iPhones up until now, the back has always featured the Apple logo, the word iPhone and the words “Designed in California” and “Assembled in China”. In some “S” years, that letter would be there, too. There was also the CE mark and a do not recycle graphic.Theater at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, USA, 10 September 2019 (EPAJOHN G. MABANGLO)Apart from the Apple logo itself, everything else has now gone. The logo has moved down the back to a more central position. As a result, it looks much cleaner, more elegant.In the hand, the iPhone 11 feels great. Despite its large display, it’s comfortable even in smaller hands and the smooth edges mean you can roll it through your fingers satisfyingly.The detailing is remarkable, as you would expect from Apple. The volume buttons, power button, mute switch and even the inside of the Lightning charging socket are perfectly colour-matched to the rest of the phone.The cameras here are both 12MP sensors, one wide and one ultra-wide. The iPhone 11 is significantly cheaper, £270 less than the iPhone 11 Pro, with pricing starting at £729. Last year’s iPhone XR, by the way, is still available and has dropped in price to £699.Despite the price difference there is a lot the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro share and that includes the cameras. These are identical to two of the iPhone 11 Pro’s three cameras – the Pro also has a telephoto lens.Two lenses mean that portrait mode with its sharp-focus-subject-blurred-background effect is now here with a vengeance. It was possible on the iPhone XR through software but that meant objects and, more importantly, pets didn’t register. It needed a pair of human eyes to work. Now, portrait mode works for everything. There’s also a high-contrast black-and-white mode that’s especially eye-catching.A new camera interface means the phone shows you what the wide lens sees and around the edges to fill the display with what the ultra-wide would see, if you were using that. If you decide it’s a better shot, you can switch to it. It’s a useful system and my only disappointment is that when you do flick to the ultra-wide, it no longer occupies the whole screen. However, that wouldn’t show everything the camera can see, so it’s unavoidable.Edelson  AFP)JOSH EDELSONAFPGetty Images)There’s also a new night mode which activates automatically when light is low. You can turn it off, but the results are mostly outstanding, so it’s worth letting the iPhone do its stuff. It takes multiple shots and puts them together to create an improved result. The shots are taken over a second, sometimes longer and a slider counts it down for you.The images are realistic, not impossibly bright and still catch the feeling of the moment. On a couple of occasions I found the colours were a little different from what my eyes saw but this was the exceptional, not the commonplace, result.The camera interface is also improved with a swipe mechanic on the screen to reveal extra menu options.The front-facing camera is now 12MP, too and comes with a wider field of view. When you turn the iPhone to landscape orientation, the camera knows to automatically choose that wider view. Apple also announced the slofie (I know, I know) which stands for slow-motion selfie video shot at 120 frames per second. These are actually quite fun.All these features are on the Pro phones, too, but for many, the iPhone 11 camera will be more than good enough.This is a major upgrade on all the new iPhones. The iPhone XR already had the best battery life of any iPhone and this one adds an extra hour to that. It’s hard to pin down exactly how many hours that really means, but in my testing, it has lasted from early to late every single day. This is a super-refreshing change. I’d still recommend nightly charges for peace of mind, but this is a big step forward. Anyone nursing an iPhone 7, say, whose battery may be needing a little boost during the day, will enjoy what the iPhone 11 has to offer.The release of iOS 13 on Thursday 19 September brings more features. There’s the dark mode which has proved highly popular, offering a less in-your-face design with black backgrounds instead of white. On the Pro phones with their OLED screens that will offer power saving, but not with LCD. Here it’s a clean, attractive look.Face ID, the fast, reliable and secure facial recognition system introduced on the iPhone X, is more effective now and works at more angles, so you don’t have to crane your neck forward when it’s on your desk, say – though you do still have to lean in. This improvement will also happen on the other Face ID iPhone models as it’s software-based.iPhones on 10 September, 2019, and slashed prices of older models (Apple)The processor, called A13 Bionic, is blisteringly fast. Right now, it’s easy to notice how quickly apps launch and respond when in use but as developers create more demanding apps, expect the new processor to step up to the plate.Note that the splendid 3D Touch effect of the iPhone X and XS is not here. That’s the subtle haptic feedback you get when you touch certain menus. It was replaced on the iPhone XR by Haptic Touch which works in a different way. Previously, Haptic Touch was limited in what it did but it’s now been expanded to wherever 3D Touch went. Haptic Touch is now on the Pro iPhones, too. You can feel a difference and it doesn’t feel quite as nippy as 3D Touch, but on the whole, I forgot about the change pretty much instantaneously.The new design is a gentle update, but the new iPhone is still a triumph thanks to its snazzy colours, great feel and super-fast performance. Though the display isn’t a match for the Pro models it’s still fine and works well. The considerably extended battery life will be enough to justify an upgrade for many, and the extra upgrades such as the truly excellent cameras may seal the deal.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The company needed the additional funding from investors to complete work on the mine to extract polyhalite potash, a type of fertilizer, in North Yorkshire, as well as on a transportation tunnel to Teesside.The company originally expected to obtain loans guaranteed by Britain’s Infrastructure and Projects Authority. After postponing the bond sale last month, Sirius went back to the government asking for help with raising money from investors, but the government declined, the firm said.\u0026nbspIt added that it will now slow the development of the project – which includes boring a mine more than a mile deep – as it looks for alternative sources of funding.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

But once West claimed on stage that MTV had only wanted Swift at the event for ratings purposes, Swift said that her\u0026nbspstance on him once again shifted.“I’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body,” Swift said. “I realised he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk s**t.”Created with Sketch.

The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift’s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey.A pop-punk song! Swift is at her most energetic on a song that has more than a hint of Toni Basil’s “Mickey”, from the hand-clapping beat to the distorted scuzz added to her vocals.420 17) “Miss Americana \u0026amp the Heartbreak Prince”Swift evokes Lana Del Rey again as she sings over a stuttery beat about two characters that could have been plucked right out of Hollywood’s golden age.520 16) “Back to December”This was a first for Swift, who apologises to an ex who treated her perfectly, while she perhaps didn’t value the relationship as much. It’s a noteworthy song simply to point out that Swift, who has faced multiple accusations of “using” her relationships to drag her ex-boyfriends, is more than capable of self-criticism.A Swift classic about star-crossed lovers, inspired by (what else?) Romeo and Juliet. This is a country pop song is a prime example of Swift’s skill as a story teller – one who understands the power of a forbidden romance.720 14) “Out of the Woods”   Swift emulates Bruce Springsteen on this Eighties synth-pop “get in the car and go” epic, which lasts not a second too long and ends so abruptly that it leaves you gasping to catch your breath.Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty ImagesOne of the most underrated songs on Reputation has Swift embracing the role of villain after years of being accused of using men as a songwriting tool, along with the fallout from her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. There’s so much more bite on this track than “Blank Space”, despite the similar themes – here she is merciless upon learning a man has used her name, or spent her money, behind her back. (Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty Images)There’s something very moving about Swift opening her first album with a song that intertwines the old and the new. Nashville is notoriously unkind to female country artists, particularly young ones, so you can’t help but admire a then-16-year-old Swift, who offered a profound respect to one of her biggest inspirations on her debut single.This song is essentially one big, lustful sigh: Swift seems to delight in a secret romance where she “only bought this dress so you could take it off” and quite literally pants with anticipation.Getty Images for TASA tender Sixties-style acoustic ballad that shows Swift experimenting with rhythm and meter in a way that’s impressively bold this far into her career.Dia DipasupilGetty Images for ABAWhile Red signalled Swift’s full-blown transition into pop music, she couldn’t resist putting the odd country twang on songs such as “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”, which mocks an ex for being snobbish about his “indie record label that’s much cooler than mine”. The most spectacular is really the beginning of the song, where she delivers an astounded “what?” upon being told the guy needs space: “We hadn’t seen each other in a month.”John Mayer lashed out over this song in 2012, clearly upset after Swift alluded that it was about their past relationship. He called it “cheap songwriting” in reference to using their personal lives for material – whatever you think of that, it’s features of her best vocal performances and brilliant songwriting – right down to the Mayer-ism of that wavering electric guitar line. Then there are the lyrics themselves: “You are an expert at sorry And keeping lines blurry And never impressed by me acing your tests All the girls that you’ve run dry Have tired, lifeless eyes ’Cause you burned them out.” Medic!One of Swift’s greatest talents as a songwriter is to encapsulate those small moments, often in a new relationship, that you as a listener cannot. Her skittishness on “Delicate”, about the danger of rushing into something, of sharing too much of yourself too soon with someone you’re still getting to know, is all too palpable as the beat switches up like a nervous heart.(Photo by Dimitrios KambourisGetty Images for TIME)The lyrics here are more open and willingly vulnerable than anything Swift had done before that line on the chorus where she sings: “My baby’s fly like a jet stream high above the whole scene loves me like I’m brand new” hits hard. The song appears on Reputation, released after Swift’s lengthy hiatus from the spotlight, and its lyrics speak of a person blissfully content in her relationship – to the point that the outside world is just white noise. It includes some of her finest lyrics, too, with superb references to those castles of old crumbling “overnight” and nods to her Anglophilia (“my baby’s fit like a daydream”).“Mean” is beaten only by “Our Song” as Swift’s most “country” release, helped a lot by her endearing portrait of “the slam of screen doors” and driving along country lanes listening to the radio. Swift is a master of the meta-narrative, so her making a song about a song based on sounds from real-life is all kinds of perfect.On “Getaway Car” Swift channels one of her friend and producer Jack Antonoff’s favourites – Kate Bush – as she belts that epic “go, go, go!”, while the song in its entirety recalls Bonnie Tyler’s “Total Eclipse of the Heart” – cellos and violins enhancing the drama.Getty Images for NARAS“Blank Space” was a real moment for Swift, where she turned all of the tabloid gossip, all of the malicious scrutiny around her love life, back on the world with a wink and a nod. “Got a long list of ex-lovers They’ll tell you I’m insane,” she trills on the chorus, throwing out punchline after punchline until the exquisite: “You’ll come back, each time you leave ‘cos darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream.”Against a similar soundscape to Wildest Dreams, Swift is at her most confessional as she explains how her own insecurities can lead to self-destruction in a relationship – and pleads with her lover to be patient with her. “It’s all me, in my head, she sings. I’m the one who burned us down But it’s not what I meant Sorry that I hurt you.”Swift’s mastery of storytelling has never been better than on this, a standout song not just from Red, but of her career to date. It’s the slow-build from those bittersweet memories of “dancing in the refrigerator light” to a devastating, stadium-sized anthem that leads to her delivering arguably her best-ever line – with one of her best vocal performances: “You call me up again just to break me like a promise So casually cruel in the name of being honest.”This song is sadly marred by the controversy that surrounded its accompanying video (its references to films such as Out of Africa drew accusations that it presented a “white colonialist fantasy”.) The track itself is a dreamy, lush soundscape filled with breathless sighs and dramatic pauses that recall Swift’s fellow old Hollywood obsessive, Lana Del Rey.A pop-punk song! Swift is at her most energetic on a song that has more than a hint of Toni Basil’s “Mickey”, from the hand-clapping beat to the distorted scuzz added to her vocals.420 17) “Miss Americana \u0026amp the Heartbreak Prince”Swift evokes Lana Del Rey again as she sings over a stuttery beat about two characters that could have been plucked right out of Hollywood’s golden age.520 16) “Back to December”This was a first for Swift, who apologises to an ex who treated her perfectly, while she perhaps didn’t value the relationship as much. It’s a noteworthy song simply to point out that Swift, who has faced multiple accusations of “using” her relationships to drag her ex-boyfriends, is more than capable of self-criticism.A Swift classic about star-crossed lovers, inspired by (what else?) Romeo and Juliet. This is a country pop song is a prime example of Swift’s skill as a story teller – one who understands the power of a forbidden romance.720 14) “Out of the Woods”   Swift emulates Bruce Springsteen on this Eighties synth-pop “get in the car and go” epic, which lasts not a second too long and ends so abruptly that it leaves you gasping to catch your breath.Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty ImagesOne of the most underrated songs on Reputation has Swift embracing the role of villain after years of being accused of using men as a songwriting tool, along with the fallout from her feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian. There’s so much more bite on this track than “Blank Space”, despite the similar themes – here she is merciless upon learning a man has used her name, or spent her money, behind her back. (Photo by Mark MetcalfeGetty Images)There’s something very moving about Swift opening her first album with a song that intertwines the old and the new.

If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.’”On Lover, Taylor Swift is an artist excited to be earnest againEverything you need to know about Taylor Swift’s new tourSwift then claimed to Rolling Stone that West had also been involved in the exposing of Drake’s secret love child with the French model Sophie Brussaux, which became public knowledge\u0026nbspvia a diss track by the rapper Pusha T. West has denied that he had anything to do with the Pusha T song.“He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake’s family and their lives,” Swift claimed. “It’s the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you. I really don’t want to talk about it anymore because I get worked up, and I don’t want to just talk about negative s**t all day, but it’s the same thing. Go watch Drake talk about what happened.”Swift also used the interview to talk about her politics, white supremacy, her maligned “girl squad” and her thoughts on her former record label boss Scott Borchetta.Her new album Lover was released last month to rave reviews.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The average monthly shortfall for these clients was £365.Unexpected life events were the biggest causes of problem debt.Those experiencing a reduction in income (18 per cent), injury or illness (16 per cent) or unemployment or redundancy (16 per cent) made up the bulk of new clients.StepChange said its figures “underline the growing number of households in the United Kingdom struggling to keep their heads above water, particularly when faced with a sudden change in personal circumstances”.Phil Andrew, chief executive of StepChange Debt Charity, said: “These statistics provide a sobering assessment of the scale of problem debt in this country.Surge in councils using bailiffs to chase debts“Across the board, we are seeing red flags, including worrying proportions of new clients falling into debt due to reduced income, illness or because they rely on credit to pay for day-to-day living expenses.“Clearly more and more households are struggling to hang on and are ill-equipped to deal with any economic shocks the future may hold.He said the figures “must act as a wake-up call to the Government”, with issues around bailiff behaviour and the five-week wait people have before they receive their first Universal Credit payments.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This proportion has risen by a third since 2014, when 18 per cent of new clients were single parents.Nine in 10 single parent clients were renters. Single parents were also particularly likely to have higher outgoings than incomes.StepChange said the rapid growth in single-parent clients suggests they are being squeezed by benefits payments and the rising cost of living.A Government spokeswoman said: “We are determined to help families improve their lives through work, while continuing to support them with the cost of living.“But we know some families need more support, which is why we spend more than £95 billion a year on working age benefits.“With Universal Credit, people can get paid urgently if they need it, and 700,000 families will get on average £285 more a month because the system is simpler.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

He added that the lower clothing prices may be due to unusually wet weather keeping shoppers away and prompting discounting by retailers.Slower inflation may be good for consumers in the short term but it also rings alarm bells for economists.\u0026nbsp“The falling inflation rate could be an early signal of a cooling economy, in line with what we have seen in the US and the euro area,” said\u0026nbspYael\u0026nbspSelfin, chief economist at\u0026nbspKPMG\u0026nbspUK.“Recent falls in the value of the pound and the spike in oil prices over the weekend should boost the headline rate in the coming months, with higher prices for fuel and for imported goods putting pressure on households’ purchasing power and business margins, and further curtailing demand.”Separate data from the ONS showed that average house prices increased by 0.7 per cent\u0026nbspin July compared with a year earlier, only half the rate in June and the weakest pace of growth since September 2012.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The reason for this discrepancy lies in the different inflation metrics used, the think tank says.When estimating GDP, or the value of national output, government statisticians adjust it for inflation, applying what is known as the GDP deflator. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says it is the broadest measure of inflation in the UK economy, reflecting changes in the price of all goods and services that make up GDP, whether or not they involve consumers.When fine-tuning GDP in its own analysis, the NEF used a narrower measure of inflation – one that tracks chances in consumer prices, including the costs of owning and maintaining a home.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A surfer in action during sunrise at Tynemouth on the north east coastProtesters dressed as the Incredible Hulk and Robocop outside the Supreme Court in London where judges are due to consider legal challenges to Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s decision to suspend Parliament.

Analysis of incomes of people born between 1920s and 1990s revealed that, up until those born in the 1970s, each generation has tended to be better-off than people born a decade earlier were at the same age.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rival taxi app Lyft, which floated in March, is about 40 per cent down.Beyond tech stocks, SmileDirectClub, which sells alternatives to orthodontic braces, managed to raise $1.35bn (£1bn) from investors before its shares plummeted 28 per cent in their first day’s trading last week.WeWork has been criticised in some quarters as an extreme example of hype over substance, having already racked up losses in excess of $3bn\u0026nbsp(£2.4bn) while spending freely on expansion. The firm leases offices on long-term contracts before renting them out on short-term contracts to companies and freelancers.That leaves it potentially vulnerable in a downturn when its customers seek to cut costs by ending their tenancy. Despite the simple business model, WeWork markets itself as a technology company that is changing the way people work and has attempted to value itself accordingly.Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, summed up a widely held view: “It would appear that WeWork has missed the boat when it comes to getting investors to buy into an idea that has yet to prove profitable.”With the company losing $2 for every $1 it makes, even a valuation as low as $15bn\u0026nbsp(£12bn) and $18bn (£14.4bn)\u0026nbsphasn’t been enough to whet investor appetite, particularly since a number of this year’s unicorns are now languishing below their IPO launch prices.“As Uber can attest, a popular business model doesn’t always translate into a realistic valuation and looking at WeWork’s numbers it is hard to make a case for the type of valuation being asked for now, let alone the one we saw at the beginning of the year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

We do not eat them, and that is a very important message to send to the rest of the world.“It’s not culturally insensitive because we’re not telling them what to do – we’re just telling them what we do.“We shouldn’t be worrying about that, so I was surprised that was the MoJ’s objection.”Justice officials also argued that it would be dficult to enforce the law and the current ban on transporting or exporting dog and cat meat suffices.Eating dog is already banned in Germany, Austria, Taiwan, South Australia and Hong Kong.An estimated  million dogs a year are slaughtered to be eaten, across China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.Most are stolen off the street.Their meat it is considered both a delicacy and a health tonic.The World Dog Alliance mounted a campaign in the UK last year for a full ban on any activity relating to the eating of dogs.A series of MPs back a ban, including former Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan who dubbed it “a disgusting habit”.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: “We currently have some of the strongest animal welfare laws in the world.The government is currently considering whether any changes are needed in this area in the UK and will set out any plans in due course.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity. I’ve seen this a million times. You’ve wasted a massive opportunity, guys.”The miracle was he didn’t snap earlier and far more often, as there were plenty of other acts absolutely begging for the red buzzers.Prime targets included: Mrs screechy pants, from Spain, Christina Ramos, DJ Arch, who won South Africa’s Got Talent aged three, presumably beating a two-year-old ventriloquist, and those Lebanese caterpillar dancers, Mayyas, from Beirut, whose reception owed a lot more to good manners than entertainment value.Picking two winners was, by contrast, a much harder task. But David Walliams’ golden buzzer went to Nico And Paddy, an -year-old salsa dancer whose signature move is the unravelling toilet roll drop, while the overall Wembley Arena winner was correctly judged to be Canadian escapologist Darcy Oake, who now faces the usual BGT challenge of doing something “even more dangerous” for the final. A simple solution presents itself.Get the Lebanese dancers to handcuff you inside that box, then see how quickly you escape, smart-a**e.CALLING out around the world, are you ready for a cookery heat Summer’s here and the time is right for basting turkey meat.Apologies to Marvin Gaye, William “Mickey” Stevenson and Ivy Jo Hunter for the dreadful liberties just taken with their Motown classic, but it’s not every day a genuine music legend rocks up in the BBC Celebrity MasterChef kitchen.And as well as Kiss FM DJ Rickie Haywood-Williams, Grammy-nominated singer Martha Reeves was also present, marinading cod and being told off by Gregg Wallace for over-seasoning a turkey burger for her troubles.She seemed to enjoy the experience as well.I just hope Martha was paying proper attention to the health and safety lecture head chef at the Kricket restaurant, Will Bowlby, gave fellow team member Greg Rutherford at the tandoor oven.“It rises in temperature to between  and  degrees.“You do not want to look over it, ’cos . . . ”It’s like a heatwave.MEANWHILE, on EastEnders, Ade Edmondson has reappeared, on Jean’s cancer ward, in a characteristically happy-go-lucky mood as Daniel.“I’ve got absolutely nothing to live for. I can’t even get aroused when Fiona Bruce comes on telly.”And Jenner Saunders  No. Silly question.Kane Robinson and Ashley Walters’ mesmerising performances as Sully and Dushane, on Netflix’s Top Boy.Mark Wright’s genuinely fascinating Who Do You Think You Are  drawing a direct line between Towie and the Spanish inquisition.GMB’s hungover host Piers Morgan making such a perfect Brexit idiot of shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, on my favourite show, she did the left-wing equivalent of pressing the ejector seat button and yelped: “Food banks.”S Club ’s Paul Cattermole appearing at the First Dates Hotel, looking uncannily like Charlie Higson.And Goggleboxer Pete giving brilliant context to the claim the singer had been, “Beaten around by the industry”, by pointing out: “For £. an hour I had my arm shoulder deep in s***. And HE’S been ‘beaten around by the industry ’”Gemma Collins, Arg and all those other Z-list celebrities who think turning up late for everything is a charming personality quirk.Planner-knackering programmes that last exactly one hour . . . and five minutes.An advert for Britain’s smuggest and touchiest television network, Channel , maintaining, “complaints welcome”.First Dates maitre d’ Fred Sirieix being a little bit more in love with fame than is healthy.And Odd One Out, with Jesy Nelson of Little Mix, which really wasn’t the replacement for the Paul Daniels’ masterpiece I was hoping for or expecting.Well, fairly sure.DAVE, Wednesday, pm: Comedians Giving Lectures.THIS week’s winner is football pundit Danny Murphy and That Yellow B*stard from Sin City.Sent in by Dean Edmunds.

Money does not cushion grief.I find it hard to imagine how anyone could read the excerpt of Cameron’s biography published at the weekend discussing the short le of his son and not be incredibly moved on the human level that should unite us all — regardless of politics. It brought tears to my eyes, although I had heard it all before from him and his we, as well as living through  years of similar traumatic experiences.His anguish at carrying his adored son in his arms for the last time was palpable.Perhaps I am just someone who shares some of Cameron’s “privileged pain” as the privately educated parent of a child with profound disability.Thankfully my daughter has survived complex epilepsy, among other problems, to reach adulthood.Yet like Cameron, I was plunged into the darkness of despair after the birth of a child with disabilities disrupted my le. Only later did I learn this was a form of grief as parents mourn the child they expected and come to terms with changed realities.We met soon after Ivan’s birth, a routine lunch between a journalist and MP turning into an intense discussion of shared experiences. Later we spoke about the impact on our lives and politics, even swapping notes on trusted doctors and schools.Cameron told me of struggling to take in diagnosis of Ivan’s Ohtahara syndrome, when a doctor said their son faced, “very serious dficulties”. He askedthis meant Ivan might have trouble with maths or much worse “I’m afraid it means he probably won’t walk or talk,” replied the paediatrician.For any family, rich or poor, this moment is a shock as dreams are shattered. Then comes a struggle to hold a family together, to retain jobs and relationships, to fight for education, respite and support in a system that seems often so uncaring.Your background makes little dference when filling in endless forms with the same details, searching for a school that might take your sick child, struggling with a seizure in a park, trying to find a public toilet to change a soiled pad or banging your head against blasé bureaucrats to win a few hours of respite care to retain sanity.Even at the world-famous Great Ormond Street Hospital we endured doctors who never read case notes, ed phone calls or responded to emails. One lost key files at a critical time another was a le-saver I will never forget.Exhausted families cling to such saviours as they navigate an overloaded, maze-like system filled with officials feuding over budgets. It seems almost asit is designed to inflame the distress of parents struggling under intense stress.This is recognised by this newspaper’s Give It Back campaign, demanding the Government plugs a £million-a-year funding gap and calling for a joined-up care system to help ensure families can live some semblance of normal le.Cameron wrote about the “torture” of seeing his son’s “small frame racked with spasms and what looked like searing pain” and feeling so helpless to stop the distress.However many times you see such seizures, the suffering never stops — as I felt again on Sunday afternoon watching my beautul daughter endure a series of fits that eventually needed emergency medication.As any parent knows all too well — hearing the hideously familiar screams while seeing the flailing limbs and rolling eyes — epilepsy can be a fatal condition.There are joys too, of course — but the pain of such parenthood is profound, the agonies seared deep in the soul, the struggles seem remorseless.And that is for everyone — whether rich or poor.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

it’s a public health crisis and it ends today.Speaking on public radio on Monday, he said: We dont really know the health consequences of these devices.The number of high school students using e-cigarettes has more than doubled over the past two years, according to preliminary federal data released last week.Their research found that . per cent of school kids reported using an e-cigarette in the past month.Last week, the Trump administration announced plans to remove all flavoured e-cigarettes from store shelves.Nearly  people around the country have been stricken with a lung illness that is potentially vaping-related, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Investigators have said they are trying to understand what causes the illnesses.Michael Frennier, president of the New York State Vapour Association, criticised the New York ban.He said the recent spike in deadly lung illnesses was tied to illicit vaping of the marijuana component THC, not use of flavoured nicotine.Mr Frennier said: “It’s kind of like having a mayonnaise outbreak of E.coli and the politicians come forth and they say ‘We’re going to fix this to protect the people of our state and we’re going to ban peanut butter tomorrow morning.Meanwhile, health officials have warned people against buying vaping products on the street or using marijuana-derived oil.They have said people should avoid inhaling vitamin E acetate, an ingredient found in some vaping products.New York state Health Commissioner Dr Howard Zucker is evaluating a proposal to extend the ban on flavoured e-cigarettes to cover menthol, which was excluded from the prohibition approved on Tuesday, Cuomo’s office said.In the UK, e-cigarettes are tightly regulated for safety and quality.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSJuul Labs Inc, the leading US e-cigarette maker, has insisted that it “never marketed to youth, period,” although the company has said it regretted that some of its early advertising “was executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.”On Tuesday, Juul Labs spokesman Ted Kwong said the company agreed with the need for “aggressive category-wide action on flavoured products,” adding that it “will fully comply with local laws.”Juul last year pulled many of its flavors from retail stores and suspended its social media accounts in an effort to curb use among teenagers."},{"url":null,"title":"pregnant mum lied baby real dad","story":"Louise Boyce, , pretended new lover Nathan Leggatt was the father and took him to register the birth.Leggatt even broke down in tears at the register office and told staff: Its a bit emotional to register the babys birth.Boyce had been embroiled in a bitter split with the babys real dad Ashley Sayce and acted out of spite when she lied on the form, a court heard.But she was rumbled when social services got involved and a paternity test proved he was the tots biological father.Boyce, who is pregnant again, has now been jailed for eight months after she admitted wilfully giving  information concerning registration of a birth.Her new lover was jailed for six months after admitting the same charge at Swansea Crown Court.The court was told new mum Boyce carried out the deception because she had a desire for Legatt to be the babys dad.Andrew Evans, defending Leggatt, said he had a genuine desire to play an active role in the babys welfare and wanted to be loyal to Boyce.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A new BBC documentary last night revealed that the Queen’s unusual intervention ahead of the Scottish referendum came after a request from Mr Cameron. He suggested the monarch could ‘raise an eyebrow’ during the Scottish referendum campaign, at a time when the polls were narrowing in favour of the ‘Yes’ campaign.  He was staying at Balmoral, when a newspaper poll came out putting the Yes campaign ahead for the first time. Cameron described how it hit him “like a blow to the solar plexus” and led to a “mounting sense of panic that this could go the wrong way.”    The Queen made the surprise plea to Scots to ‘think very carefully’ about how they would vote, just a week before the September  referendum.  She told a member of the public: “I hope everybody thinks very carefully about the referendum this week.”  Mr Cameron wrote of this intervention: “I was delighted”. Scotland voted to remain in the UK by a % to % margin.A documentary about Mr Cameronaposs time in power also reveals that former chancellor George Osborne believed the Brexit referendum result was partly due to Mr Cameronstoking the idea that Brussels was to blame.Mr Osborne told the programme: We held a referendum we should never have held, and the consequences for the country are grave.    He attacked Mr Cameronaposs approach to the issue, saying: David Cameron was just one of a number of British prime ministers who had fed this idea that we were dferent than Europe, that Brussels was to blame and that the public ultimately had to have a say, and weaposve all paid a price for it in my view. I feel very sorry for what happened, and I feel responsible, I was the chancellor of the exchequer in that government, we held a referendum we should never have held, we then lost that referendum and the consequences for the country are grave, and the only thing I can plead in my mitigation is that a huge number of people wanted that referendum, and I made a case against it, but it wasnapost heard.Mr Cameron and the ex-chancellor also talked about their attempts to keep Michael Gove on their side in the referendum campaign.The ex-PM described the bombshell moment Mr Gove said he would support the Leave campaign.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMore people go hungry the longer Universal Credit operates in an area, a report reveals today. Critics have repeatedly linked rising foodbank demand to the rollout of the Government’s flagship welfare overhaul. A -page study today shows evidence for the theory.In areas where Universal Credit has been running for at least a year, foodbanks in the Trussell Trust’s network have seen a % rise in demand.In areas with the new system for at least  months it jumps to %, and leaps again to % for foodbanks in areas with Universal Credit for at least two years. Unveiling the charity’s #weekstoolong report – a reference to theof time some claimants wait to receive their first payment - Trussell Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Universal Credit should be there to anchor any of us against the tides of poverty.  “But the five-week wait fatally undermines this principle, pushing people into debt, homelessness and destitution. “In a society that believes in justice and compassion, this isn’t right - but it is something that can be fixed.” Claimed by . million people, Universal Credit has been rocked by scandals since Tory Iain Duncan Smith launched it . Minsters have repeatedly had to reform the benefit after it was bundled up with billions in austerity cuts.  But the Government has been under mounting pressure to halt the expansion of the shake-up, which rolls six working-age benefits into one. Critics said delays in receiving the first payment plunged hard-up families into poverty. Ex-Tory welfare chief Amber Rudd became the first Government minister to publicly admit a link between foodbank use and Universal Credit seven months ago. She was Work and Pensions Secretary in February when she said: “It is absolutely clear that there were challenges with the initial roll-out of Universal Credit. “The main issue which led to an increase in foodbank use could have been the fact that people had dficulty accessing their money early enough.”  The Trussell Trust study provides the starkest evidence yet of the impact of the welfare revolution on hunger. And it comes as the Mirror continues its campaign to End The Universal Credit Cruelty. Ministers have slowed the pace of the rollout, but it is still being expanded. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “This latest shocking data from the Trussell Trust clearly shows that Universal Credit is forcing people to turn to foodbanks to survive, despite ministers’ repeated efforts to explain away any link.  “It is completely wrong for people to be left waiting five weeks or more for a first payment. “Advances are not the answer they are loans that have to be paid back, pushing people further into debt and leaving them vulnerable to scams.“ Labour will stop the rollout of Universal Credit and ensure that our social security system lts people out of poverty and supports any one of us in our time of need.”Joseph Rowntree Foundation policy manager Iain Porter said: “The Trussell Trust is right that there is nothing compassionate or just about the initial five-week wait for Universal Credit. “Nor can we stand by while the system is forcing families to turn to foodbanks when it should be helping to end the need for them.

People delivered via caesarean are known to be more likely to develop allergies, asthma and a host of autoimmune diseases, which are all on the rise. UK scientists have launched the biggest ever analysis of gut bacteria which regulate our immune systems over a letime. The , samples of gut bacteria from  babies and  mothers across Britain show C-section babies got most of their gut bacteria from the hospital environment.    This compared to vaginally born babies whose “microbiome” was populated by the same bacteria as their mother’s gut. In five years, the landmark Babybiome trial will identy any harms caused by the babies lacking certain bacteria. C-sections have increased in Britain over decades and more than one in four babies are now born this way. Researchers and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists insist mums-to-be should not be put off having a C-sectiondeemed the safest option. Researchers hope to discover how caesarean-born children and adults can repopulate their gut with the bacteria they are missing. Dr Nigel Field, of University College London, said: “Babies are sterile when they are in the womb. “And the moment they are born is the moment when the immune system has a huge number of bacteria that is it presented with.    “And so the hypothesis is that moment of birth might be a sort of thermostat moment which sets the immune system for future le. “The idea is that how the immune system s through your le might be influenced with its first interactions with bacteria.” There are  million people suffering from allergic diseases in Europe and the number is expected to rise to half of the European population in . The human gut contains bacteria, viruses and fungi which have evolved over millions of years to live inside us and help our bodies . Babies born via C-section had more bacteria typically found in hospitals which were more likely to have developed resistance to antibiotics. The researchers isolated, grew and sequenced the genomes of more than  of these “pathogenic” bacteria.    This confirmed that they were the same as strains causing bloodstream infections in UK hospitals. Such bacteria do not usually cause disease while in the gut they can cause infectionsthey get into the wrong part of the body orthe immune system fails. The project will track mothers and babies from hospitals in Leicester and London. It comes after the deaths of a number of UK teenagers from food allergies. Principal study investigator Prof Peter Brocklehurst, of Birmingham University, said: “The first weeks of le are a critical window of development of the baby’s immune system, but we know very little about it. “[The microbiome] allows the body to recognise itself from non-self, and therefore not attack itself.” Author Dr Trevor Lawley, of the Wellcome Sanger Institute in London, said: “This is the largest genomic investigation of newborn babies’ microbiomes to date.

The fast food giant is trialling a move to let diners swap the toy for a fruit bag instead. It comes as Burger King axes plastic toys from kidsapos meals - and will offer free meals to people whounwanted toys. And McDonaldaposs bosses are also planning to introduce paper-based toys next year. Explaining the move, Paul Pomroy, CEO of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said: We recognise that some people may not want a plastic Happy Meal toy, but we also know that the gts provide fun for many families and children. That’s why we’ll be running these trials, in order to give our customers a choice they also can choose not to have a toy or gt at all.    It’s important we understand what our customers want and we’ll learn a lot from whether they choose a fruit bag or a book over a toy. It is the latest in a series of moves aimed at reducing plastic consumption. These include using paper straws, withdrawing plastic lids from McFlurrys, and ending the use of single-use plastic in salads. Burger Kingaposs Meltdown campaign - which starts tomorrow - will see plastic toy amnesty bins placed in every restaurant across the UK. Burger King UK marketing director Katie Evans said: “It is impossible to ignore the growing problem excessive plastic waste is causing and we are glad to be taking action.    At Burger King we know we can positively contribute to finding new, more sustainable solutions, long term. “We’re inviting customers to donate their unwanted plastic toys and working with Pentatonic, we’re excited to give them a fresh start.

Baby Ellie was diagnosed with the condition that affects the pigmentation of her skin, hair and eyes, as well as her sight - meaning she is likely to be classed as legally blind. Her loving mum Hollie Dunlea, , has now come to terms with her beautul babyaposs diagnosis.She has told RSVP Live she will do everything she can as a mum to defend her daughter from nasty people she worries will bully Ellie over her appearance as she grows up.Albinism is a congenital disorder affecting  in , people. Little Ellie was diagnosed with Oculocutaneous Albinism at just  weeks old after her birth on October , .    She couldnapost see shadows until she was six months old. Her mum, from Cork, has revealed her initial dismay when confronted with her babyaposs medical condition. She said: “The diagnosis was made  weeks after her birth andI’m honest, I was devastated. “I will never forget my midwe telling us ‘weaposre having a blonde baby’ and Ronan, Ellieaposs dad repeating it while giving me a kiss. Next thing, the nurse followed on with ‘actually, it’s kind of white.’ Not reading into it, Ellie was placed on my chest and my Mom was called in. She says to this day, she knew Ellie was ‘albino’ the minute she set eyes on her white head. The next morning doctors, nurses, students, midwives, you name it - we had it, came to see ‘the baby with the white hair.’ This was what she was known as around the ward.”    The -year-old found her daughteraposs diagnosis dficult to deal with revealing: “It was asI mourned the ‘perfect child’. Whether it be your first child or your fth, we all want nothing more than our babies to be happy and healthy. To think of any harm or dficulties coming their way would kill any mom. I know there is so much worse out there. But this, for me, was heartbreaking to hear.” Soon after the birth, Hollie noticed that she was starting to hide her daughters Albinism: “I didn’t want people to now look at her as ‘the Albino’. I just wanted people to see her as ‘the baby with the white hair’. I think these days, when there is a name for something, people instantly think that they’re sick or they won’t have a ‘normal’ le. You find people saying ‘oh I’m sorry to hear’ because doctors have diagnosed your child with something. I didn’t want that to be the case for Ellie. Sight or no sight, she is my little girl and I want nothing but the best for her. People can be so nasty.” The part time model hopes that daughter Ellie will grow up knowing dferent is good: “When people asked me before ‘is she Albino’  It was asthey hit me in the stomach. Straight away I put up a defense. Now, I am trying to say ‘yes she is, isn’t her hair amazing ’. I want it to be a positive thing. Because it’s certainly not a negative.    She continued: “Although Ellie can see us when we’re close by, she can still be classed as ‘legally blind’, meaning she will never be able to drive, she may even need a cane when she’s older, she will have to wear sunscreen for most of the year. Simple things like going to the cinema, or going into Penney’s may be more of a challenge than others but we’ll deal with them when we get there.” The mother-of-one is determined her daughter will be like every other child her age: “I was told to raise Ellie like any ‘normal’ child.

Elena Smith was excited to take up a job doing dancing sets at events in a posh hotel in Marrakesh. But the st dancer was left devastated and alleges she was fired just a week after being urged to lose weight by her manager. The hotel denies she was fired and instead says she chose to leave. The -year-old dancer, who exercises daily and eats healthily, said the alleged comments almost derailed her from a aposstarve then bingeapos eating disorder she overcame earlier this year.  She has spoken out to raise awareness of pressures on women working in the dance industry. Elena, from Epsom, Surrey, said: My manager told me that the bosses at the hotel had complained that I was too fat and that they were thinking of firing me because of it. I was totally shocked. Since Iaposd arrived in Marrakesh, Iaposd lost weight because of training anyway, so to hear they thought I was too fat was really surprising. I explained that I was going to the gym every day and eating healthy food and that I knew my own body so there wasnapost anything more I could really do, but they just told me I had to find a way to lose weight.  I was handed my final pay and told that the bosses no longer wanted me because I was too fat. This is a very looks based industry which people have to become thick skinned, but a lot of people, especially young girls, in this industry are vulnerable and suffer massively from eating disorders, anxiety and depression. Focusing on weight and body size like they do in the performing industry can have such a long lasting damaging effect on people, both physically and mentally. Elena applied for the job in April  by sending pictures and videos of herself and taking part in a FaceTime interview, she said.  She landed the job of performing in a dinner and show with other dancers for hotel guests in Marrakesh, and flew out in June  to join the team. It involved performing in between short sets in dferent styles, including commercial, contemporary and jazz. Elena was hired to work from June  until January , but claims she was fired in August. She said: I was made to feel really self conscious about my weight and how my body looked, and they put me under extreme amounts of pressure as they told me to lose weight as soon as possible. My manager said that she was going to fight for me so that I didnapost have to leave, and I managed to lose a further kg in a week, but when I went in the following Saturday, I was told I didnapost have a job any more. They wouldnapost even pay for my flight home, even though my contract said they would, so I had to get my dad to book them for me.  Elena says she first faced body shaming in the industry during her training to become a professional dancer back when she was a teenager. She said: I never had any problems with food or exercise or how my body looked until I started training to become a dancer and was weighed constantly. Itaposs definitely a pressure that comes with being in the performing industry. I remember being in one audition where a  told a group of us that one of the reasons we were being cut was because of our bodies.

Yes some people do ‘snap back’ really quickly and bloody good on them because it’s so hard to sht this weight, especially when you’re knackered and just want to eat rubbish food all the time. I just had to say, pictures can be deceiving, mum tum or not it’s really easy to disguise what you truly look like. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, it makes you feel  times better and I do it myself everyyyyy day!!    This is me  months pp one pic with my knickers pulled over my tum to make it look better  my reality. Aliciaaposs post received a massive response from mums, with hundreds of reactions and comments, many of them praising her honesty and sharing their own experiences of tucking their mum tums in their jeans. It can be so hard when weaposve done amazing things with our bodies that everyone needs to remember causes them to change, said one. Need to learn to love yourself because youaposre all amazing.

Neil Parker, , from Queensland, Australia, was trekking alone on Sunday at Cabbage Tree Creek, near Brisbane when he fell  feet over the edge of the waterfall. The experienced hiker told the reporters from his hospital bed on Wednesday: I cartwheeled and slammed into the rock and landed in the creek at the bottom. He said he had to carry his leg after it clean snapped in half and the whole bottom of his limb came loose.    He also fractured his wrist during the fall. Neil damaged his phone in the waterfall and he decided to self-rescue and crawl to a clearing where he hoped he would be seen. He told of his agonising journey to the reporters: Iaposd get about a metre, a metre-and-a-half, each time before I had to stop and take a break. I just couldnapost believe it. Itaposs only kmbut it took two days to cover km. I was thinking that I was never going to get there.    His family launched a search operation with the help of Brisbane Bushwalkers community on Monday. A search-and-rescue helicopter spotted Neil and winched him to safety the next afternoon before taking him to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane.

The part of town where Dundee Harp was founded is long removed, but that section of town was still there in the s.”Rob continued as he traced Dundee Harp’s once fertile source of talent: “We can start at Pat Cassady’s barber shop, or across the street at the premises of Terry McMahon’s pub – The Harp.“Both were on Brook Street in the Westport area of Dundee, otherwise known as The Burn. Heading east towards City Square, to the right past Daniels brae, you pass the Burn Bar.“A quick look inside would probably see brothers Pat and Jim Sturrock pouring sumptuous pints of heavy, and Eddie Greenan would normally be standing at the far end of the bar.“A bit further on, you would be at the Blackness Road junction before heading down the Blackie past the Blue Mountains, and now entering the bustling shopping expanse of the West Port.“With the Globe Bar visible in a rear-view mirror, crossing over Tay Street reveals the Overgate. This historic artery had a pulse and an energy all to itself.“Those memorable stretches of the old town nurtured the players who turned out for Dundee Harp FC.”Rob revealed that Arbroath had a star defender, a local lad called Tom O’Kane.Rob went on: “He took no prisoners and could leather a ball from one end of the pitch to the other.“At the beginning of the - season, Tom was poached and somehow persuaded to leave his home team to sign for Dundee Harp.“The town of Arbroath was outraged at the smash-and-grab by Harp.“Were underhand means used to attract O’Kane “Probably.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/SNS-19281556-MS-Dundee-v-Alloa.jpg ","title":"dundee boss mcpake blasts horrific decision that could have cost side three points","story":"Dundee boss James McPake blasted referee Alan Newlands for a “horric decision” that could have cost his side a vital three points.The Dens gaffer was annoyed to be talking about what he said was “as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see” when he should have been talking up a “controlled” win over a good Alloa Athletic side.The spot-kick would have given the Dark Blues the opportunity to see the game out easier as the Wasps piled on the pressure late on.McPake said: “It was a horric decision that could have in the end cost us – I have to say I don’t like criticising referees but it’s decisions like that that can cost points.“We had one at Tannadice that I was honest enough to say wouldn’t have mattered in the grand scheme of things but that one really could have mattered.“It was as blatant a penalty on Cammy Kerr as you’re likely to see.“I’m being genuine when I say I don’t like doing it because they have a hard enough job as it is but it was as stonewall penalty as I’ve seen.“They said nobody saw it.“I end up talking about something I shouldn’t be when I should be talking about the dominant display from us.”First-half goals from Danny Johnson and Jordan McGhee either side of Liam Dick’s th-minute equaliser for the visitors were enough to give McPake’s side victory.“It was a good three points,” he added.“I thought the performance was decent in spells. Alloa were decent, we knew they would be, and credit to them for playing some good football.“We really controlled large parts of that game and I thought the front three were a real threat. Josh McPake was excellent, it was a good first start for the kid, and Fin Robertson coming back was very controlled in the middle of the park.“I thought he dictated the play for large spells. In the last  minutes, we got a bit deeper but we saw it through.”Josh McPake limped off in the second half with a dead calf but should be fine for next weekend while Jamie Ness wasn’t risked after his ankle knock. Josh Meekings missed Saturday’s game due to a family issue."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d0a1aeceb3cc1.83894608-e1560950829866.jpg ","title":"dundee united skipper reynolds says team have to bounce back after ayr defeat","story":"Dundee United skipper Mark Reynolds has issued a warning to his team-mates that they can#t get too down after Saturday’s - loss to Ayr United.United were poor in defeat at Somerset Park as a Daniel Harvie strike and Alan Forrest penalty spoiled their perfect start to the Championship season and brought the Honest Men level with the league-leading Terrors.Failing to stretch their advantage at the top of the table was a blow only compounded further by wins for challengers Inverness and Dundee.The Tangerines were feeling a little sorry for themselves at full-time in Ayr but Reynolds insists those are emotions they must temper as they aim to get back on track against Arbroath at Tannadice this weekend.“It was just one of those days but we’re absolutely gutted and I’m sure the fans are, too,” the -year-old said.“We’ve worked hard to get them back on side, we’ve won four games on the bounce in the league. That was good momentum but it’s also a reminder that it can so easily just be dashed.“We just need to keep going the course. We’ve always spoken about one game at a time and I think that works both ways – you don’t get too high when it’s going well and you don’t get too low when it’s going against you.“We’ve looked at it early this week and seen why we weren’t as good as we should have been.“As we have done with everything, we’ve looked at all the details to see what we can do better and to stop that happening again.“We’ll be looking for a reaction on Saturday.”United host the Red Lichties just a fortnight after Dick Campbell’s side dumped them out of the Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup on penalties.Although United fielded a makesht team that day, defender Reynolds is wary of the quality Arbroath possess and has warned they must be on their game to see them off this time.“Arbroath are a good side, they’re going well and picking up results,” he added.“We saw that first hand in the cup – we still put out a decent enough team and we’ll need to be on our game.“If we turn up and play the way we did on Saturday, we’ll be in trouble. We’ll go away, look at the tapes from the cup game and see what we need to do to beat them.“We’ll re-group and go again. We said at the start, even after winning the first four games on the spin, it’s a long season and it’s a hard league.“People will drop points when you don’t expect it and there’ll be twists and turns. All we can do is focus on ourselves and we’ll focus on the Arbroath game on Saturday. That’s as far as we’ll look.”Former Aberdeen man Reynolds lined up alongside his third central-defensive partner of the league season last weekend as Troy Brown made his debut.And Reynolds admits he is hoping to find a settled relationship with Brown or Calum Butcher while Mark Connolly remains out injured.“You can see there’s a quality player there but, as with anyone that comes in, it’s going to take a bit of time to get used to the way we play and what the manager wants us to do.“I’m sure he’ll get there, he’s settled in well and the more game time he gets the better he will become.“It’s been dficult but, when Butch has come in, we’ve done well. Obviously Troy’s in there now and it’s about trying to get a relationship as quick as we can.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcc130e61.72848189.jpg ","title":"in form keeper hamilton impresses mcpake after strong display for dundee

six clean sheets.James said: “Jack made a great save from the penalty.“He’s been great since I came in and was too when I was with the reserves last season.“I’ve said before how good a character he is around the dressing-room but above all he is a good goalkeeper and he proved that again on Saturday.“He was excellent.“He came for crosses late on that took real pressure off us.“I thought the defence

their last six games in the city, five at home and one at Tannadice.Heading to Greenock, James knows it’ll be a dficult day against David Hopkin’s Morton.He added: “It’s weird because it feels like we

rehabilitation from a knee injury at Pittodrie.The -year-old is expected toto full fitness from a cruciate ligament injury in late October or early November.Hoban suffered the season-ending setback while on loan with Aberdeen from the Premier League Hornets in February.Now a free agent having been released by Watford, Hoban has taken up McInnes’ offer of help with his rehabilitation.McInnes said: “Tommie has indicated he will take us up on our invitation to come up over the next two to three weeks to do some training with us.“Tommie is still working through his rehab.”Hoban sustained damage to his anterior cruciate ligament in Aberdeen’s - draw with St Mirren at Pittodrie on February .He subsequently underwent surgery on the second serious knee injury the versatile defender had suffered in two years.Hoban was ruled out for the whole of the - season having suffered a cruciate ligament injury during pre-season training with Watford in summer .The injury suffered on loan at Pittodrie was to the other knee.Such is Hoban’s connection with McInnes and the Dons squad he travelled up to Hampden from England during his rehab to cheer on the Reds in the Scottish Cup semi-final.He sat with the other injured Aberdeen players at Hampden in the - loss to Celtic.In May this year Hoban admitted to the Evening Express that he would consider signing permanently for Aberdeen when he ed to full fitness andhe was a free agent.On there being potential for Hoban signing for Aberdeenfully fit, McInnes said: “It is too premature that it is something that would automatically happen.“But it is not something that we think definitely wouldn’t happen either.“I enjoyed working with Tommie and he enjoyed working here.”The knee injury was the second setback Hoban suffered during his time at Pittodrie.Following an impressive start to his Dons career he sustained a shoulder injury playing against Hibs at Easter Road that ruled him out for five months.Hoban was only six games into his comeback from that shoulder injury when he suffered fresh injury hell when tearing an anterior cruciate ligament and suffering cartilage damage against St Mirren.McInnes said: “Tommie got a sore injury in an Aberdeen strip and there is a duty of care we feel.“And a feeling from us that we would like to try and help him.”Meanwhile Aberdeen boss Derek McInnes could have seven first team players out injured for Saturday’s league trip to Livingston.Centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor are definitely ruled out with hamstring injuries.Taylor will notuntil after the international break next month although McKenna couldbefore then.Midfielder Stephen Gleeson has ed to running in training having undergone knee surgery during pre-season.However the Republic of Ireland international is out for the trip to Livi.Winger Scott Wright is out for the season with a cruciate ligament injury suffered in training last week.McInnes is sweating on scan results on injuries suffered by midfielders Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson during the - draw with St Johsntone.Bryson suffered an ankle injury and left Pittodrie after the game in a protective boot while Ojo limped off with a tight hamstring.Jon Gallagher was taken to hospital for an X-Ray with fears he had suffered a fractured tibia against Saints.However the X-rays confirmed the leg was not fractured and he may be in contention to face Livingston on Saturday."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.45169886-1-240x180.jpg

As soon as the original project was launched in  and then again when it was relocated, it was clear that there is tremendous enthusiasm, pride and curiosity about it.“We are delighted that this project can be continued thanks to funding from Aberdeen City Council.“Now it is over to the public to make their local hero nominations and we would like to encourage people, of all ages, across the city and wider north-east to come forward with their Everyday Hero suggestions.”Members of the public who have nominated the chosen heroes will also be given the opportunity to help produce the artwork honouring the people they have picked to be honoured.Marie Boulton, the council’s culture spokeswoman, said: “We are delighted to be supporting the next stage of the project through the Creative Funding programme and would encourage nominations from across our communities.”Nominees must have lived or worked in Aberdeen for part of their le and can be someone famous or known only to a few, living or dead.To make a nomination visit aberdeeninspired everydayheroes.The deadline for all nominations is October ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/09/5d728b69170679.16363937-400x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet mouse cuddles and marigold all need a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable animals from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home  vw, px\"  This sweet girl is four years old, she is full of character and loves everyone she meets.She has been around dogs previously and has mixed well with other dogs while she has been in the kennels.She is used to children from four years and over, but would not be suitable to be homed around cats.She will need a new home with access to a secure garden so that she can play with her toys and enjoy some sunshine. vw, px\"  This lovely girl is four years old.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

This has been communicated to the providers of the mobile banking service previously.#An alternative location, at the Newton car park where no fees would be charged, has been suggested in the past and remains an option.#Previous parking spots for the mobile unit, including one beside the former RBS building, have proved unsuitable because of traffic and parking conflicts.The Argyllshire Advertiser approached RBS for comment but the bank failed to respond."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column september 13 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe dficult financial times we live in makes for tough choices on spending, there is no doubt about that.The decision to close Ashfield school in Achnamara was dficult, but it was based on educational reasons, according to the committee.Barring appeal it#s a done deal, but the building remains.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Going into a business or a jobs market, there is going to be technology like this that we need to be able to use.Millie Macdonald, a -year-old S pupil, commented: ldquoFrom what I have experienced in primary school last year I think the iPads have made quite a big dference in peoplersquos lives.ldquoPreviously, I was taking all of my books and pens to school, which was a bit of a nuisance, but with the iPads itrsquos not something yoursquore likely to forget because itrsquos a piece of technology, whereas with notes and pens people used to forget to bring them, sometimes on purpose.ldquoWe have been using Microsoft OneNote and Whiteboard quite a lot, and Kahoot, which is an interactive quiz game which is fun and educational.ldquoWe use OneNote as a filing system, where we add folders with our homework, filed under each subject such as French or biology.ldquoI donrsquot think my parents were very keen on the idea at the time, but now theyrsquove had a talk and heard my brothers and myself talking about it theyrsquove come around to the iPads.Speaking after the demonstration lesson, council leader Shona Haslam said: ldquoThe roll out has gone so well, wersquove had such good engagement from the young people and parents at Selkirk High School, so itrsquos a real big thank youto them for taking this onboard, and as you can see today what dference it has made to learning.ldquoThe cost of the Inspire Learning project needs put into context: the digital learning roll out is just one per cent of the overall education budget per year, for ten years.ldquoIt seems like a lot of money but when you look at it in the wider context of the budget itrsquos actually quite affordable.ldquoOf course, teachers remain the most important part of our education system, this is just an additional tool that allows them to teach better and to do their jobs better.ldquoThere is quite a lot of restrictions on the iPads in terms of sharing photos and videos from them. What they also allow the schools to do is look at the use of phones in school as well.ldquoPreviously, kids would take photos of their homework on their phones, which they can now do on their iPads,

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards. Anything is possible in a story.But thatrsquos just in stories eh  Itrsquos not real magic.Well lets us imagine for a moment that we actually did live in the world of a story that animals could really talk and a frog could transform into a prince with a kiss, that dragons and witches flew in the sky, animals spoke to us and wishes could be granted by magical creatures and spells cast.If we lived in this story world then wersquod soon take all this magic for granted. Wersquod stop noticing it, or even commenting on it.We wouldnrsquot see it as magic or unusual because it would be everyday stuff.ldquoYea yea, there goes another dragon come on wersquore late, yes that man used to be a frog, yes that wizard makes spells and that woman can make wishes come true, so what. Donrsquot speak to that squirrel wersquove no time to talk.But of course we do live in a magic world, a world just as magical as any story world. Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

The organ was out of action for two years while all the conservation work at St Michaelrsquos was being done but has been played again since mid-July.During this time a digital organ, linked to the kirkrsquos sound system, was used as a temporary measure.Restoration work to the Lewis organ, which is situated in the church sanctuary, included some leathering work to the bellows and electrical and mechanical repairs carried out including replacement of the old electrical transformer unit.The instrument was originally made by Lewis and Company, founded by Thomas Christopher Lewis , one of the leading organ builders of late th century Britain.Mr Shaw said further restoration of the organ would be carried out in the futurefunding was obtained.

Prior to that, Irsquod been a regular reader of Mandy and Judy but now, now I was fully adult.From then, I never missed an issue.What lured me in, I think, was the unfettered aspiration of it all. As young women can be prone to, I was never satisfied with myself and here was, essentially, a manual of betterment.The women featured - the models, the celebrities - had perfect skin, swishy hair and fashionable clothing.If I could only add up all the money I spent on skincare having read the promises of epidermal glory, Id likely have enough to pay off my mortgage.Marie Claire came as an addition to Glamour. I liked its serious features, sitting side by side with fashion and beauty. I credit Marie Claire with introducing me to the hardships of women in developing countries, broadening my feminism and introducing me to international news.Thats right, a womans glossy. Who would have thought But womens magazines have long, long been a Trojan horse, sneaking controversial topics in among the lighter articles - whether thats through the agony aunt pages or simply a strong editorial decision.You wouldnt think it because its so easy to sneer at womens magazines - heavy on the advertising, heavier on the fluff. Melt your back fat, how to wear neon yellow eye shadow, buy these shoes at pound a pop. And its so easy to sneer at things aimed at women, to fail to take womens likes and choices seriously.Readers could learn about miscarriage and also about how to make shorts appropriate office wear, learn about hemlines and headlines.They helped to define mainstream feminism and, in the popularity contest of publicity, often went awry - Glamour, say, giving its annual Women of the Year Award tohellip Bono. A man, and not a very popular man at the best of times.The magazine was also an early adopter of the currents trans rights debate, sparky controversy when giving the newly transitioned Caitlyn Jenner the same award.Some of the most read political coverage has come from womens mags: from Teen Voguersquos op-ed on Donald Trump gas lighting America to Michael Howard being grilled on his views on abortion by Cosmopolitan magazine during the  election.When broadsheet newspapers treated ldquowomenrsquos issues as a separate, less worthy topic to be handled by one dedicated page and tabloid papers dealt with women exclusively as sex objects, womenrsquos magazines gave a voice and a place for the things that mattered to women.In an industry where female editors were a minority, magazines allowed women to reach the top. Female writers with serious clout have contributed to womens magazines: Joan Didion at Vogue Glamour had Susan Orlean and Gloria Steinem while Betty Friedan used a commission for Good Housekeeping to rip apart the medium.I cant pinpoint the moment that I stopped reading womens magazines. Partly I simply didnt have the time - there was no natural point in my day for me to pause with a magazine. Mostly I simply no longer needed the services of Glamour or Marie Claire.It slowly dawned on me over a long awakening that the pound skin cream wasnt making any discernible dferent to anything other than my bank account. I would never buy any of the clothes in any of the features because they were out of my price range.By now my current affairs came from newspapers instead.Its not the case that magazines failed to move with the times. They very much did, backing the trend towards body positivity rather than thinness at any cost introducing more politics and current affairs becoming more erse in the models they used.Magazines, though, are always aspirational, no matter how down to earth or wholesome they try to appear. Even when serious subjects were tackled in one section, there was also still the subtle message pervading the rest of the pages that you could and should be more beautul, more fashionable and buy more stuff.Buying a magazine became a bit of an event - something for a flight or a long train journey. Something to switch off with.And so it came to the point with Glamour I didnrsquot notice that, in , it had gone web-only. If there was anything I did need, I would Google it. You would think somebody working in an industry dependent on print sales would be more mindful of paying for a product, but no.I wasnt alone in giving up my monthly glossies. Marie Claire has recently too joined the ranks of the digital first, that publishing half le of having no print edition.The internet has everything the mags offered: online magazines cover feminism, beauty vloggers deal with lipstick and food websites cover cookery.What the web lacks is scrutiny. Magazines had teams of fact checkers. Editors had accountability - think of the backlash against skinny models that saw the glossies called to explain themselves to politicians.Theres no road back now for the web only publications but lets hope we dont regret what comes to fill their place."},{"url":null,"title":"loss-cash-machines-affects-decisions-whether-eat","story":"You may wonder what all the fuss is about when it comes to a cashless society.

The result has meant that, on large, the trend has been away from cash as those who are willing, able and technically savvy embrace this.But for the , pensioners in Scotland living in poverty, the many thousands more just above this threshold, the half million over s who do not use the internet, those with disabilities or have a cognitive impairment it is not that easy.If you are over the age of , you are much more likely to be targeted for scams, so itrsquos important that the option for a face-to-face conversation about their finances is available. Indeed, banks should be future proofing their facilities such as branches and cash machines ensuring theyrsquore age and dementia friendly in order to not alienate our ageing population.There are signicant parts of Scotland where cash is king. Not least in the rural economy where the only option for people to withdraw cash is through a fee charging cash machine. There have also been well documented examples of free cash machines in the Highlands, where it is the last machine in town, running dry during the peak tourist season.Poor mobility and a lack of public transport can make it even harder for older people. Many are left with no choice but to pay extortionate fees of up to pound. for pay-to-use cash machines. This will have the biggest impact on those who can least afford it and donrsquot have the option of driving to the nearest free machine.With the equivalent of  free to use cash machines disappearing from Scottish communities each month it can feel that we are being bounced into accepting the switch away from cash.But it is not just cash machine access which is vanishing. Bank branches have been closing at alarming rate throughout Scotland despite repeated complaints from customers, politicians, and organisations such as Age Scotland. For context, wersquore talking about nearly , branches being closed across the UK over the last  years. In Scotland, there are now a third fewer bank branches in our communities than there were in .:Poorest Scots hit hardest by cash machine exodus as more than one a day is axedA caller to Age Scotlandrsquos freephone helpline, which provides information, friendship, and advice, told us that after forgetting her account password, a telephone advisor told her she would have to ldquopop in to her nearest branch. The only problem was that she lived in rural Perthshire and the closest one involved a journey of almost two hours on two dferent buses!Bank closures coupled with the removal of free to use cash machines will see older peoplersquos choice severely limited as to how they choose to manage their finances. We know that many older people, particularly those on low and fixed incomes prefer to use cash as a means of effective budgeting. Restricting their ability to access cash, not to mention free access, is having a negative impact on their day to day lives.There are towns in Scotland where there are no banks whatsoever. Lochgelly in Fe is one. Dornoch in the Highlands another. It is likely that this will keep happening, creating banking deserts unless action is taken.This is why, just last month, Age Scotland joined calls from the House of Commonsrsquo Scottish Affairs Committee and others to seek a commitment from banks that they will not close the last bank in town. If that is not forthcoming then the option of legislation to stop them doing so could become a very real prospect.One solution to prevent these banking deserts could very well be an idea Age Scotland, and some politicians, have been promoting. Joint bank branches, or a shared banking hub, would see banks sharing a physical space to keep a high street or community presence. This would mean that people can interact with staff face-to-face, discuss their banking needs and find out more about improving their financial health.The idea of Shared Banking Hubs in smaller communities where there is less footfall is gaining support from older people and politicians. Most recently the UK Parliamentrsquos Treasury Committee recommended that shared Bank Branch facilities should be considered in their inquiry on Consumersrsquo access to financial services.We have also had discussions with one bank who are interested in the idea, but it still requires others to join in and trial this.We are not against the proleration of convenient digital banking options. It works brilliantly for many older people who have access to technology and choose to do so, but we cannot just brush aside the needs of those it does not suit.Itrsquos not progress when the poorest and most vulnerable are left behind, which is exactly what is happening and why organisations like Age Scotland will campaign relentlessly to ensure that no one is financially excluded."},{"url":null,"title":"royals-urged-turn-palace-holyrood-annexe-yes-vote","story":"On the fth anniversary of the  referendum, Green Andy Wightman said the monarchy should relinquish any

But since that politician is her, between  and now, I imagine she can.Even so, her partyrsquos current position may, in political terms, be their best bet since, despite the previous range of opinion in both parties, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson are the party of Brexit come hell or high water while Labour under Jeremy Corbyn have become, well, frankly, anyonersquos guess.Indeed, itrsquos mystying that the Lib Dems have not hoovered up more of the remain vote which was, after all,  per cent of the result. Yet polling has them at about  per cent . Being the Stop Brexit Party may be neither liberal nor democratic and, despite the impression given by Holyrood, Westminster, social and mainstream media, may even still be a minority view, but itrsquos certainly the one that ought to maximise the Lib Dem vote.The principal argument against it is that it wonrsquot happen, or as Niall Hodson, a brave dissenting delegate at the party conference, put it, lead to the Lib Dems ldquopromising something and doing something .The reason is that there is no prospect that the party will be the largest one at the next election, and Ms Swinson has already ruled out a coalition with either the Tories or Labour ndash something that this particular policy would, in any case, make extremely dficult.Itrsquos also an interesting inversion of the partyrsquos position in relation to the SNP, which criticised the Lib Dems for arguing against a second independence referendum, eventhe Nationalists geta majority of Scottish seats.Interesting because it seems reasonable to claim that, were the Lib Dems to win a majority of UK seats, that would look like a mandate to halt Brexit, while itrsquos highly contentious to claim that an SNP majority at either Holyrood or in Scottish Westminster seats automatically indicates a preference for independence, or even a second go at a referendum. Thatrsquos because the SNP are Scotlandrsquos Lib Dems.Of course, both parties have their true believers, who wholeheartedly support their respective policies. You can tell thatrsquos true, because they do so even when the policies are the polar opposite of what they were a decade ago. But both also attract support from people who canrsquot bring themselves to vote Conservative or Labour at any given moment. Particularly because lots of people who formerly supported one of the two largest parties wonrsquot, in any circumstances, vote for the other. Naturally, that goes double for defecting MPs, who almost all, Tory or Labour, discover theyrsquove secretly been Liberal Democrats all along.But the electoral arithmetic translates the SNP voteinto majorities and real power. It doesnrsquot do the same for the Lib Dems ndash one reason why they are, reasonably enough, obsessed by the mechanics of the electoral system ndash except in by-elections, where they are famously dirty and successful campaigners.In Scotland, the anti-Brexitvote is SNP, unless the other Union is an even greater priority. But itrsquos not clear where the Lib Dems can make major gains in England and Wales, even though there should, one would think, be loads of people bursting to vote for them. Many key swing seats are straight Tory Labour marginals, while the traditional Lib Dem heartland of the South West of England is, oddly enough, a Leave-voting area.Voters who want above all to stop Brexit will, and indeed probably should, vote Lib Dem. In England, it may be their only option. If they believe in other Lib Dem policies, or at least prefer them to Tory and Labour ones, thatrsquos a bonus.

The timing could not have been better.We were days away from implementing a strategic decision to extend both The Herald and sister title The National across seven days. For The Herald brand, there had been confusion in the market place, including online, over an apolitical editorial stance Monday to Saturday and a left-wing, independence supporting Sunday Herald.The National championed an independent Scotland and catered for a market committed to that cause, but did not have a Sunday offering. Readers turned instead to The Sunday Herald but many Monday to Saturday Herald readers were alienated by The Sunday Heraldrsquos political stance. That impacted on sales and our online audiences.The solution was to rebrand The Sunday Herald and launch a Sunday National to cater for an independence-supporting audience seven days, and to produce a Herald on Sunday fully aligned with the political stance and values of Monday to Saturdayrsquos Herald.A unique marketing opportunity beckoned.A Bafta winner I had a positive response to allowing the cameras in when, as Editor of The Sunday Post, we celebrated its centenary, and the experience of others in the spotlight, such as Glasgow Central Station and Edinburgh Airport, shows that providing the public with a unique insight helps provide a welcome understanding of our roles, responsibilities and challenges.However, it was important for our brands, The Herald, Evening Times and The National, to ensure that the production company had a track record of excellent work.Documentary producer director Sarah Howitt made the first series of ldquoScotlandrsquos Superhospital ndash following the move to the new hospital and more recently The Force: The Story of Scotlandrsquos police, which was nominated for a Scottish Bafta for Best Factual Series and for a Royal Television Society award for the same.Maurice and Sarah first worked together in  on a documentary entitled The Bridge: Fty Years Across The Forth, which won the Bafta Scotland best single documentary in .

Again, in the same way, we ask our public to trust our journalists to be fair and balanced, there is an expectation of the same from the BBC.So in rolled the camerashellip but for much longer than expected. More of that later.: Jeane Freeman announces public inquiry into building flaws at QEUH and Edinburgh Sick KidsTrust, credibility andfake newsSadly, despite our remarkable -year history, The Herald is not immune from the same criticism levelled at all mediandashthat we produce fake news, suppress and distort the truth. We are the worldrsquos longest-running national newspaper, but that counts for little amongst the online trolls who only want an echo chamber fort views.Our critics often use it as to beat us with. What better opportunity to show our integrity, balance, fairness and lack of bias.In addition, like most journalists, nothing irritates me more than seeing our profession and industry portrayed in dramas, soap and films as insensitive, intrusive and reckless with the truth.I am sure when you sit down to enjoy the shows you will see professional, dedicated and caring staff interested only in their audiences quality journalism.The Herald is staunchly apolitical. Importantly, audiences will see how wrong accusations of any political bias are. We represent all views and have brilliant columnists ndash given complete freedom to express their opinions.Insight and understandingThe news industry is challenged by growing digital consumption and declining print readership. We reach record overall audiences and are getting ever closer to the point where digital revenues and growing commercial partnerships exceed the more traditional revenue s in print. As we make that seismic transition, we need to manage our costs to allow us to continue to invest in the multi-media offering that will protect our long-term futureQuality journalism, be it in print or online, is expensive. Balancing that equation means streamlining processes, increasing efficiencies, structural changes and dficult conversations. The cameras were there to capture it all ndash painful though it was.Almost every industry has its own challenges and as journalists, we report without fear or favour. For viewers to have trust in us and our brand to have credibility it was important to be open and honest. Our readers will have a better insight and understanding of the complexities and dficulties of delivering quality content across many s and see that our commitment remains as strong as ever.Brexit madnessThe documentary features our comprehensive coverage of Brexit, free of any partisan agenda, and delivered for a Scottish audience.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December . SSEN has said this means, in turn, that the construction of the transmission link may be delayed for at least a two-year period,the full time is required to secure the MW target, or shorterthe need is met at an earlier stage.SSEN’s Transmission and Distribution businesses now intend to consult with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to help establish the optimal #whole system# solution in an effort to make the most of Orkney’s renewable potential.Talking about Ofgem#s decision, Rob McDonald, managing director for transmission with SSEN, said: “Whilst we are clearly disappointed with today’s decision, our commitment to work with Orkney developers and other stakeholders to unlock Orkney’s vast renewable potential has not changed.“With both the UK and Scottish Government committed to net zero emissions, we firmly believe Orkney and Scotland’s other two major island groups will have a key role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change.“We now look forward to working with developers and other stakeholders on Orkney to collectively explore the best way forward to unlock Orkney’s renewable potential.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Concepts that we now treat as universal, and take for granted, such as the essential dignity of le, innate human rights, and the need to care for others less fortunate than ourselves, are widely held only because they derive from Christian teaching.Despite the sophistication of their societies, and their interest in philosophy, the ancient Greeks and Romans had no belief in notions such as equality under the law. These were, after all, civilisations built on conquest and slavery. It was only with the coming of Christianity that attitudes started to change.When the Apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians, “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus”, this was a revolutionary statement of Earth-shattering proportions. Never before had the world heard a message that everyone was to be treated equally never before had any religion been open to all, regardless of race, sex, or place in society.: Ruth Davidson: I was ‘hopelessly conflicted’ as Scots Tory leaderFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereValues that we hold in common today, whether Christian or not, such as the need to care for the less fortunate, to “love our neighbour as ourselves”, derive directly from Christ’s teachings and Paul’s letters. Along with this goes a warning against excess, a need for sobriety and self-control.Paul wrote to the citizens of Philippi: “Let your moderation be known unto all men.” This particular thought is not necessarily a Christian one. The saying “Observe due measure moderation is best in all things” is attributed to the Greek poet Hesiod from around BC. But whether its roots are Greek or Christian, it is a sentiment as relevant today as it was centuries ago.We are in an era when it looks asthe common ground in politics is being deserted. Everywhere we see a drive to extremes, with a rise in identity politics. Increasingly voters are in camps, either Leavers or Remainers, unionists or nationalists, left or right, with little space for subtlety in between. It is the easiest thing in the world for a politician to plant a flag and say “Here I stand, no surrender!” to dismiss, even ignore, the arguments of others and to refuse to countenance any compromise. This unwillingness to bend, to show grace, and to see the other argument, blights our politics and ides our society.: Brexit: It’s time to stop this dangerous madness now – Christine Jardine: How Supreme Court judgement on suspension of parliament could undermine the UK – Ian SwansonHistory recognises as truly great figures not those who dug themselves into trenches, but those who were prepared to reach out across the ides. Whether it is figures like Nelson Mandela, David Trimble or even Martin McGuinness, leaders who were prepared to climb down from the barricades and extend the hand of friendship to those who were once bitter enemies are types of the role models that we need today.This is not a plea for the abandonment of principle or strongly held positions which are supported by evidence. Rather it is a recognition that the greatest advances we make as society are achieved when we are at least prepared to consider the other point of view.In , Winston Churchill, then Secretary of State for War and Air, warned of the consequences of the punitive terms in the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed enormous reparations on the defeated Germans. Advocating a policy of reconciliation, he argued that a harsh approach would simply increase the fear and hatred between France and Germany, and would lead to another war.We know today that Churchill was correct. The rise of Hitler could be directly attributed to the treatment of the German nation by the victorious Allies. The history of the th century might well have been very dferent, and much tragedy avoided, had the winners adopted a spirit of forgiveness.A century later, our challenges are very dferent from those of that time, and yet in our febrile debates around Brexit we see something of the spirit of : a digging of trenches, a placing of blame, and a refusal to find common ground.We have had the Prime Minister withdrawing the Conservative whip from  MPs who refused to back his line, and we have had a Liberal Democrat Leader, Jo Swinson, saying that the former Prime Minister David Cameron can never be forgiven for calling a Brexit referendum, despite that having been a Liberal Democrat policy for years. That spirit, on all sides, will not help us find a way forward.It does now look like the Government is very serious, even at this late hour, about finding a new deal with the EU to deliver an orderly Brexit. I sincerely hope that it will be successful. But whatever the terms of any deal, for some it won’t be enough. Those looking to see some political advantage, more interested in promoting conflict than finding common ground, will denounce any deal as imperfect. Words such as ‘traitor’, ‘Quisling’, and ‘collaborator’ will be thrown around.I hope that politicians on all sides will see the need for compromise. The country is heartily sick of the Brexit debate, not least because of the manner in which it has consumed the energy of the entire political class, leaving so little space for other more vital issues to be addressed.We need a new spirit of moderation, of generosity, and of putting the national interest and unity before narrow political considerations, because the alternative is yet more bitterness and ision. Whether Christian or not, our citizens deserve it of their leaders.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"victorian plan for scotland northern ireland bridge may have been a wild ride leader comment","story":"Boris Johnson#s plan for a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland was suggested as long ago as , although passengers on the proposed submerged tubular bridge would have had to be made of stern stuff.The judgement of history upon the Victorians has not been kind. The chronicler of the age, Charles Dickens, even had his name turned into an adjective meaning squalid or poverty-stricken. However, it’s probably fair to say they had the bold self-confidence that, for some people, modern Britain lacks.So it’s not surprising that politicians like Jacob Rees-Mogg have sought to rehabilitate them.His book The Victorians: Twelve Titans who Forged Britain may have been described as “staggeringly silly” by AN Wilson, but surely they must have had some great ideas that could inspire us today.: Book review: The Victorians by AN WilsonFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereTurns out that a proposal for a bridge between Scotland and Ireland – recently suggested by Boris Johnson – was foreshadowed as long ago as .

Mr Cameron says: “It was certainly well covered [by the media], although the words were very limited, I think it helped to put a slightly dferent perception on things.”The revelation again jeopardises the Queens traditional political neutrality - which Mr Cameron had also previously thrown into doubt.In the aftermath of the No victory, he was overheard telling businessman Michael Bloomberg, that the monarch \"purred down the line\" at news of the result. He told Mr Bloomberg: “The definition of relief is being the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and ringing the Queen and saying: ‘It’s alright, it’s OK’. That was something. She purred down the line.”The SNP declined to comment on Mr Camerons latest revelations, with a party source saying they had been \"unfazed\" by the Queens remark at the time, and were now \"focused on the future, not the past\".However, former First Minister, Alex Salmond said: “Begging a constitutional monarch to make a political intervention is not only totally improper but an indication of how desperate Prime Minister Cameron was in the final stages of the Scottish referendum campaign.\"Five years on Scotland should remember that Westminster does not recognise any political rule book. Cameron started the campaign uber-confident and ended up in a blue funk. I doubtScotland will let the establishment off the hook next time around.\"He added: \"As to Cameron’s suggestion that he was successful in securing a royal intervention, I doubt that.\"What I can vouch for is that the week after the referendum I was asked to meet the Queen at Balmoral. We discussed Cameron’s “purring comments” to Michael Bloomberg in New York in the aftermath of the referendum where he again blurted out what he claimed were her private thoughts.\"Unlike David Cameron I will not ulge what she said but suffice to say she was very far from amused at his behaviour.”In his book, For The Record, Mr Cameron has also revealed how on the day of the poll which put the Yes campaign ahead, he had to prepare for an audience with the Queen \"the woman who had reigned over the UK for  years\" while he was \"the man who had allowed a vote on its possible disintegration.\"He wrote: “Of course, she was completely charming — the whole household was. But as Prince Philip showed me the barbecue he had designed to roast grouse and sausages up at the hillside bothy, the referendum was clearly on everyones mind. They gingerly asked questions, but knew they shouldnt express too strong an opinion.“And then, the next day at breakfast, there it was in cold print. Among the kippers and the kedgeree was The Sunday Times, with the headline \"Yes vote leads in Scots poll\".“The Queen wasnt there — she usually had breakfast alone. Instead, I was surrounded by ladies-in-waiting, equerries and the moderator of the Church of Scotland. I tried to reassure them about \"rogue polls\", but I was struggling to convince myself, let alone them.“One week later, however, the Queen spoke to some of those gathered outside Crathie Kirk and said she hoped Scots would \"think very carefully\" about the vote. I was delighted.”His latest revelation comes in the BBC One series, ‘The Cameron Years’, which begins tonight, and which charts the key milestones of his political career, while also hearing from allies and critics who worked closely alongside him.The series also sees George Osborne blame Cameron for feeding the idea \"Brussels was to blame\" for the UKs domestic troubles, and Michael Gove saying he thought Mr Cameron believed their friendship meant he wouldn’t \"stray from the fold\".Mr Osborne also tells the programme he is “very sorry for what happened” and admits he feels “responsible” because of his role of Chancellor of the Exchequer, adding that “we held a referendum we should never have held” and “the consequences for the country are grave.” He says: “I feel very sorry for what happened, and I feel responsible, I was the Chancellor of the Exchequer in that Government, we held a referendum we should never have held, we then lost that referendum and the consequences for the country are grave and the only thing I can plea in my mitigation is that a huge number of people wanted that referendum, and I made a case against it, but it wasn’t heard, and David Cameron was just one of a number of British Prime Ministers who had fed this idea that we were dferent than Europe, that Brussels was to blame and that the public ultimately had to have a say, and we’ve all paid a price for it in my view”.Reacting to Mr Osbornes remarks, Martin Whitfield, Labour MP for East Lothian, said: “The Cameron Osborne government got us into this mess and they must take responsibility for the economic hardship and isions in society they have caused.“Nationalists are always looking for someone  to blame, whether that be Scottish nationalists blaming Westminster, or English nationalists blaming Brussels. We need to build bridges, not erect barriers. “The only way out of this mess is to give the people of the UK the opportunity to remain in the EU.”In the programme both David Cameron and George Osborne also speak openly about the fraught conversations they had in the Downing Street flat, trying to convince Michael Gove to come down on their side.Michael Gove says he felt “some of the conversations we had were attempts on his part to reassure himself that our friendship would mean that I wouldn’t stray from the fold.”Mr Gove says: “I think David understandably felt that since I’d been prepared to knuckle under on a number of occasions beforehand and put my own feelings to one side in order to serve the team, that on this occasion, that I would do the same.”Mr Cameron describes as a “bombshell” the moment when Gove said he would support the Leave campaign.George Osborne remembers the moment he warned Gove “ you go to the Leave campaign you will destroy this Government,we lose this referendum, David Cameron will have to go, there’s no way he’ll be able to survive, and everything we’ve worked on will fall apart.”* The Cameron Years, is on BBC One tonight at pm.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that.

Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people.

Gingham tablecloth, matching curtains, egg and chips on the hob and Tara Lynne O’Neill’s Shirley Valentine invites us into her kitchen.Willy Russell’s iconic play, later a film, has been relocated from s Liverpool to Belfast in this winning new production by Patrick J O’Reilly – the artistic director of Tinderbox Theatre Company.Shirley keeps telling us that she is “ years old”, which doesn’t seem that old at all but the character, at this stage in her le, is already done. She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free. Tara Lynne triumphantly portrays a woman who was a prisoner in her own kitchen but learns that there is “le beyond the walls” and drags us along with her, cheering in her wake.As the lights dim, she’s on the beach and waiting for Joe – who she believes probably won’t recognise her – to come and talk at the crossroads they have found themselves at.In a poignant touch, there was a standing ovation for actor and “hugely talented” assistant director of the production Julie Maxwellwho tragically passed away last month.Shirley Valentine runs at the Lyric Theatre until October .

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from. I want to see all young people succeed in what they are doing.”"},{"url":null,"title":"arlene foster calls for sensible brexit deal","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bpanews_be--e-b-bcecfe_EmailGoogle is teaming up with one the UK’s biggest regional news publishers in a bid to find new ways of making local digital journalism viable in a world dominated by social media..pushThe tech giant is working with Archant, the company behind more than  newspaper titles across the country, on an experimental project that hopes to save local news.It is understood that the partnership involves several million pounds of funding from Google.According to Press Gazette research published earlier this year,  UK local news titles closed in  while  were launched, resulting in a total loss of  titles.New all-digital news s separate from Archant’s existing portfolio will be built, aimed at up to three UK communities.The properties will be % owned and operated by the Norwich-headquartered firm, with support and expertise from the Google News Initiative.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  “We will endeavour over the next three years to launch three new community websites in communities in the UK that have been identied as being under-served by local news, either because the existing news provider has withered away to nothing as has happened in many places or because they’ve never had a good news representation,” said Matt Kelly, chief content officer for Archant.“The idea is to have the luxury to experiment and try to come up with some positive solutions to what is a serious and chronic problem, not just in the UK but further afield, which is the decline of the business model for local news.”Exact staff numbers are yet to be decided, but Mr Kelly said it might be able to support somewhere between  and  employees across the three communities over the three-year period.Results from the project will be shared with other publishers across the globe, in an effort to lead as a “playbook for the rest of the industry”.“In terms of precisely how we’re going to do this, we’ve got some early thoughts – a lot of it will be good old-fashioned people in the community, building relationships and making sure that everything that moves is covered and taking a lead on important community issues,” Mr Kelly continued.The partnership follows a similar project in the US with McClatchy, announced in March.“Local news plays an important part in keeping people informed about their communities and the news they care about,” said Madhav Chinnappa, director of news ecosystem development at Google.“This partnership between Archant and the GNI’s Local Experiments Project aims to put innovation at the heart of a new effort to rethink local news from the ground up for the age of digital.“This is an experiment in the true sense of the word – looking to see what works and what doesn’t, and sharing what we all learn with the wider industry.”"},{"url":null,"title":"john humphrys presents today programme for final time","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures llanfair caereinion celebrates deri woods centenary","story":"Caereinion High School Sixth Form students give a helping hand on the barefoot wltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtalking trail at Deriltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Woods.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

We as a family remember Mark everyday but to know that these young men thought about him often too brings us a great deal of comfort.Mark was the youngest of the family of nine. He showed great promise as a soccer player, playing locally for Ballynahinch Olympic and catching the eye of Norwich City.Well-liked and respected, and much loved, Katie says that her family never realised that Mark was suffering with mental health issues.Katie said: ldquoMark was an extremely engaging young man who got an A in his  plus. We called him the brain box of the family, teasing him about going to the grammar school which after the eight of us, that was quite a novelty.ldquoOur wee manrsquos funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Ballynahinch and held on New Yearrsquos Eve.

He was always laughing and his friends knew him as Quinny. He loved his family and friends.Katie said that Mark was buried in his Olympic strip and his jersey number  was retired by the club shortly afterwards.Ballynahinch Olympic has continued to honour Mark every year at their awards night presenting the Mark Quinn memorial cup to the young player of the year.Katie has also made a plea for those who feel le is a struggle to talk to someone.She said: ldquoIf anyone reading this is struggling, please let someone know. Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament.

In particular, he agreed that whatever economic approach was taken to unication, it would be “problematic”.Mr Birnie told the News Letter last year that NI receives about £bn in net funding annually from the UK exchequer.

There is a tendency for some commentators to assume the UK would continue to subsidise NI, he added. “But is that a realistic assumption ”Last year DUP MP and former finance minister Sammy Wilson said that unication is “not viable” in economic terms.However, it was understood at that time that Dublin had never published a formal feasibility study on the matter. Asked to comment last year by the News Letter, the Irish government declined to offer any comment on a feasibility study.Sinn Fein, however, dismissed the “unaffordability myth” of unication and claimed that the annual UK subvention to NI could be as low as £.billion.But Fianna Fail Senator Mark Daly, who had been leading research into unication, went further, claiming that NI actually “comes close to a balanced budget”.Mr Wilson added: “Sinn Fein’s fantasy figures will convince only themselves. When HM Treasury produces evidence Sinn Fein does not like it is simply dismissed by a party who held the finance department [at Stormont] but could not even produce a budget.”try catch  TrendingU.K.

We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

is encouraging schools here to take advantage of beneficial dog safety and responsible dog ownership lessons for their students. Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be Dog Smart’ visit www.bedogsmart.org.ukFor more information or to book a ‘Be Dog Smart’ workshop, contact Cathy Clyde on    or email cathy.clyde@dogstrust.org.ukFuneral details for Francis McCarville

graduated as a doctor in February this year and has been working at McCabe’s Pharmacy in the Northwood area of Dublin since May.The former St Michael’s Grammar School pupil explained: “The lady came into the shop struggling to breathe, she was in full-blown anaphylactic shock.”Emmett acted quickly and gave the woman an adrenaline shot: “I could see the rash on her neck so I knew she had an allergy.“I thought I’d have to do CPR. I gave her a shot of adrenaline and it didn’t really do anything.“Then I gave her a second adrenaline pen and it seemed to work until the ambulance arrived.“She required two more in the ambulance but from what I’ve heard she seems to be good now, thank God.“I’m also trained as a doctor so I think that certainly helped.”He added: “It’s not the sort of thing you expect to see and I’m glad I was able to help.”Emmett, whose long term ambition is to work in anaesthesia, has been in touch with the lady’s family who expressed their gratitude for his lesaving actions: “Her daughter contacted me and said she couldn’t thank me enough.”Emmett’s family back in Lurgan have expressed their pride in the young doctor’s heroic actions.His aunt Margaret McManus said: “We are very proud of him. He lost his twin brother, Finbar, three years ago and he has worked so hard. His mum dad and granny Eilish and sister Emma are so proud of him.”Emmett said: “My family has been through a tough time, I lost my brother when I was studying for my medical degree, I couldn’t focus on my exams.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us.

The medical teams were incredibly calm, and it was very helpful in such a frightening situation.” Trevor continued, “I was in hospital for five days. I knew it would be traumatic for my two young boys to visit, so we waited a few days before bringing them to the hospital.“I have had surgery on two occasions already with more to follow.“As a joiner this has of course had a massive impact on my livelihood and while I would love nothing more than to be back at work, I’m also aware that it will take some time. “I am very grateful that my limb has been saved and I now want to give something back to this charity as I know it takes £, a day to keep it going.“It was fantastic to be able to visit the air ambulance base recently to meet with the HEMS team who treated me at the scene. I have two sons and they thoroughly enjoyed being able to finish school a bit early for the important visit to the base and see the helicopter and meet the team. “I’m so grateful to them and also to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and all of the other medical professionals who have treated me so far.”Dr Darren Monaghan said: “It was great for the team to be able to welcome Trevor and his family to the base. Trevor’s story is a prime example of how important it is to be able to provide early clinical intervention and le and limb saving medical treatment at the scene.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.

Trade NI – the new alliance between Hospitality Ulster, Manufacturing NI and Retail NI – is unveiling a -year plan called ‘Vision ’ at a Westminster reception on Wednesday afternoon, as the UK’s political system enters its most volatile period in a generation. With just weeks before the UK is expected to leave the EU, more than  guests are confirmed to attend the event that will be addressed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith MP and the shadow Secretary of State, Tony Lloyd MP. Business leaders are also due to attend a later event at Downing Street, and a lunch at the Irish Embassy. Trade NI’s “transformative economic plan” will set out key policy priorities that have the potential to create , jobs and to make Northern Ireland a high growth economy. In a joint statement, Trade NIs Colin Neill , Stephen Kellyand Glyn Roberts , said: “Northern Ireland is facing a huge challenge as it struggles politically and economically with a growth forecast of around % or below. This is simply not good enough and we can’t sit idly by and let events overtake us. We must break the cycle of limited economic growth.” “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “We need to be bold and ambitious about creating % or even % growth over the next few years, but that requires decision makers to be pressed into action and a series of policy and legislative decisions to be taken and driven through. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer.” “Our Vision  document sets out a bold new ten-year plan for creating , new jobs and creating a high growth economy. We want to make Northern Ireland the best place in the UK and Ireland to shop, socialise, locate and start a business “The Vision  plan sets out to create a better ing business environment and attract further inward investment that will lead to a revitalised economy taking on the challenge in turbulent times.” “We want to make Northern Ireland an eco-system of innovation.Trade NI is keen to work with all business organisations, chambers of commerce, trade unions and voluntary sector representation to create a new progressive partnership for change in Northern Ireland.” And Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, sponsor of Trade NI’s Westminster reception, said: Danske Bank is proud to be one of the main sponsors of Trade NI’s Westminster reception. Trade NI is seizing the initiative and ensuring that the voice of the local business community is being heard loud and clear at a time of upheaval and uncertainty.” “The vibrancy of the Northern Ireland private sector is imperative to the strength of our economy and we need to ensure that local businesses are protected and well positioned to be able to compete globally in the post-Brexit environment.” Emma Gilthorpe, executive director, Heathrow Expansion, said: “Heathrow is delighted to support the launch of Trade NI, echoing Heathrow’s commitment to connect Northern Ireland to global growth and to share the benefits of an expanded Heathrow with the businesses and communities of Northern Ireland.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/dm11.jpg","title":"tech entrepreneur named catalysts innovation founder","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by Ulster Business A top tech entrepreneur has been named as Catalyst’s Innovation Founder for  by a  of leading judges.
