I\u0027ve seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I don\u0027t like the one I\u0027m seeing now.

The, I guess, liaison with the royal family never answers back, and there\u0027s no address I can write to, so I have no way of contacting my daughter,\u0027 the ex-Hollywood lighting director said.\u0027My message (to her) would be, I love you, I miss you, I\u0027m sorry for anything that went wrong.

The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

My whole holiday is ruined with 1 week to go to go and I can\u0027t get hold of a real person to speak to!!!\u0027Another said: \u0027Ryanair, cancelled flight due to strike, however can\u0027t get in contact with them. No answering of phone, chat, online customer service.\u0027          However scores of travellers took to social media complaining that there holiday plans had been ruined, and complained they were struggling to get hold of Ryanair to rebook flights.Unions in all four countries are asking that Ryanair staff be employed according to the national legislation of the country they operate in, rather than that of Ireland as is currently the case.They also want the airline to give contractors the same work conditions as its own employees.Ryanair\u0027s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said in a statement: \u0027These strikes are entirely unjustified and will achieve nothing other than to disrupt family holidays, and benefit competitor airlines in Belgium, Portugal and Spain.\u0027His statement added: \u0027Ryanair cabin crew enjoy great pay - up to 40,000 euros (£36,000) p.a. (in countries with high youth unemployment) - industry leading rosters (14 days off each month), great sales commissions, uniform allowances and sick pay.\u0027The European cabin crew strike follows on from separate industrial action by Ryanair\u0027s Irish-based pilots.      A tweet posted by Ryanair yesterday announcing the disruption that they said will affect up to 50,000 customers. They also posted a note detailing the conditions its staff work under, calling it \u0027Ryanair cabin crew - the facts\u0027On Wednesday, the airline confirmed it had to cancel 24 flights between Ireland and the UK, affecting 4,000 passengers, scheduled for tomorrow due to the pilots\u0027 strike.The walkout marks the second strike by Irish pilots\u0027 union Forsa after it staged a 24 hour walk out last week.Thirty Ryanair flights were cancelled last Thursday, affecting some 5,000 passengers, after the pilots staged their first strike over pay and their conditions of employment.After Friday\u0027s strike a third 24-hour walk-out is planned for next Tuesday.The airline, which is Europe\u0027s biggest budget carrier averted widespread strikes before last Christmas by deciding to recognise trade unions for the first time in its 32-year history, but has since struggled to reach agreement on terms in some countries.Ryanair, which flies in 37 countries and carried 130 million passengers last year, has so far signed agreements with pilots in Italy and Britain, two of its largest markets, but also experienced minor disruption in Germany and Portugal."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/16/4E6820D500000578-0-image-m-25_1532012718097.jpg","title":"UK holidaymakers pay 5 50 permit drive EU Brexit","story":"    At the moment, British motorists can drive in the EU under their normal licences - but there is as yet no deal to keep mutual recognition in place.

An inquest ruled that Ms Peebles\u0027s death was accidentalHe said: \u0027She wouldn\u0027t answer at all. That\u0027s when I really started to worry. I went back to my friend\u0027s house. I couldn\u0027t sleep so I left in the morning.\u0027I walked past the station and there were lots of ambulances outside.\u0027I was worried, so I went to her house and looked in her bedroom window on the ground floor. But she was not there.\u0027Mr Wilson received a call from one of his friends telling him it was his girlfriend\u0027s body that had been found near the railway station.Along with another of her friends, Mr Wilson went back to Ms Peebles\u0027 house and broke the news to her mother, Hayley Peebles.A friend Hannah Brooker said Ms Peebles had been emotional during the evening and at one point told her she \u0027felt like she had no one\u0027.Ms Brooker reassured her this was not true and said she put her mood down to alcohol and others noted she had seemed \u0027jolly\u0027.Her mother was adamant Ms Peebles would not have taken her own life.\u0027That would never even cross my mind,\u0027 she said.\u0027She used to get emotional when she got drunk but that\u0027s true of the majority of people.\u0027The post-mortem suggested Ms Peebles had been electrocuted after touching a live rail shortly after she got off the train and would have died instantly.Toxicology tests also found she had a blood alcohol level around twice that of the legal drink drive limit.While she had suffered some burns and other injuries to the head and body, there was nothing to suggest she had been assaulted.Assistant coroner Ian Goldup ruled the death to be accidental.He said: \u0027Her telephone calls to her friends indicate she was lost and unable to help herself.\u0027The coroner stated he will be writing to Network Rail suggesting action be taken to prevent others from dying as Taiyah did.Mrs Peebles said she wants to see railway stations made safer following her daughter\u0027s tragic death          Friends of Ms Peebles have painted a mural in tribute for the tragic teenagerSpeaking in tribute to her daughter, Mrs Peebles said: \u0027She was a law unto herself.

She loved spending time with her sisters and nieces.\u0027She lived every day of her life like it was the last.\u0027While barriers have since been put up at Herne Bay station, Mrs Peebles said this is not enough and she wants stations across the country to be made safer.She continued: \u0027I am just flabbergasted at the amount of deaths which have happened on the railway and nothing is done. \u0027It seems it does not matter how many lives they take nothing is done.\u0027They are just another statistic. I am not going to let Taiyah become just another statistic.\u0027Speaking after the inquest, she said: \u0027I am now on a mission to get all the train stations made safe so no one will have to go through what I have.\u0027We would like to make children and young adults aware of the dangers of railways.

Sir Cliff Richard won a landmark case against the BBC yesterday, but a judge\u0027s suggestions that naming someone under investigation is unlawful have led to fears over freedom of the pressMr Stephens added: \u0027I know Sir Cliff has said he would rather 10 guilty people go free than one ­innocent person suffer but it is in the public interest that 10 guilty people are caught, even if we have to inconvenience one innocent person.\u0027 TV and radio personality Stuart Hall was jailed for indecently assaulting 13 girls aged between nine and 17 after reports of the investigation led to more victims coming forward.Similarly, the identification of Max Clifford led to more victims going to police before the PR guru was jailed for indecent assaults on girls and young women.Campaigners for transparency have also said that more victims of Jimmy Savile may have come forward had his questioning by Surrey Police been made public in 2009.      Yesterday\u0027s legal ruling centred on a report the BBC broadcast from outside Sir Cliff\u0027s mansion as police raided it as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assaultConcerns over the impact of the Cliff Richard judgment were echoed in an email sent to BBC staff by the corporation\u0027s Head of News today.Fran Unsworth stated: \u0027Although the judge found against us, he was clear that what we broadcast was accurate and as I said outside the courtroom, I believe all our journalists acted in good faith.\u0027There\u0027s a significant principle at stake as well - one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC.  Fran Unsworth, Head of BBC News, wrote in an email to staff today that it is not in the public interest for suspects to stay secret\u0027If this ruling stands, it changes the way in which all journalists will have to approach naming the subject of a criminal investigation.\u0027It effectively would make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named, unless the police do so. And I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s in the public interest.\u0027Within hours of the Cliff Richard ruling, the Prime Minister was asked in the Commons whether a \u0027Cliff\u0027s Law\u0027 should be introduced.This would ban the media from naming a person before they are charged, except in exceptional circumstances.Theresa May told MPs that she believed there were cases where naming the accused before they are charged \u0027enables other victims to come forward and therefore strengthens the case against an inidual\u0027. Sir Cliff had sued the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014, following a child sex assault allegation.The singer said coverage, which involved the use of a helicopter, was a \u0027very serious invasion\u0027 of his privacy, and he said he wanted damages at the \u0027top end\u0027 of the scale.          Sir Cliff with his lawyer Gideon Benaim outside the High Court in London today\u0027He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle.\u0027Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law, Sir Cliff\u0027s motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what.\u0027His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through.\u0027What Sir Cliff wanted was for the BBC to acknowledge that what it had done to him was unlawful. Before litigation commenced we asked the BBC to accept this and to apologise.\u0027Sir Cliff would have been reasonable in relation to damages had they agreed to do so. Not only did they refuse to apologise but they were defiant, repeatedly telling the world that this was public interest journalism, when it was not. They even submitted the story for an award, which the Judge found to be an aggravating factor.          Speaking  outside court, Sir Cliff said it would take time to get over \u0027the emotional factor\u0027\u0027The Judge came to the clear conclusion that Sir Cliff\u0027s privacy rights were not outweighed by the BBC\u0027s right to freedom of expression, and, that there did not exist a public interest in identifying him.\u0027Given the adverse findings of fact by the Judge, serious questions ought to be asked about the BBC\u0027s focus on preserving their exclusive story at the expense of Sir Cliff\u0027s rights, as well as how the BBC came to advance such a factual case, including to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2014.\u0027Additionally, whether senior executives exercised sufficient scrutiny over the activities of their journalist, and in approving and signing the BBC\u0027s Defence.\u0027We welcome today\u0027s Judgment, and Sir Cliff would like to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has supported him throughout, his family, friends and of course his fans. It has meant a huge deal to him.

The Jewish state.\u0027\u0027Lately, there are people who are trying to destabilize this and therefore destabilize the foundations of our existence and our rights,\u0027 he added. \u0027So today we have made a law in stone. This is our country. This is our language. This is our anthem and this is our flag. Long live the state of Israel.\u0027Israel\u0027s 1948 declaration of independence defined its nature as a Jewish and democratic state, a delicate balance the country has grappled to maintain for 70 years.Opponents of the new bill say it marginalizes the country\u0027s Arab minority of around 20 per cent and also downgrades Arabic language from official to \u0027special\u0027 standing.The law passed with a 62-55 backing, with two members of the Knesset abstaining.

Opponents of the new bill say it marginalizes the country\u0027s Arab minority of around 20 per cent. Pictured: Israelis wave national flags outside the Old City\u0027s Damascus Gate in Jerusalem in MayEugene Kontorovich, international law director at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Jerusalem think tank, defended the bill, arguing it \u0027is similar to provisions in many Western democratic constitutions, which provide for an official language and national character that reflects the majority of the population.\u0027Kontorovich dismissed the \u0027faux outrage\u0027 against the bill as \u0027simply another attempt to single-out the Jewish state and hold her to a double standard.\u0027American Jewish organizations also expressed their disapproval of the law.The American Jewish Committee, a group representing the Jewish Diaspora, said it was \u0027deeply disappointed,\u0027 adding that the law \u0027puts at risk the commitment of Israel\u0027s founders to build a country that is both Jewish and democratic.\u0027Jeremy Ben Ami, president of J Street, a Washington liberal pro-Israel group, said the bill\u0027s purpose is \u0027to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens.\u0027\u0027Strong connection between Israel and Jews worldwide is based on these values that Israel is both a Jewish and democratic state,\u0027 Ben Ami said, adding concerns the bill would \u0027weaken the strength of Israel\u0027s democracy.\u0027Lawmakers had removed the most contentious clause of the bill on Sunday which would have allowed the establishment of \u0027separate communities\u0027 and which critics had called racist.Israelis, including President Reuven Rivlin and attorney general, voiced opposition to the earlier draft of the bill.

They were implemented to replace chimneys and reduce pollution. Most of the steam is produced at a Con Edison plant on East 14th Street.  The plant exploded during Hurricane Sandy, bringing the network to a halt. In total, there are six plants across the five boroughs which produce the co-generated steam to heat and cool the city. They are located at East 74th Street on the Upper East Side, East 60th Street at Sutton Place, 59th Street and 11th Avenue in Midtown West, Brooklyn\u0027s Navy Yard and Ravenswood in Queens. In Manhattan, it runs from the Battery to 96th Street on the West Side and from downtown to 89th Street on the East Side.It services buildings including Grand Central Terminal, the United Nations and the Empire State Building. In 2007, a pipe which served Grand Central exploded on 41st street in Midtown. It caused multiple injuries and one death.           A diagram of Manhattan\u0027s steam system which shows how it services the city                          The explosion shut down traffic on the busy avenue between 20th and 23rd street and also wreaked havoc on the subway system.Manhattan\u0027s network of steam pipes is unlike many in the world. They are easily spotted on ground level by the orange and white pillars which funnel steam from underground into the air in a controlled way and prevent pressure from building to a breaking point. The network of pipes is more than 100miles long and service nearly 2,000 buildings in the city.Explosions are unusual and rarely deadly. In 2007, a man died from a heart attack after a pipe beneath Grand Central Station exploded and sent a 40ft wall of steam and debris in the air on 41st Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown.           The smoke and steam which rose from the explosion were still visible an hour afterwards           From some angles, the steam shrouded the iconic Empire State Building and cast a dark cloud over the previously bright and clear street WCBS Newsradio 880 on Twitter: \u0026quot\u0026quotThere was just this absolute crazy, loud sound,\u0026quot witness says, describing the steam pipe explosion in the #FlatironDistrict. https:t.coCmFVIMqdRD… https:t.co0MWNn5uA5e\u0026quot"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/12/4E65395700000578-0-image-m-16_1531998281736.jpg","title":"Shocking moment lorry driver takes hands wheel 13 ton truck","story":"    This lorry driver was filmed by police taking both hands off the steering wheel          This driver can be clearly seen with both hands off the steering wheel           Officers also saw this van driver with both hands off the steering wheel on the A338 in DorsetBut hunger got the better of him and he couldn\u0027t resist tucking into his lunch without stopping.He was one of several drivers caught flouting the law as they drove along the A338 in Bournemouth, Dorset.Other offenders included a van driver using both hands to refill his vape device - despite there being a passenger next to him who could have safely done it.Sergeant Mark Farrow, of Dorset Police, said: \u0027As an officer who deals with the often tragic aftermath when a driver is distracted at the wheel, I would like to make a personal plea to the driving public who think it is OK to use a mobile phone while driving to seriously consider their actions.\u0027Nothing is more important than your safety and the safety of other road users and, while you think you can get away with it, it is vital that drivers realise they could kill someone.\u0027We are urging drivers to take responsibility for their actions and leave their phone alone.\u0027          This van driver appears to be holding a mobile phone while behind the wheel          The driver does not appear to have both of his hands on the steering wheel of his vanIt is illegal to hold and use a phone while driving.

Yesterday\u0027s legal ruling centred on a report the BBC broadcast from outside Sir Cliff\u0027s mansion as police raided it as part of an investigation into an alleged sexual assaultConcerns over the impact of the Cliff Richard judgment were echoed in an email sent to BBC staff by the corporation\u0027s Head of News today.Fran Unsworth stated: \u0027Although the judge found against us, he was clear that what we broadcast was accurate and as I said outside the courtroom, I believe all our journalists acted in good faith.\u0027There\u0027s a significant principle at stake as well - one that affects all media organisations, not just the BBC.  Fran Unsworth, Head of BBC News, wrote in an email to staff today that it is not in the public interest for suspects to stay secret\u0027If this ruling stands, it changes the way in which all journalists will have to approach naming the subject of a criminal investigation.\u0027It effectively would make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named, unless the police do so. And I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s in the public interest.\u0027Within hours of the Cliff Richard ruling, the Prime Minister was asked in the Commons whether a \u0027Cliff\u0027s Law\u0027 should be introduced.This would ban the media from naming a person before they are charged, except in exceptional circumstances.Theresa May told MPs that she believed there were cases where naming the accused before they are charged \u0027enables other victims to come forward and therefore strengthens the case against an inidual\u0027. Sir Cliff had sued the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014, following a child sex assault allegation.The singer said coverage, which involved the use of a helicopter, was a \u0027very serious invasion\u0027 of his privacy, and he said he wanted damages at the \u0027top end\u0027 of the scale.          Sir Cliff with his lawyer Gideon Benaim outside the High Court in London today\u0027He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle.\u0027Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law, Sir Cliff\u0027s motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what.\u0027His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through.\u0027What Sir Cliff wanted was for the BBC to acknowledge that what it had done to him was unlawful. Before litigation commenced we asked the BBC to accept this and to apologise.\u0027Sir Cliff would have been reasonable in relation to damages had they agreed to do so. Not only did they refuse to apologise but they were defiant, repeatedly telling the world that this was public interest journalism, when it was not. They even submitted the story for an award, which the Judge found to be an aggravating factor.          Speaking  outside court, Sir Cliff said it would take time to get over \u0027the emotional factor\u0027\u0027The Judge came to the clear conclusion that Sir Cliff\u0027s privacy rights were not outweighed by the BBC\u0027s right to freedom of expression, and, that there did not exist a public interest in identifying him.\u0027Given the adverse findings of fact by the Judge, serious questions ought to be asked about the BBC\u0027s focus on preserving their exclusive story at the expense of Sir Cliff\u0027s rights, as well as how the BBC came to advance such a factual case, including to the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2014.\u0027Additionally, whether senior executives exercised sufficient scrutiny over the activities of their journalist, and in approving and signing the BBC\u0027s Defence.\u0027We welcome today\u0027s Judgment, and Sir Cliff would like to wholeheartedly thank everyone who has supported him throughout, his family, friends and of course his fans. It has meant a huge deal to him. Thank you.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/18/4E689F1000000578-5970245-image-a-27_1532020361422.jpg","title":"Steam pipe explosion rush hour Manhattan","story":"The explosion left a huge crater in the middle of Fifth Avenue between 21st and 22nd street where smoke and steam billowed from the ground and enormous pools of water formed at 6.40am on Thursday.

They were implemented to replace chimneys and reduce pollution. Most of the steam is produced at a Con Edison plant on East 14th Street.  The plant exploded during Hurricane Sandy, bringing the network to a halt. In total, there are six plants across the five boroughs which produce the co-generated steam to heat and cool the city. They are located at East 74th Street on the Upper East Side, East 60th Street at Sutton Place, 59th Street and 11th Avenue in Midtown West, Brooklyn\u0027s Navy Yard and Ravenswood in Queens. In Manhattan, it runs from the Battery to 96th Street on the West Side and from downtown to 89th Street on the East Side.It services buildings including Grand Central Terminal, the United Nations and the Empire State Building. In 2007, a pipe which served Grand Central exploded on 41st street in Midtown. It caused multiple injuries and one death.           A diagram of Manhattan\u0027s steam system which shows how it services the city                          The explosion shut down traffic on the busy avenue between 20th and 23rd street and also wreaked havoc on the subway system.Manhattan\u0027s network of steam pipes is unlike many in the world. They are easily spotted on ground level by the orange and white pillars which funnel steam from underground into the air in a controlled way and prevent pressure from building to a breaking point. The network of pipes is more than 100miles long and service nearly 2,000 buildings in the city.Explosions are unusual and rarely deadly. In 2007, a man died from a heart attack after a pipe beneath Grand Central Station exploded and sent a 40ft wall of steam and debris in the air on 41st Street and Lexington Avenue in Midtown.           The smoke and steam which rose from the explosion were still visible an hour afterwards           From some angles, the steam shrouded the iconic Empire State Building and cast a dark cloud over the previously bright and clear street WCBS Newsradio 880 on Twitter: \u0026quot\u0026quotThere was just this absolute crazy, loud sound,\u0026quot witness says, describing the steam pipe explosion in the #FlatironDistrict. https:t.coCmFVIMqdRD… https:t.co0MWNn5uA5e\u0026quot"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/00/4E63671A00000578-0-image-a-8_1531955629916.jpg","title":"Britains biggest buy let landlord kicks four single mothers properties","story":"    Landlord Fergus Wilson, pictured, has evicted four single mothers with newborn children and vowed to kick out any single woman who falls pregnant in one of his propertiesOne of Britain\u0027s biggest landlords could face legal action after kicking out four single mothers with newborn children.   Fergus Wilson, 69, has blamed \u0027strict\u0027 council rules for his decision, claiming he would face a hefty fine if he failed to fix faulty heating systems within four days in homes where a baby lives, and he has vowed to evict any single women who fall pregnant while living at one of his properties.The 69-year-old multi-millionaire, who is one of the UK\u0027s largest buy-to-let investors along with wife Judith, owns hundreds of properties in Ashford and Maidstone in Kent.Last year, Mr Wilson sparked a row after trying to ban \u0027coloured tenants\u0027 because of the \u0027curry smell\u0027 left in the homes when they left, only to be taken to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission resulting in him being handed a three-year injunction preventing him from discriminating against tenants on racial grounds.Now the same commission has confirmed it will take action on behalf of single mothers.A spokesperson said: \u0027We are taking action against Mr Wilson in view of his clearly discriminatory practice against single mothers. \u0027We encourage anyone affected by Mr Wilson’s practice to contact us.\u0027 Speaking this week, Mr Wilson said the decision was \u0027heartbreaking\u0027 and that the women were \u0027model tenants\u0027 but the enforcement rules were \u0027too strict\u0027.   Police should brace for a surge of hate crimes when leaving...Students paint over Rudyard Kipling poem \u0027If\u0027 just a WEEK...Share this articleThis week Mr Wilson said he has already ended the tenancies of four single mothers with newborn kids - and added he will evict single women who get pregnant.Mr Wilson said he is \u0027not the bad guy\u0027  and claims the rules of Ashford Borough Council forced his hand.Mr Wilson said that the council\u0027s new policy on landlords having to fix boilers \u0027within four days\u0027 if the tenant is a single mum with a baby, were too restrictive\u0027 and that he couldn\u0027t always get a plumber round within the four day period.Landlords who miss targets face being fined by the council for breaching tenancy agreements if they don\u0027t stuck to rules in its \u0027emergency maintenance policy\u0027, which state that homes with newborns should have boilers and heating fixed \u0027within four days\u0027. Mr Wilson said he was giving the evicted single mothers \u0027two months\u0027 grace\u0027 to find somewhere else to live.He told the Kentish Express: \u0027I just can\u0027t risk something going wrong and not being able to get a plumber there in time - have you ever tried to get a plumber, there\u0027s a national shortage.\u0027          Multi-millionaire Mr Wilson, pictured with wife Judith, said he was \u0027forced\u0027 into the evictions over \u0027strict\u0027 council rules that could leave him with huge fines should heating systems break down homes in which babies live          Last year Mr Wilson sent this note to letting agents outlining his rules for which tenants he would rent to, including single mothersIn a letter to Cllr Gerald White, Ashford Borough Council\u0027s cabinet member for housing, Mr Wilson wrote: \u0027It is heart-breaking to terminate the contracts, but we cannot recruit staff and service the tenants.\u0027The council has brought this decision on itself.\u0027 He added: \u0027If there was a problem with hot water then we cannot get a gas safety engineer in under four days - the council requires the work be done \u0027immediately\u0027.\u0027We know we will not be able to comply with that expectation so (I) have brought these tenancies to an end.\u0027He added that he is only willing to take on mothers with children who are over the age of five, as council rules are more relaxed concerning them.Earlier this month Ashford Borough Council announced that rogue landlords faced fines of up to £30,000 if they ignore their legal responsibilities after adopting new enforcement powers, which can be dealt with by way of civil penalties, rather than through the criminal courts.Speaking earlier this month, Cllr Gerald White said he was delighted at the new enforcement powers, adding: \u0027I\u0027m supportive of the proposed implementation of the civil penalty policy to allow the council to consider imposing fines on landlords who fail to comply with housing law, as an alternative to prosecution.\u0027Implementing the policy will hopefully deter landlords from failing in their responsibilities in providing safe homes and ensuring that they comply with the relevant housing law.\u0027A spokesman for Ashford Borough Council said it only used enforcement action against landlords as a \u0027last resort\u0027.          Mr Wilson owns many properties in the Park Farm area of Ashford, picturedHe said: \u0027We have duty to ensure decent standards for tenant who are renting privately.\u0027We always work with landlords to ensure those standards are met and try to assist them as much as possible.\u0027Formal enforcement action is very much a last resort, but we will take action where necessary.\u0027Mr Wilson was taken to court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission over his attempts to \u0027ban\u0027 Pakistani and Indian tenants and it was ruled unlawful because it was discriminatory.He was handed a three-year injunction banning him from stopping tenants renting his homes because of their race - and he could be fined or face time in jail if he breaches it.At the height of the couple\u0027s property empire, the former maths teachers owned just under 1,000 homes - mainly two and three bed properties - worth just under £200million.Despite selling off around 400 homes in recent times, Mr Wilson and his wife still have a large property portfolio."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/19/18/06E3B39A000003E8-5970335-Mr_Juncker_pictured_being_helped_along_at_the_NATO_summit_earlie-a-2_1532020237321.jpg","title":"Jean Claude Juncker accused alcoholic govern","story":"    The EU Council President (pictured being helped along as he stumbles at the NATO summit earlier this month) has been accused of being an alcoholic who binges on gin and leaves his ambitious but unelected deputy to govern, according to explosive new claims          Mr Juncker (pictured being helped along at the NATO summit earlier this month) has always strongly denied claims he is an alcoholic          Mr Juncker was also photographed unable to climb the steps to the podium and being pushed around in a wheelchair at last week\u0027s NATO summit (pictured) - raising questions about his health and ability to governHunt for the Commons litter bug!

But this is hardly a comprehensive exhibition – and you really can have too much blueAi Weiwei’s crabs, Lawrence Weiner’s texts, Michelangelo Pistoletto’s smashed mirrors and Jenny Holzer’s redacted military documents have all given the baroque pile of Blenheim Palace – home to the dukes of Marlborough and birthplace of Winston Churchill – a jolt over the past few years. Inviting living artists to insinuate their works into this world heritage site, major tourist attraction and stately home is one thing. Mounting what the Blenheim Art Foundation insists is the most comprehensive exhibition of Yves Klein in Britain to date is another.The huge rectangle of ultramarine pigment on the floor of the large entrance hall, a recreation of a 1957 Pure Pigment installation, is ravishing – a bottomless visual pool for the eye, thrumming across the floor. Klein died from a heart attack in 1962, at the age of 35. Had he lived, he would have been 90 this year. Later, we come to a large canvas covered in the same adulterated ultramarine, a colour Klein managed to patent as International Klein Blue (IKB). It is his signature colour, representing the void. The void at the heart of this show is also unavoidable.The exhibition bills itself as containing more than 50 works. But it feels like the most meagre survey of the French artist I have seen. There may be getting on for 50 objects here, but this barely counts as a comprehensive survey. His early monochrome paintings – in green, red and rose – are often badly lit, hung over doorways, between stuffed stag heads or, in one case, over a cabinet of lead Napoleonic soldiers. The dripping swipe of red above the cabinet is almost like a regimental flag of blood.There are points where an effort has been made to integrate Klein into the stately home setting dramatically, yet the collisions become repetitive, however jarring they are. A narrow black monochrome, like a detail of a raincloud ,hangs over a cabinet of Fukien Blanc-de-Chine teacups, as though to situate Klein’s painting as a detail of a Chinese ink painting. Klein’s ordinary saucers and dinner plates – smeared with reds, pinks and that famous blue – have been placed in cabinets of Sèvres and Meissen crockery. These are fun. Klein’s plates, with their caked pigment, look like they had been used as palettes. Perhaps they were. He also turned the natural sponges he used to paint with into sculptures, mounting them on armatures. On one side table, I notice a group of coloured cylinders – the dried commercial paint rollers he also used. Blue spheres and globes of the world, multiple small-scale replicas of the Louvre’s Venus of Alexandria, all covered in blue, like the blue folding room-ider. How one wearies of so much blue, even though the colour sings and aches against the fusty furnishings, the faded beige and reds of old tapestries, the marble and mahogany furniture, the crimson wallpaper. Blue spheres dangle among the chandeliers, and his paintings blare next to the family portraits ands mythological scenes, the brown landscapes and the blackened varnish. Many of Klein’s smaller objects are displayed on antique side tables, chests of drawers and plinths, roped off from the visitor. You can see them, distantly, but you can’t actually get up close for a good look.  A single Anthropometry painting – made by covering naked young women in blue pigment and having them press their bodies against the canvas, squirming and being dragged around – hangs among the gold-framed family collection. There is also a single fire painting, made using a flamethrower. These solitary examples highlight that this is far from a useful survey of Klein’s art. Some other works are posthumous editions, and serve no useful purpose. This is an exhibition with no catalogue, no scholarship, no real purpose except to decorate the space. In 1995, the Hayward Gallery in London mounted a major Klein retrospective, while Tate Liverpool did a Klein show last year. To be different, Blenheim might at least have dyed the fountains blue, or daubed the statue of Queen Anne with IKB. To either side of her hang Klein’s blue life-casts of artist Arman and poet Claude Pascal, both friends of the artist since childhood, each presented against gold-leaf panels. You almost expect Queen Anne to give them a swipe with her sceptre. Klein, a consummate showman whose art became more and more of a performance, would probably have loved all this. He was a self-publicist as much a as sage. I imagine him cloaked and in his dress uniform as Knight of St Sebastian, white-gloved and bow-tied, moving among the aristocracy. Yves le Monochrome, 4th dan Judo expert, devotee of Saint Rita, the kind of man who, the critic Harold Rosenberg quipped, would keep an ocelot for a pet. He had his female “living paintbrushes” squirm about the canvas before an audience, while a live orchestra played. He made his fire paintings at the Gaz de France testing centre. Perhaps thinking of Hans Namuth’s famous photographs of Jackson Pollock painting, he made sure that the making of his later art invariably became a photo-opportunity. Klein got up people’s noses in life, but all the tour guides at Blenheim seem keen and eager to insert him into their homilies and their anecdotes. The exhibition peters out in the Long Library, with a series of large photographic wall panels documenting his “Zone of immaterial pictorial sensibility” performance in 1962. The panels are instructive, but not in themselves artworks. Beyond, the Gallery Room in the Stables Courtyard is given over to a time-line of Klein’s life and career. I thought there was another large Anthropometry painting here, but it is only an oversized inkjet reproduction. Klein was great, but this is unbearable.

The decline was also partly the result of a one-off boost to profits in the previous year from the sale of Sports Direct’s Dunlop business and shares in rival retailer JD Sports.Despite the fall in profits, the company revealed it is to pay out £5m to Michael Murray, the partner of Ashley’s daughter who advises the company on property transactions. The company said the fee was based on the “value created” by Murray and covered his work over the three years to March. Murray has also been handed the role of “head of elevation”, leading Ashley’s drive to move Sports Direct upmarket and become known as “the Selfridges of Sport”. Sports Direct’s finance director, John Kempster, said: “The group has always had a performance-related pay culture and this is very much in the same box.”Toys R Us: 180 stores employing 3,000 staff, collapsed 28 February. Owes £15m in VAT, due by 1 March.Maplin: 200 electronics and gadget stores, founded 1972, also failed on 28 February.Warren Evans:\u0026nbspbedmaker went into administration earlier in February.East: fashion brand with nearly 50 outlets folded in January.Juice Corp: business behind brands including Elizabeth Emanuel and Joe Bloggs went under in January.Multiyork: furniture chain with 50 stores went into administration in November.Feather \u0026amp Black: bedroom furniture and bedding specialist with 25 outlets fell into administration in November.Debenhams, a 178-store chain that is more than 200 years old, is axing one in four of its managers and considering closures to cut costs. It has warned that profits have been hit by lower than expected sales, with profit margins also down as a result of having to cut prices to match rivals.Kempster said the firm was “very happy with the results”, adding: “In a tough market maintaining sales is OK.” Kempster said Sports Direct had benefited from England’s run in the World Cup as fans snapped up replica shirts. However, Kempster described the overall World Cup impact on trade as only “a blip” because the retailer was now an international business and included fashion chains such as Flannels and USC.Despite the financial blow from the Debenhams investment, Kempster said that strategic punts on the shares of rival retailers were “part of our DNA”. He said Sports Direct was talking to the ailing department store about initiatives that might help both retailers.Sports Direct said it was continuing to pay all staff, including casual workers, hourly rates above the national minimum wage, as well as commission and other rewards worth £20m a year.The unusual statement follows a  investigation in 2015 which found that temporary workers at Sports Direct were effectively receiving hourly rates of pay below the minimum wage.“There aren’t many companies that feel the need to state compliance with the National Living Wage in their annual results – but then Sports Direct isn’t renowned for diligently following corporate etiquette,” said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c879af1d91ed19ede6f42f25dbd32ac6cb96b49/0_187_3566_2140/master/3566.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a25922ff9481d699e815919853c3ea5e","title":"compensation scheme windrush amends sajid javid","story":"We are launching a consultation so that people can have their say on how compensation should workThe wrongs suffered by the Windrush generation shocked us all and since becoming home secretary I have made it my personal mission to rectify the injustices of the past. Over the past few months I have heard many sobering stories about the difficulties they have faced. These have struck a personal chord, particularly because the same thing could have easily happened to my parents, who came to this country from the Commonwealth in the 1960s.The government has already announced a series of urgent measures to put things right. We have set up a taskforce that has helped more than 2,000 people get the documentation they need to demonstrate their right to be here and more than 500 people apply for citizenship for free. We have also introduced legislation to give a legal footing to our Windrush scheme, which outlines the support we are offering. On top of this, we have been proactively reaching out and engaging with those affected, both in the UK and overseas.I am regularly meeting Caribbean high commissioners to keep them updated on the work we are doing, and I have also commissioned an independent lessons-learned review to make sure something like this does not happen again.But it is clear there is more we need to do to ensure we right all the wrongs that have taken place. That is why I also announced that we would be setting up a compensation scheme to reimburse members of the Windrush generation – who have built a life in the UK and contributed so much – for the losses they have suffered.Today is a key milestone towards that commitment. It is always important for the government to listen, and the consultation we have launched will give people the opportunity to shape the design of the compensation scheme we introduce. I want a scheme that is fair, comprehensive and accessible – and am eager to hear from as many people as possible about how it should work. Martin Forde – himself the son of Windrush parents – will give independent oversight of the process.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What happened to them?An estimated 50,000 people faced the risk of deportation if they had never formalised their residency status and did not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspIt stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?A new Home Office team\u0026nbspwas set up to ensure Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally. But a month after one minister promised the cases would be resolved within two weeks,\u0026nbspmany remain destitute.Of course, I am not deaf to the calls for this to be brought in faster and sooner – but I want to get this right. Our call for evidence received more than 650 responses from people about the personal, financial and social difficulties that they have faced. These first-hand accounts have formed the basis of our consultation. We will work at pace to reflect on the consultation responses and to build a scheme that delivers on my promise to right the wrongs that have been done.As we approach the summer recess, I also want to make clear that our work does not stop. Just because parliament is not sitting, it does not mean the work of MPs and the government stops too. Our taskforce will continue its work, and our volunteer network and staff will continue to reach out to make sure our messages are being heard. Alongside this, we will continue the vital work to establish exactly what went wrong and how we prevent it happening again.Our reviews of detention, removals and compliant environment will progress and Wendy Williams, the independent adviser of the lessons learned review, will take forward her important work – the terms of reference for which have been published today. We have a long way to go, but I am committed to this cause, and I will ensure that we are doing all we can to make amends.• Sajid Javid is the UK home secretary"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ea0f2959ba0c85f5f394f8daefcf183319d21a5/0_119_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c8e67d218f4362895793a28132986a9","title":"liam fox trade secretary britain brexit","story":"The trade secretary is busy pitching Britain into a global race to the bottom after Brexit. But there’s still time to stop himThis week’s narrow votes on the trade bill was a major victory for the hard Brexiteers. Theresa May’s government has effectively killed off its own Chequers plan and laid the road for a Brexit based on deregulation and liberalisation. And while they were at it, they stamped on attempts to give parliament sovereignty over trade policy, just to make sure no pesky MP could get in the way of their plans for a free-market “Singapore-on-Thames”.The next day the trade secretary, Liam Fox, lost no time in launching consultations on joining the TransPacific Partnership (TPP) as well as a trade deal with the US. Britain’s distance from the Pacific is apparently no obstacle. Both the TPP and a US trade deal would lower standards, undermine public services like the NHS and make it more difficult for us to protect the environment. They are incompatible with the frictionless trade in goods with the EU May promised at Chequers. Donald Trump told the government as much last weekend.Trump’s intervention helped empower hard-right Conservative MPs, who then threatened to vote against May unless they got what they wanted. In response, May threatened to call a general election unless an amendment that wasn’t so very different from May’s own Chequers position was defeated. Twelve Tories understood the consequences and rebelled. May was only saved by the intervention of four Labour Brexiteers.This was one of the most significant parliamentary votes since the EU referendum. Why? Because for the hardcore Brexiteers, unlike most people who voted to leave the EU, Brexit isn’t really about sovereignty or immigration per se, it’s about trade policy. Through trade policy, the political right can deregulate and liberalise the British economy with virtually no oversight from parliament or the public. In fact, they must hope that the economic dislocation caused by a break with the EU will provide a once-in-a-generation panic conducive to signing any trade deal going.The TPP fits the bill nicely. It is a mechanism that Fox wants to use to create his economic paradise and push us away from the EU. The deal, which includes Australia, Japan, Mexico, Peru and Vietnam, is so toxic that even its main proponent, the US, pulled out, following major struggles across US involving unions, environmentalists and progressive politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.Just like it’s better known cousin, TTIP (the Transatlantic Trade \u0026amp Investment Partnership deal between the EU and US), the TPP was dreamed up by big business, and has less to do with trade than making life more profitable for transnational corporations. That means standardising (read: lowering) regulations. Hormone-fed, steroid-filled and chlorine-washed meat must be allowed into your markets or you’ll be accused of obstructing free trade.TPP would allow big financial players to challenge government rules to regulate banks or clamp down on risky financial products. It would hand the tech giants like Google and Amazon much greater power to use – and abuse – your data. It would extend the monopoly rights of big pharmaceutical corporations, cutting off the citizens of poorer countries from affordable life-saving drugs, while also making it harder for the NHS to negotiate cheaper prices for medicines. It would gut the ability of local government to use taxes to stimulate local farming and the local economy.Just as with the TTIP, TPP includes a toxic “corporate court” system, which gives transnational corporations a special arbitration system to sue governments when they enact any policy that the investor doesn’t like. Putting cigarettes in plain packaging, banning dangerous chemicals, raising the minimum wage, stopping polluting power plants being built – anything that might affect big business’s bottom line can lead to a claim being lodged.Liam Fox is a great fan of the TPP. The TPP represents a long-term ambition to fundamentally reorient the UK towards a glorious low-regulation, “free-market” future. Fox claims we have no need to worry. After all, wasn’t TTIP stopped by European politicians? The problem is that European politicians, while derided by hard Brexiteers for being powerless, actually had a real say over TTIP. They could read all the negotiating texts. They could publicly debate impact assessment to make their case. And they could, ultimately, vote to stop it.On Tuesday, the government decided it would be wrong for our own MPs to have similar powers. An amendment by the Green MP Caroline Lucas would have given MPs the final say over any trade deal negotiated, as well as proper scrutiny powers to hold the government to account. The amendment would have done nothing to get in the way of leaving the EU, it would simply have returned full sovereignty to parliament. But it would have endangered the hard Brexiteers plans for our country. So despite support from Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru, the amendment fell by 30 votes.Of course, Fox is working away on numerous deals already. More than a dozen working groups have been set up with other countries, but neither MPs nor the public are allowed to know what’s discussed, or even when the working groups meet. Leaked information has been obtained from the US and Indian governments – but nothing from our own “world class” freedom of information powers. We’re now being consulted on trade deals with the US, Australia and New Zealand, but with no real information as to what these deals would mean for us, though they would affect all of us in quite profound ways.It’s not too late to stop all this. The trade bill now goes to the Lords, where amendments are likely. When it returns to the Commons we know to expect more arm-twisting and bullying. But MPs must stand up: this is epoch-defining stuff. There is still time to stop a “Liam Fox Brexit”.

From Brussels comes Project Fear Mk II, a “preparedness” guide for Europe if there is no deal on Brexit. It is Brussels-speak for a terrorism red alert. It covers such things as passports, air traffic control, financial transfers, military bases, data protection, medicines licensing and all the border clutter we have spent half a century removing. Unlike the remainers’ bloodcurdling Project Fear in 2016, this is not an economic fake forecast. It is frontline reality. It is Brexit as Grand Theft Auto.Britain’s National Audit Office is joining in. This week it warned that, as of next March, Britons driving on the continent will need new driving permits in the event of a no-deal Brexit. There must be gigantic laybys for traffic jams at Folkestone and staff for “huge bureaucratic delays”. Airbus and Rolls-Royce are already stockpiling spares against a new tariff regime. AstraZeneca is stockpiling medicines. Theresa May is touring the Irish border, like a field-marshal surveying trenches\u0026nbspon\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspSomme.Do we laugh or cry? I am still laughing, just. The car-crash option is favoured by some leave ideologues. They are technically right that in March a no-deal UK would “crash out” of the EU and revert to World Trade Organization rules. Such anarchy has disruptive appeal to those careless of other people’s jobs, while “taking back control of borders” would meet the leavers’ prime target of stricter immigration control. But the EU allows no new deals with third-party countries, under WTO rules or whatever, until the UK is out next year. In March, ports would swiftly clog up. The movement of people and tourism would plummet. It would be chaos, and even after that “new deals with the rest of the world” could not possibly compensate.In reality, everyone knowledgeable about Brexit agrees on what will really happen if there is no deal in March. Nothing will change. Planes will keep flying. Ferries will keep loading. Channel Tunnel officials will wave vehicles through. Orders will go out to keep moving, and await further instructions. People at the coalface of the European economy cannot afford the posturing, vanity and idiocy of the Brexit parliament this past week. They have lives to live and mouths to feed. A closed border with the EU, not least in Ireland, would be like closing the Berlin Wall after it had reopened. There would be riots. That is why crashing out would not mean hard Brexit, but rather remain in all but name. When Brexit fantasy hits practical reality, reality will win.Hard Brexit was surely put to bed by Boris Johnson’s resignation speech in the Commons this week, a confection of negativity and verbosity. He offered no “frictionless” alternative to a customs union with the rest of Europe. The UK may be leaving the EU – for which I believe there is something to be said – but it makes no sense to erect trade barriers between an island and its neighbouring continent. Britain has spent a century moving in the opposite direction. Even in the 1950s, when it dreamed of a greater imperial market, it joined Europe’s free trade zone, forerunner of the present European Economic Area. Hard Brexit is flat-Earthism.The failure of the House of Commons this week to vote in favour of a customs union, as opposed to May’s botched Chequers plan, was a lost opportunity. Johnson might call the plan a “fantastical Heath Robinson arrangement”, but that was because May changed it to win his support. It is his fault. She should not have bothered. As a result, the opportunity to negotiate a customs union in Brussels from a united, bipartisan base with Labour was scuppered.The public was promised Brexit, which, as May keeps\u0026nbspsaying, means Brexit. That is happening. It was also promised frictionless trade, which means frictionless. That is achievable only under a customs union and single market.As a result of the current shambles, the new Brexit minister, Dominic Raab, must go to Brussels to negotiate “frictionless” on the basis of Chequers, not a simple customs union. The difference is over agreeing tariff collection and regulatory alignment on trading standards. This is all but trivial. Even if the UK were to go for hard Brexit, trade with the EU would still need some such agreement, as would the much-vaunted, largely fantasy, deals with the rest of the world. Talk of Chequers as “vassalage” is ludicrous. Taking back control of trade was always making a mountain of a molehill.The outcome of Raab’s negotiations will be messier than were he negotiating on the basis of remaining in the EEA. But the destination has to be the same. There may be more bloodletting ahead but, come the autumn, I am sure we will all be in sight of the Norway option. Whatever may one day be agreed on migration – still Brexit’s hard core and still to be negotiated – a customs union between the nations of Europe cannot be avoided.Prudent government should always be on guard against car crashes. It is not scaremongering to inspect the fenders and check the airbags. But a crash on Brexit will not happen, and even if it did, the outcome would not be “crashing out” of Europe but rather crashing in. The UK is going to leave the EU next spring. That is law. But no one was asked if they wanted to leave Europe’s economic community. We were promised frictionless. If Westminster’s midsummer madness does lead to a car crash, so be it. In the longer run it will make no difference.

It is a proposition for “peace” that violates the most basic requirements for a just and sustainable solution, flouts international law, contradicts the global consensus on peace (which in itself constitutes a major compromise by the Palestinians), and even departs from the declared policies of several previous US administrations.The “ultimate deal” suffers from multiple fatal flaws and misconceptions that several successive US administrations have repeatedly failed to recognise. The spirit of the Palestinian people cannot be broken or brought into submission nor will we ever succumb to external pressure and blackmail. To expect us to surrender our rights and freedom in exchange for a mythical “economic peace” is nothing short of a flight of fancy.The US partnership with the Israeli occupation came to a head with Trump’s highly contentious recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and then, in another act of provocation, his moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The decision emboldened the rightwing, racist, ethno-sectarian and hyper-nationalist forces in Israel – and gave the Israeli government the green light to colonise more Palestinian land and effectively deal the final blow to an already ailing two-state solution. The inability to recognise that Jerusalem is the historical, cultural, geographic and demographic heart of Palestine already set up the “ultimate deal” for failure. Jerusalem is the linchpin of peace.The same ideology that violated Jerusalem is also behind the US administration’s assault on Palestinian refugees and their right of return – a universally recognised right that cannot be denied just to accommodate Israel’s exclusivity and exclusionary policies. The Trump administration targeted Palestinian refugees by cutting funding from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) – and denying them access to healthcare, education and social services. Palestinian refugees have been longing for home for 70 years after being violently uprooted and expelled from their ancestral homeland. To deprive them of their rights and to crush their hopes and aspirations for redress and a life worth living is the utmost cruelty. Such an injustice will also fuel the flames of extremism and violence, leading to further regional instability and conflict. In addition to being morally reprehensible, such a policy is utterly dangerous and irresponsible.The “ultimate deal” does not intend to offer a solution but rather to reinvent the occupation as a system of military and unaccountable control, and accommodate the continuing theft and fragmentation of our land, thereby relegating us to imprisonment in isolated territories at the mercy of Israeli security control. It further suffers from the illusion that the Palestinian people will give up their deep historical, cultural, and national commitment to Jerusalem – and relinquish the rights of our refugees.The US should abandon its misguided assumption that anyone, whether in the region or beyond, can “deliver” the Palestinian people or sign up on our behalf. This approach, concocted by a team of US “peacemakers”, is one-sided, misplaced and totally orced from genuine peacemaking. It has only reaffirmed that Jared Kushner, Jason Greenblatt and US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, are extensions of the most extreme rightwing Israeli government coalition and its active lobbyists and campaign donors in the US. One would have to be totally delusional to expect any kind of justice or genuine peace from such “peacemakers”, who are complicit in financing the illegal Israeli settlements that are forcibly built on stolen Palestinian land.The two-state solution on the 1967 borders is the internationally recognised framework for a workable solution. In this context, the Arab peace initiative (API) has attempted to offer a formula for a comprehensive regional peace. The API cannot be turned on its head for an “outside-in” approach that seeks to offer Israel advance payments and rewards, normalisation and recognition, while it continues to occupy and oppress an entire people.If there is one thing the US must not do it is underestimate the resilience of the Palestinian people. Despite this dark chapter in our history, we will remain committed to a life of freedom, dignity and peace – and will persist in our struggle for justice and historical redemption.• Dr Hanan Ashrawi is a Palestinian politician and leader.

For me the choice was whether to train as a secondary English or primary school teacher.After much thought, I applied for a primary place on the Teach First Leadership Development Programme and, to my surprise, was offered early years – back then, I wasn’t even entirely clear what “early years” meant (it’s from birth to age five). But after some research into the play-based ethos of the curriculum for the under-fives, I chose to accept. A year or so later, I stood nervously at the gates of the east London nursery and children’s centre, at which I was to spend the first two years of my career.My choice didn’t go unchallenged. More than a few people raised concerns with me about the pitfalls of being a man working in early years. These pertained primarily to an irrational culture of suspicion surrounding such men, and I was warned a number of times that I’d have to be “extra careful”.It didn’t help that around this time I watched Thomas Vinterberg’s powerful drama The Hunt, about a Danish kindergarten teacher wrongly accused of abusing a child in his class. I also had anxieties about whether there would be sufficient opportunities for career progression, and the extent to which I would feel adequately challenged.When I look back on how I felt that first day at the gates of my new workplace, I can understand why. However, thrown straight into the process of welcoming a new class, there was no time to dwell on anything, and any fears I had about challenge were swiftly alleviated. While I was the only male in the team, and still am, I did not feel in any way the focus of anyone’s suspicion. I simply asked a few questions about the policies on contact with children, which were met with clarity and reassurance, and got on with the job.I am now nearing the end of my second year and would describe my time in the classroom as a rich and fascinating experience. But it has not been easy, and I am passionate that others in the wider teaching profession and beyond understand the refined skillset required for success in early years (I’ve heard too many fellow teachers talk down teaching in early years). We need to strive for a much better gender balance among early years teachers. Good role models for boys early on in life are essential, particularly considering the gender gap. While these role models can, of course, be male or female, if boys see men immersed in picture books, belting out nursery rhymes, and drawing and talking about pictures with enthusiasm, it stands to reason they’ll feel that these are things they too can enjoy.It can’t be underestimated just how important it is for boys to experience men in caring, nurturing roles if they are to grow into the kind of adults we want in society. It can also have a positive effect on girls’ expectations of the men in their lives. And it’s important to have a erse workforce, with a variety of interaction styles, interests and approaches to teaching, to ensure children are receiving an appropriately rounded education reflecting the gender balance in their communities.Striving for greater balance in a traditionally female-centric profession is also a constructive move in the wider context of gender equality. Demonstrating that men are also prepared to adapt and challenge long-established norms can only be a good thing.So how do we promote nursery teaching as a positive career for men? There are no simple solutions, but we must avoid stereotyping and work to promote a better understanding and appreciation of early years education as a tough and rewarding career for both men and women. There should also be an onus on schools and nurseries to encourage men already in the teaching profession to think about positions in nursery and reception classes.The benefits for me, both personally and professionally, of teaching in early years have been immense, and I have felt in no way out of place I am simply another member of a great team in our nursery. I highly recommend it.• Tim Cooke is a freelance journalist and teacher"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74875037b3b652bde5ff57dc143a5c8e940d8497/706_3_1415_849/master/1415.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=911d9213db724e55914d34c15d03e991","title":"george michael last christmas","story":"Screenplay co-written by Emma Thompson, due to be directed by Paul Feig, was developed with the Wham! singer before his deathLast Christmas, a “holiday romance set in London” co-scripted by Emma Thompson and Bryony Kimmings and recently acquired by Hollywood studio Universal, was inspired by the 1984 Wham! hit written by George Michael. The script was developed with Michael’s participation until his death in 2016.In an interview with Radio Times, Kimmings said: “When I came on board, George was up for it. He’d already signed something to say yes, but he’d passed away.”Saying that the idea had been developed by Michael, Thompson and Thompson’s husband, the actor Greg Wise, Kimmings said she had already turned in her draft of the script and included the kind of “queer politics” Michael was interested in. “I tried to slip in some trans people and make sure there was queer politics in there … I don’t know how much of that remains!”She added: “I doubt there’ll be a trans lead … But I hope that there’s quite an element of queer in there, because you know it’s the story – it’s based on the song, Last Christmas. George was such a massive advocate for gay rights – and a massive gay himself! – so I hope there’s a gay narrative in there.”Last Christmas is due to be directed by Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig, who is currently completing work on A Simple Favor, a mystery thriller about a blogger whose best friend disappears.

And, by unselfishly giving a global platform to British artists, he has found that respect returned‘You know I’ve applied for your passport, right?” the British DJ Charlie Sloth says to Drake after the rapper’s Fire in the Booth freestyle verse on BBC Radio 1Xtra – the joke being that the Canadian is over in the UK so much, and aligns himself with its music culture so strongly, that he might as well move here permanently.For Fire in the Booth, MCs deliver long-form, often withering verses, free of the demands of song structure. And while Drake’s entry may not have the political ferocity of Akala’s, the determination of Wretch 32’s, or the spectacular endurance of Kano’s, he acquits himself well. His take may seem flat and incantatory to some, it is riveting when he spills over bar ides.It followed another UK freestyle he delivered this month for the online channel Link Up TV. Over a light and ghostly drill beat, Drake dipped into UK slang such as “paigon” and “road” with a flow that nodded to London rappers such as Headie One and Skengdo, and an accent that veered between Jamaica, Brixton and his native Canada. Some listeners cringed: there’s a slight air of a trendy youth worker or, worse, a racist impersonator.But like his Fire in the Booth, the freestyle became a sensation and Drake got away with that accent – his mixed-race heritage and background in cosmopolitan, West Indian-influenced Toronto means he can borrow from across cultures more authentically than other artists. “That’s how he talks – when you’re out with him … he’s saying ‘me and the mandem’,” Sloth tells me. “It’s not an act, it’s not Drake trying to fit in.”More importantly, the two freestyles come off the back of years of British patronage. His 2010 debut album was American through and through, but after a UK tour that saw him watch Chelsea, eat at the Wolseley, and – very Drake, this – buy first editions of Charlotte’s Web and Winnie-the-Pooh, he started working with the Londoners Jamie xx for his second album, Take Care (2011). Another emotive neo-balladeer, Sampha, from south London, was featured on his third album, Nothing Was the Same (2013), along with the Scottish producer Hudson Mohawke.At around the same time, Drake also started getting into British rap, naming the grime originator Wiley when asked about his favourite MCs, and then quoting the Tottenham MC Skepta on a track with Lil Wayne. His Instagram briefly became a digital shrine to grime rap battles, humbly saying the clash between Skepta and Devilman was “a true reminder that, whenever you think you’re good at what you do, there’s most likely two people out there that will yam your food”.Drake has since taken the energy of these relatively small-scale spats and turned then into blockbuster sparring – his recent tete-a-tetes with Meek Mill and Pusha T have been two of the most acid and discussed beefs in hip-hop history. Skepta took credit in 2015: “That’s a real London, grime attitude to have. It’s good, it’s battle rapping … I definitely think that my vibe has rubbed off on Drake a bit.” For his part, Skepta opened up his track Shutdown with a Drake sample, and the pair got tattoos of each other’s crew symbols and joined forces for a track with the Nigerian pop star Wizkid.Drake’s patronage started moving beyond grime into London’s road rap scene, hopping on stage with Section Boyz in 2016 for his own track Jumpman in a seamless segue. US hip-hop was always a component of grime’s syntax, but this performance underlined how blended both cultures had become, each with digital access to an entire world of rap as well as the styles on their respective doorsteps.In 2017, alongside the Midlands soul singer Jorja Smith, Drake worked with the south London rapper Giggs on two tracks for More Life. One, KMT, became a moshpit anthem in the UK but was decried by DJ Akademiks in the US as “other people’s musical culture infiltrating, and kinda almost being forced upon US hip-hop culture” – a view that underlines how progressive Drake’s approach is in the context of a US rap scene that has long ignored the UK. “Unselfishly, he has provided a platform for British artists to excel,” Sloth says.Drake has talked of his phone filling up with +44 codes on a remix for the young south London rapper Dave, while his wardrobe filled up with British “roadman” staple Stone Island. And he became such a fan of the black British drama Top Boy that he bought the rights. A series revival is coming up in 2019. As his Link Up freestyle shows, he has kept up to date with the recent drill sound, too, also namechecking Loski in an Instagram story hymning the influences on his new album Scorpion. “Drill is a genre that has had so much negative press, so to have the biggest superstar on the planet tip his hat to that art form … everyone was grateful,” Sloth says.Some of Drake’s moves are canny, even cynical, but he clearly has a deep engagement with British culture, and it has been reciprocated: his latest pop track, In My Feelings, is likely to hit No 1 in the UK this week. But by also being an outsider in today’s radically porous and permissive London music scene, he has shown that anyone – through sheer respect and skill – can ascend to the top of it, even a Canadian who sounds as if he is from Camberwell."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7703772a135a052d6c48e76d27a957207816874/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ee47737c830d15c4dec4a0e09c253a","title":"how to spend it the shopping list for the 1 percent","story":"In an age of astonishing wealth, nothing reveals the lives of the ultra-rich like the FT’s unashamedly ostentatious luxury magazine. On 7 October 1967, the Financial Times, then the most buttoned-up newspaper in Britain and quite possibly the world, discreetly added a regular new page to its Saturday edition. Buried deep inside the paper, behind the usual thicket of articles about share prices and companies and pensions, the page was introduced to readers a little euphemistically, as “a guide to good living”. In small letters across the top of the page, the FT spelled out what “good living” meant. The page was called How to Spend It.In the still slightly austere postwar Britain of 1967, where the great majority of the FT’s prosperous readership of 150,000 lived, spending opportunities were limited. The new, monochrome page had an article about installing home central heating, then a relative luxury about a new electric coffee maker and about how to select and cook a pheasant: “Choose carefully. Hens are always best.” The most expansive piece was on an old-fashioned Scottish hotel owned by state-run British Rail. “The visitor is received with all the ceremony of an arrival at a country house,” wrote the reviewer. “You go into the immense hall and no one takes any notice.”The original one-page section has swelled into a thick, lustrous, large-format magazine, almost the size of a tabloid newspaper, which now appears 34 times a year, distributed with the FT across the world on Fridays and weekends. There is also an elaborate website, updated daily – and, unlike the FT’s main website, presented without a paywall. Under consumer capitalism, you are what you buy – or would like to buy. But the rich are different from everyone else in their consumption, because they can afford almost anything. Their challenge is choosing. The key role in this process played over decades by How to Spend It has made it an almost unique social lens, through which we can see how much the world has polarised since the egalitarian 1960s and 70s.Together, the magazine and website form “an elegant luxury environment for readers and advertisers”, as the FT’s promotional material puts it. At How to Spend It, “the world’s most desirable audience, with the largest purchasing power and highest net worth” is – in theory at least – judiciously steered by expert FT journalists towards the correct purchasing decisions. The magazine usually has between 80 and 100 pages. About half of them are advertisements, for the biggest global luxury brands and for more singular commodities, such as art and property. The other pages are a gleaming parade of articles – not always easy to tell from the ads – about the most expensive fashion, travel, food, interior design and other consumer goods imaginable.A long recent feature suggests “a sumptuous gastronomic tour of Spain by private jet”, three days long “from £6,995 per person”. An artfully casual page of recommended “knick-knackery” includes a “Chaumet Liens Lumière Watch in gold with diamonds and mother-of-pearl on alligator strap”, costing £12,870. A 2012 article on home furnishings with an aeronautical theme included a decommissioned Sky Flash air-to-air missile, polished to a perfect sheen and mounted on a pedestal: “This could be sitting in your drawing room for a mere £29,500.” To read How to Spend It, depending on your income level and attitude to extravagance, is to enter a world that is seductive or ridiculous, escapist or intimidating, a voyeuristic thrill or utterly enraging – and possibly all at the same time.Most consumer journalism draws readers to products within, or just beyond, their financial reach. But How to Spend It “is not aspirational”, says Qing Wang, a professor at Warwick Business School and an authority on the consumption habits of the very wealthy. “It’s for those who’ve made it, for the exclusive enjoyment of them and their kind.” Not all How to Spend It readers are rich, but a lot of them are. According to the FT, “Half have or would consider paying $14,000+ on a high-end watch” and “1 in 5 have or would consider using the service of a private jet”.Wang says: “How to Spend It can be sophisticated, but in the end, it’s all about status. Many of its readers are bankers, or businessmen from China and India – quite blunt people. They like the magazine’s directness. They pick it up thinking: ‘Just tell me what I need.’”“The magazine has a great conversion rate for advertisers,” or turning ads into sales, says Alice Pickthall of the media research firm Enders Analysis. A former FT journalist says: “Some readers take How to Spend It into a shop, point at a picture in it, and say: ‘I want that watch.’ It’s the Argos catalogue for rich people.”The consumption habits of this elite matter increasingly to all of us the spending decisions of the rich are now economic and social forces of enormous power. “As the rich have been getting progressively richer,” an analysis by the US investment bank Citigroup found in 2005, they have been “saving less and spending more”. Unlike other consumers, the report went on, the rich find many products, such as designer clothes, more desirable the more expensive they become. The countries where the rich congregate, such as Britain, Canada and the US, have been changed radically by this frenzy of spending: they have become “Plutonomies – economies powered by the wealthy”.Another sign of a plutonomy is that more and more high-profile institutions – universities, museums, media organisations – are dependent on the wealthy for funding or subsidy. Today’s FT is more cosmopolitan and influential than when it produced its first How to Spend It page in 1967. It is one of the most prestigious and important newspapers in the world. Less than a third of its 900,000 subscribers now live in the UK and as well as authoritative business reporting, it is increasingly known for its urbane tone and its investigations – notably in recent months about sexual harassment at the Houses of Parliament and the (now disbanded) Presidents Club in London, and about alleged bullying at the British advertising giant WPP.Yet the FT is also a less secure paper than it was half a century ago, with print media in decline and the advertising revenues from online journalism uncertain. In 2015, the paper was sold for £844m by its owners since 1957, Pearson, to the Japanese media company Nikkei. In 2016, the latest year for which accounts are available, the FT as a whole made a pre-tax profit of £6.2m on revenues of £311m: a substantial success for a traditional media brand, but a thin profit margin by corporate standards.Nobody outside the FT knows exactly how much of that revenue comes from the advertisements in How to Spend It. Like other papers, the FT does not release financial results for inidual supplements. But periodically there are proud hints from the FT’s management. In 2001, the then editor Andrew Gowers said the magazine had been “profitable from the first issue”. In 2007, the FT’s current chief executive John Ridding described How to Spend It as “a fantastic franchise”. Julia Carrick, who conceived the How to Spend It magazine and was its publisher until 2015, told me: “Some of the issues were way over £1m in profit.” At its current publication rate, a conservative estimate of How to Spend It’s annual profits would be above £10m.At a recent meeting of FT executives, convened to discuss the long-term future of the paper, the current editor, Lionel Barber, reportedly declared: “What we need is another How to Spend It.” Among senior FT management, a piece of melodramatic business jargon is sometimes used to describe the importance of How to Spend It and its editor since 1998, Gillian de Bono, to the FT’s continued existence. They are said to be “mission-critical”.How to Spend It and its readers usually radiate confidence. But its pages also inadvertently reveal that the rich have anxieties. Unlike in many other luxury magazines, almost everything covered is extremely expensive. Most products have the same kind of satiny, unblemished finish, both showy and perfectionist. Interiors are invariably neat. Interviewees are immaculate in their dress and speech. Everything is under control. Only rarely and awkwardly are references made to relevant but unsettling events outside this carefully curated world. “Post-protracted recession, repression and years of general national malaise, Zimbabwe,” an article announced in May, “is now one of the most exciting places to safari on the African continent.” As one of the magazine’s staff puts it, “Gillian gives readers permission to be rich and not feel guilty.” (This escapist approach may have attracted at least one infamous reader: in 2011, a reportedly “well-thumbed” copy of How to Spend It was found in a compound belonging to the besieged Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.)Yet while it reinforces the rich’s sense of entitlement – their sense that the world is their playground – How to Spend It also serves to remind them that they frequently lack taste. With striking bluntness, the magazine’s name says as much. “Compared with the truly fashionable, who are often less well-off, and have acquired their edge by having to choose between products,” says a prominent British writer on class and style, “seriously rich people are often ever so slightly behind the beat.”In an age of mass luxury – of mobbed designer concessions in department stores, of designer shops proliferating in seemingly every major city – how can the rich stand out? How to Spend It often advises its readers to buy limited-edition or hand-made goods. But sometimes the discernment required seems never-ending. In an issue in May, the British designer of upper-class menswear Jeremy Hackett recommended a London shoemaker, George Cleverley, whose bespoke products cost “from £3,600”. “My current order,” said Hackett, “is for some tan and white Oxfords … made from a batch of reindeer leather salvaged from the Metta Catharina – a 53-ton brigantine that sank off the southern coast of England during a voyage from St Petersburg to Genoa in 1786. The leather was tanned in St Petersburg by artisans whose techniques were secret for centuries … ” Hackett might have been joking – except that How to Spend It doesn’t do jokes.There are rarely any people in its formal, crystalline photos of palatial hotels and homes, as if readers need to have these places to themselves, as sanctuaries from the rest of the world. “How to Spend It sells a kind of tranquility – a promise that luxurious products and experiences will have a restorative effect,” Qing Wang says. “That’s what many of its readers need.”Unlike the wealthy of previous gilded ages, most of today’s rich have made their own money. Many are workaholics. “They are time-poor. They want instant satisfaction – and they also want relaxation,” adds Wang. It has been the lucrative but strenuous task of How to Spend It to fulfil these contradictory needs.How to Spend It began as a more carefree enterprise: the product of a reader’s letter and an extramarital affair. In 1958, Sheila Black, a clever former actor who was married to a tabloid editor, wrote to the then editor of the FT, the famously staid Sir Gordon Newton, to complain that his business newspaper rarely actually wrote about consumer goods. Newton responded by hiring her. She became the FT’s first female journalist, first consumer reporter, and Newton’s lover.The FT can be a conservative place, and it took nine years for Black’s work to be formalised as the How to Spend It page. She and a tiny staff were given their own office, to which Newton “would go in the evening to share a gin and tonic with Black,” her FT obituary recorded after she died in 2007. “Other staff usually took the hint and left.”Newton retired in 1972, and Black left the paper with him. For the next decade and a half, How to Spend It remained a minor part of the FT, a double-page spread at best, with breezy articles about women’s sandals, or collecting carved wooden birds sometimes it was part of a section in the paper a little patronisingly called Diversions. A puritanism lingered among the paper’s readers, and some of them objected to the name How to Spend It. In 1982, with Britain emerging unsteadily from a deep recession, one wrote to complain that the name was “inapposite to our time, vulgar and an affront”.“I sat there shaking in my shoes at the criticism,” recalled Black’s successor as How to Spend It editor, Lucia van der Post. “But I decided to publish the letter on my pages, and let the readers decide about the name, with the best response winning a case of champagne.”The section kept its name. During the mid-80s, it began to cover more luxurious products. But it did so with a degree of irony and caution. A 1985 piece about designer sunglasses reassured readers that they were “no longer just for Mafia bosses” but “an acceptable accoutrement for gentlemen”. A 1990 piece described vintage grand pianos as “a reasonable investment”. Van der Post was the daughter of the explorer and conservationist Laurens van der Post, best known for celebrating the ascetic lives of African Bushmen. The contrast between his and her attitudes to possessions seemed striking – the shift to a more materialistic world in a single family. But she wrote with infectious enthusiasm about “whatever interested me”, she told me, and she acquired a cult readership.Demand for prestige goods grew, and their prices rose sharply. Since 1982, the American business magazine Forbes has been tracking the cost of the same 40 “ultraluxe items”, such as caviar and tennis courts, to create what it calls a “Cost of Living Extremely Well Index”. This index has risen almost twice as fast as the cost of consumer goods overall.The person who has made it so since, more than anyone else, is Gillian de Bono. She joined the FT in 1994, to help Van der Post, who was not an experienced editor, run How to Spend It. De Bono was in her early 40s, and had already edited women’s magazines and the consumer journal Which? It was a populist rather than elite CV, but she had a reputation for limitless energy and fastidiousness. In 1998, Van der Post returned to full-time writing, and De Bono succeeded her as editor.One of its most fascinating but brazen regular items is a close look at the consumer desires of an inidual, titled “the Aesthete”. As its name suggests, the page is meant to be more about taste than price – a chance to show connoisseurship. But rich people and costly products predominate. In 2012, with Britain enduring the austerity policies of George Osborne, the page featured the Conservative chancellor’s father, Sir Peter Osborne. He revealed that he had his eye on a “wonderful” desk costing £19,000, and had recently been “lent a villa by an Italian friend” on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique.Like many of the rich themselves, the pages of How to Spend It have spent the turbulent decade since the financial crisis in a state of comfortable equilibrium, at the very least. “The design hasn’t changed for 10 years,” says a former staff member. The articles still unfurl in wide, stately columns the enormous photos of products are still precisely arranged and white-bordered, as if for an unusually elegant catalogue. The few pictures of people are usually of artisan producers, characterfully lined and smiling, like trusty retainers on an idealised country estate.In some ways, this conservatism is precisely what makes How to Spend It appealing to an itinerant international readership whose working lives are often in flux. The same goes for its association with the steady, respectable FT, and with a certain version of England – as a place to buy a handmade shotgun or a well-cut suit. London in particular has presented itself very effectively since the 90s as a civilised, slightly retro pleasure ground for the global rich, and How to Spend It has helped burnish that myth.If there is a How to Spend It ethos, De Bono has come to see herself as its  during her 20-year editorship. If she is presented with work she considers inadequate or unsuitable, she will say: “This is not How to Spend It. It’s not how we do it.”A small, formal woman in her mid-60s with a perfect bobbed haircut, De Bono rarely stops working. In 2014, she told the website Politico that organising the 20th anniversary issue, in which every product mentioned was eventually auctioned for charity, “consumed me day and night for nine months”. Carrick said: “She’s incredibly hard-working.” A staff member said: “When Gillian goes on holiday, she looks at every single page proof on her sun lounger, on a laptop, and then phones in changes.”The How to Spend It offices feel a little separate from the rest of the FT building in central London. The rest of the floor is open-plan, but How to Spend It’s space – a couple of dozen desks, and a corner office for De Bono – is behind a glass wall. The atmosphere is quiet and reverent: trophies won by the magazine and website stand prominently on a cabinet. The staff are mostly experienced journalists, men and women of varying ages, who work long days according to a weekly production rhythm that has been strictly maintained for years. A few are embarrassed by some of the material they process. “A 3,000-word piece on perfume – who’s reading that?” one asks rhetorically. But in the office they keep such thoughts to themselves. “Mind your own business, and do what you’re told – that’s the culture,” says another.Serving the rich is usually not for the faint-hearted. The industries that cater to their elaborate tastes are often very exacting and top-down: the rich expect the best, and are not squeamish about hierarchies. Luxury magazines are no exception, and staff at How to Spend It have often worked for others. But complaints about How to Spend It’s working culture have recently provoked a crisis at one of the FT’s most profitable assets.Last November, 18 of How to Spend It’s current and former staff filed a formal complaint under the FT’s whistleblower procedure, which permits serious allegations against managers to be submitted anonymously. As a result, the paper launched an internal inquiry into allegations of bullying against De Bono, going back more than a decade. The FT’s human resources department collected testimony from employees (some of whom now work on other sections of the FT), and compiled a dossier more than 40 pages long.Seven months later, on 7 June, the inquiry finally reported. Its findings were not made public. According to a summary of the report written by the FT’s director of HR, the inquiry described De Bono’s “management style” as sometimes “erratic and, at its worst, didactic, high-handed and … (by her own admission) impatient”. It said there was “a perception within the team that certain iniduals are being ‘targeted’” by De Bono. But it found that there was “not sufficient evidence of a history of harassment and bullying,” and cited “examples of Gillian evincing great thoughtfulness, understanding and empathy with iniduals in her team, even among those who accuse her.” The “inidual complaints” against her, the summary concluded, “have not been upheld.”This verdict has not satisfied many of those who took part in the inquiry. They feel that it was not sufficiently independent or thorough, and that the paper is protecting one of its editorial stars. “People at How to Spend It are angry,” says one. The National Union of Journalists is backing the complainants. On 20 June, its large chapel at the FT passed a motion criticising the inquiry and promising “to support the whistleblowers should they decide to take further action”.Over recent months, I have spoken at length to current and former How to Spend It staff. None of them have wanted to be named, or to have their complaints reported in any detail, for fear of being identified – luxury journalism is a small world. But their complaints are raw. One of them told me: “With Gillian, It’s always verbal. Sometimes, she does it one-on-one in her office, with the door shut. Sometimes, she explodes at you in front of everyone.”De Bono and Barber declined to be interviewed for this article. But an FT spokesperson said: “We can confirm that complaints about the management of How to Spend It were lodged last year. These were fully investigated in a rigorous, professional internal process. The complaints were not upheld. We are, however, actively looking at ways to better support the magazine’s continued rapid growth.”A senior FT source was franker: “We’re trying to bring the culture of How to Spend It closer to the rest of the paper … to improve its employee relations. Gillian is a tough cookie the damn thing wouldn’t work unless she was. But she is not the easiest person.”The magazine and its editor are still “mission-critical” to the FT. On 7 June, it was Barber who presented the inquiry’s conclusions to the How to Spend It staff. “Lionel marched into the How to Spend It offices,” says an FT staff member, “stood right beside Gillian, and said: ‘You work for a great magazine. Gillian is a world-class editor. But it has been a difficult time for everyone. We’re going to implement changes. And then we want to draw a line.’ He then asked for questions, but there was a stony silence.”In an age of fragmenting media, there is something old-fashioned about a single publication telling the rich how to live. Over the past dozen years, other newspapers have tried to copy the How to Spend It formula. Rival magazines and websites such as the Times’s Luxx and the Daily ’s Luxury have less clever names, but in content and format are not always easy to tell apart from the original. For now, there is enough advertising to go round: luxury magazines, being highly tactile, useful badges of status, and free of online clutter, are one of the few remaining boom areas in print media. But gauche millionaires seeking advice on shirtmakers can now shop around.In 2017, a regular survey of the luxury goods market by the management consultants Bain concluded that a “millennial state of mind” was “changing purchasing habits”, forcing companies to focus more on products that were simultaneously upmarket and downmarket, such as deliberately trashy-looking designer trainers. How to Spend It does have articles about trainers, but it prefers to write about shoes that send more reliable signals about wealth, like brogues.How to Spend It also occasionally features affordable, seemingly everyday products. In the latest issue, the Danish designer Øivind Slaatto recommends a Copenhagen restaurant for its porridge. But the need to impress is always lurking in the background. The restaurant owner, Slaatto points out, “has become a kind of rock star – he does porridge demonstrations at music festivals”. How to Spend It never stops being aware of status and nor, it implies, should its readers. For all the leisure it depicts, How to Spend It makes being rich seem hard work.In recent years, one of the places it has recommended repeatedly as a shopping destination is Mount Street in Mayfair. Once a backwater of offices and antique shops, the street has been transformed since the mid-2000s into a canyon of forbiddingly exclusive boutiques, selling designer clothes and leather goods. Staff unlock doors to let you in, then follow you solicitously but watchfully round the creamy interiors, which are a little like bank vaults, often partly subterranean and much bigger than they appear from the street.Inside the boutiques, the rest of the world recedes. There are rarely many other customers just staff waiting patiently to serve you, and walls of soft, flawless products. Mount Street is a perfect microcosm of the exquisite, sometimes airless, increasingly separate world that How to Spend It has helped construct for the rich since the 60s.But this sort of experience may no longer be what the rich desire most. An even more significant indicator of what separates them from the rest of us can be found in The Sum of Small Things, a rare clear-eyed book about the rich, published last year by Elizabeth Currid-Halkett, an American academic who studies the west’s wealthiest cities. In recent years, she argues, the rich have begun to “spend significantly less on conspicuous consumption and more on inconspicuous consumption”, such as “education, healthcare, pensions, and personal insurance”. They are buying the security and long-term elite status that are more valuable, in perilous times, than escape or pleasure.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37543db4d1e699b53e10bed23074ca9031abc522/272_331_4667_2800/master/4667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d432d381bffb7bb2473c9d4fad4785c","title":"enter dominic raab a veritable chip off the old brexit block","story":"The new Brexit secretary is showing every sign of being as clueless as his predecessor There is no sincerer form of flattery. It had been expected that the appointment of Dominic Raab to replace David Davis as Brexit secretary might raise the average IQ of the department by a few dozen points. After all, even appointing my dog – one of the dimmer creatures on this planet – would have been an improvement. But these hopes have been quickly dashed. Either there is something about the Brexit department that renders all ministers who work for it catatonically stupid or Raab is determined to live down to the standards of his predecessor. An act of kindness.What Raab does have, however, that Davis doesn’t, is a limited amount of self-awareness. He realises that the whole purpose of his job is that it’s entirely cosmetic. He’s not there to actually do anything. He’s there to give the impression that he’s doing something. The Brexit negotiations are far too complex to be left to any of the halfwits in the Brexit department. They’re also way too tricky for the prime minister and the civil service, but it’s they who are calling the shots and Raab’s main function is to do the photo-copying and make the tea. Jobs he can just about manage. At his first departmental questions, Raab immediately set about proving his lack of credentials by declaring he was very much looking forward to Michel Barnier offering “his full support” for the Chequers white paper when they met later in the day. A curious reading of the situation, given that the other EU countries have been openly sniggering about the white paper’s faults for much of the past few days and were under the impression they were currently still negotiating the withdrawal agreement. Raab hadn’t got to where he had today by knowing what he was doing. Or what was going on. The ghost of Davis past.Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer felt obliged to try a couple of questions on the viability of the Chequers agreement but he, too, was sweet-talked with meaningless circular arguments that went nowhere. A world of magical realism where everything could be simultaneously exactly the same and entirely different. Here and not here. Where there would be a Brexit idend even if the country was worse off because being worse off was a price worth paying for taking back control. It wasn’t just Labour that was getting fobbed off. Several of the hardcore Tory eurosceptics were keen to make sure ministers were making detailed plans for their preferred no-deal Brexit. Absolutely, Raab insisted. The department had started thinking about it very hard a few days previously and had already come up with some nicely-coloured wall charts that he hoped would be made available to the public at some point in the future when it would all be a bit late. But it would still all be fine even if it wasn’t. At this point, Steve Baker, the former junior Brexit minister who had been Private Walker to Davis’s Captain Mainwaring and is now a self-appointed cheerleader for Boris Johnson, intervened to ask if his one-page masterplan, entitled MY MASTERPLAN by S. BAKER. 1. Tell the EU to sod off. 2. Take back control 3. So there. 4. Panic, could be widely distributed around the department. Are you sure? Raab said. Wouldn’t it be less embarrassing if it was quietly fed through the shredder?  Baker wasn’t satisfied. It’s not enough for him to be thought an idiot. He won’t rest until he’s proved it. So he carried on, demanding also that the minister appointed a tame economist to rubbish the HMRC report that had warned even a soft Brexit was going to cost the country jobs and money. Raab said nothing. It didn’t feel the time to point out Brexit had already cost Baker his job and there was every chance it would claim those of several more ministers. The sooner the better. For their sake as well as the country’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d61c2b8257ff9b9f66894540d0e5a63afd0038/470_0_2055_1233/master/2055.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95149e3db603bfef5dbb35d482045b2b","title":"labour draws up plans for government in case of snap election","story":"Party preparing about 35 pieces of legislation to be ready to go should it win powerLabour is privately ramping up preparations for government, holding an away day on Monday where shadow cabinet members will present plans for a leftwing populist legislative programme so the party is ready for a snap general election.The event in London will lay out plans for draft Queen’s speech of up to 35 bills and a budget intended to focus on living standards and workers’ rights.Senior figures in the party such as the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have been consulting regularly with Gordon Brown to hone their plans and ensure Labour can act quickly in government.They believe they can learn from the former prime minister. “We don’t want to repeat the mistake Brown made where he was only prepared for the first 100 days and then was faced with calls for an election,” a senior Labour source said.Senior shadow ministers have been told they must turn up with six priority proposals, as well as having firm plans for legislation over the entire parliament. “We have to think much longer-term. But also we know we would be a new government that would come under attack like no other,” the source said.The party is understood to be preparing for about 35 pieces of legislation to be ready to go should it win an election. Shadow ministers have been told the plans must be popular and radical. Proposals under consideration include abolishing zero-hours contracts, a mass housebuilding programme, nationalisation of key industries, consultations on possible rent control and lifting the public sector pay cap.Sir Bob Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, has been meeting almost fortnightly with party advisers who have started preparing legislation and briefing party staff on how Whitehall operates. The party wants shadow cabinet members to know whom they would have the power to appoint on their first day in office and how civil service aides would be assigned. Labour has taken the lead in the polls as voters digest Theresa May’s new Brexit policy, outlined at Chequers, in which she has proposed following EU rules for food and goods. This week a YouGov poll put Labour five points ahead of the Tories.No general election is scheduled until 2022, but the febrile atmosphere in Westminster and the deep isions in the Conservative party have fuelled speculation that May could be left with no choice but to call an early poll. Tory remainer rebels reported on Tuesday night that whips had threatened them with the spectre of a no-confidence vote in May and an early election should they vote in favour of a customs union amendment.Most of the Labour candidates in marginal seats have been selected in preparation for any snap election, including Faiza Shaheen, the director of the Class thinktank, who will take on Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford and Woodford Green. Some have already had to step aside either because of the demands of the role or an embarrassing revelation. Mandy Richards, selected in Worcester, was dropped after it was revealed she had made “false and vexatious claims” against MI5 and MI6 and a long list of others, including her GP and Thames Water. Another candidate, Tara-Mary Lyons, was dropped after it emerged she had huge business debts that had not been disclosed to the party. Privately, party sources acknowledge that a populist policy programme in the first Queen’s speech would be essential if the party found itself as a minority government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3519e95fb34c08c9f69c7b36ba4af4cfe5941e79/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=758faeaf480f7b5ed3f73f878d619cf0","title":"the brexiters strike back politics weekly podcast","story":"Heather Stewart is joined by Jessica Elgot, Katy Balls and Jonathan Lis to discuss another febrile week of Brexit parliamentary standoffs.

But in the meantime if something comes about I’ll be happy.”Bayliss has said chief selector Ed Smith, who picked Jos Buttler based purely on white-ball form for the first Test series of the summer against Pakistan, is likely to have a conversation with Rashid to gauge his appetite for a return – potentially for the first Test at Edgbaston starting on 1 August.“That’s a decision Adil’s got to make,” said Bayliss. “I’m not sure whether Ed Smith’s had a chat with him or not. Could he get picked in the Test team on white-ball form? It’s already happened once this year. I’m sure he’ll be up for discussion, definitely.“This year is probably the best we’ve seen him bowl. His control and his consistency has been top class.”Bayliss confirmed Ben Stokes will play in the first Test against India despite fears he could be distracted by his impending court case.The all-rounder will miss the second match of the series at Lord’s as it clashes with his trial at Bristol Crown Court on a charge of affray.Given the scheduled conclusion of the Edgbaston Test is just a day before the trial starts it would be understandable if England decided to overlook Stokes.However, Bayliss said: “Ben’s the all-round package and just lifts everyone. Look, it’s not the best situation not having him there for Lord’s but we want him available for as many games as possible.”* Does not include Cricket World Cup fixturesMeanwhile, England have confirmed a schedule for next summer that includes an historic four-day first Test against Ireland.The four-day contest at Lord’s, starting on 24 July, will be England’s first Test scheduled to last fewer than five days since 1971.Ireland, who gained Test status last year and lost their first match against Pakistan in May, will act as an Ashes warm-up for England.That series against Australia, the first to be played as part of the new ICC Test Championship, will start at Edgbaston on 1 August, with further Tests at Lord’s, Headingley, Old Trafford and The Oval."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60385f0635464e98d2efdd6b8f6a61395f1291e7/0_11_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1574e2074c8a1d548c3e6c5d6ca6a971","title":"jordan spieth open golf justin rose","story":"Jordan Spieth started as he intends to go on after handing the Claret Jug back to the R\u0026ampA on Monday and saying that hopefully it will be out of his possession for only a week. He had reached three-under after 11 holes and was looking good to mount a challenge though he dropped four shots in the final four holes and left the 18th at one over.Justin Rose, one of his playing partners, drained a long putt on the last for only his second birdie of the round and the same score, though he will enjoy his evening the better after struggling in mid-round.They set out in benign conditions and Spieth completed the front nine in two-under, with a birdie from 10 feet at the 2nd and another at the 4th, as well as a decent scramble at the par‑five 6th, where he found the second of the four bunkers from the tee, pitched out in front and then came up short of the green and right. He underhit a chip which came back to him a couple of feet on the green but sank the remaining 15-footer for the ultimate in sandy pars.Rose’s serene start, four pars and a birdie, was shattered moments later by the rattle of a photographer’s shutter from behind the green as he sent a six-foot birdie putt past the hole and missed out on a second successive birdie which would have brought him level with the American at two-under. “Cameras,” he yelled as he tapped in for par having smoked his drive, Hogan style, past the bunkers on the 580-yard hole named after the American great and where Rose was entitled to have expected better.After pushing his drive right from the adjacent 7th tee he and the caddie, Mark Fulcher, remonstrated with the bank of snappers once again, their retort being “he’s gone”. So had they unsettled Rose for a few minutes and a glower at the horseshoe of a crowd behind him in the light rough after hitting short to the green and a tossed putter to Fulch after missing a 10-footer to save par after a decent chip spoke volumes.Stability of sorts was restored at the par-three 8th after he hit his tee shot through the back and did well to save par with a huge lag putt and retain parity but a double-bogey seven at the other par-five, Spectacles, left him chasing his tail.Spieth promptly produced a double at the 15th and a bogey at the par-three 16th after a poor tee-shot to hand four hours of hard work back in 20 minutes. A visit to Barry Burn with a poor tee-shot on the 18th added to the anxiety and he finished on 72, one-over.Kiradech Aphibarnrat, on the other hand, holed his third from the 17th fairway after one bounce on the green to get a round which had begun with a birdie back into some semblance of shape at three-over and give him a chance of making the cut."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6c18c13c26d218062702485245bf64181e9fd7/0_78_2688_1613/master/2688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7072c1ba6724d84f65f6ba7e80791445","title":"laura muir interview scottish runner athletics","story":"“Twenty-six seconds! 27, 28, 29!” On this Monday afternoon in St\u0026nbspMoritz, 6,000 feet up in the Swiss Alps, it is not only the Instagram-perfect views or the altitude that rips the breath away. Watching Laura Muir grind out multiple sets of 200 metres in under 30 seconds, with only half a minute to recover and refill her lungs, has a similar hypoxic effect. Finally after the 10th repetition her coach, Andy Young – part speaking clock, part drill sergeant during the session – calls time. Muir barely notices. Her head is slumped somewhere between her knees, trying to suck up the thin mountain air.Such sessions are part of Muir’s plan to peak for the European Athletics Championships next month in Berlin, where she hopes to double up in the 800m and 1500m and lay down a hefty marker for the world championships next year and the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.With Mo Farah having moved to the marathon, Muir is at the vanguard of the next wave of young British track talent crashing through. Certainly her range is extraordinary. During the past two years alone she has set a number of British and European records at distances ranging from 1,000m to 5,000m while her medal cabinet is steadily expanding. But there is something else that stands out about Muir: she speaks out.After the 1500m final at the Rio Olympics, won by Genzebe Dibaba, she admitted to having “doubts” about whether the result could be trusted. At the world indoors in March she said she no longer talks to Dibaba because of the Ethiopian’s links to Jama Aden, who is under investigation for drugs offences. Both Dibaba and Aden have denied committing any doping violations.Is she ever tempted to bite her tongue? “I think I would have a lot easier life if I didn’t say stuff,” she says, with a wry smile. “But, at the same time, people might not understand what is going on. I am honest, so I say what I feel – within\u0026nbsplimits.”Muir, who has repeatedly called for more testing in her sport, admits to receiving some abuse following her comments about Dibaba. “There was a bit. You would have to expect that. I was asked a question and I gave the answer.”And she nods when Young calls for more uniformity of testing around the world. “People should have no idea the testers are coming and the government should have no idea they are coming,” he says. “That should be the absolute basic for anyone and any country. And if the country can’t provide it, then it shouldn’t be in the sport. I don’t need to talk specifics but I am sure other people can look into which countries don’t provide that.”However, Team Muir are more reticent when discussing the brief hire of David McHenry, a strength and conditioning coach at the Nike Oregon Project – whose head coach, Alberto Salazar, is being examined by the US Anti-Doping Agency.But they insist they intended for McHenry, who is not under investigation, to help with only remote video coaching, and it is clear they were not prepared for the backlash. “Laura didn’t specifically need a strength coach,” says Young. “It\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspmore that here was someone\u0026nbspwho was the best in the world and we were looking for that quarter of a tiny per\u0026nbspcent of improvement. And there wasn’t a controversy around him.”Young, who was an excellent runner himself but has put on one or two pounds since retiring, says he may look for someone to fill the role, “although I was doing the S\u0026ampC before – and technically I have a weightlifting qualification.”At this point Muir starts to giggle. “What are you laughing at?” he asks. “Look, this belly wasn’t always there! I don’t have to lift it any more, I just give instructions.”For now Muir’s sole focus is on this weekend’s Anniversary Games in London, where she will attempt to break Zola Budd’s British one-mile record of 4min\u0026nbsp17.57sec, which has stood for 33 years. “I am really happy with my season so far,” Muir says. “I ran 3.59 for 1500m in Eugene, which was my fastest ever season opener and that was coming off the back of exams and a bit of a cold, and then did a 1.59 800m and 3.58 for 1500m back to back, so hopefully I can run even faster in London.“If I could break the British record I’d be really happy but the field is looking pretty strong,” she says, pointing out that Sifan Hassan, Jenny Simpson, Hellen Obiri and Gudaf Tsegay could help her drive past Budd’s best but also deflate her chances of victory.Having finished her veterinary studies degree at the University of Glasgow, Muir expects that being a full-time athlete will push her to greater heights – even though she is not yet running any more miles. “When you are constantly studying, you do end up quite mentally drained,” she says. “With training you can get away with it – you know what splits you have to do, so you can just get on with it. But when it comes to racing you need to be really switched on. Physically I have always been in good shape but mentally I think I will just be that little bit fresher.”Muir celebrated completing her degree by visiting a Six Flags theme park in the United States and going on the scariest roller coasters back to back. “I like to go out and see things,” she says. “With Rome it was the Coliseum, with China it was the Great Wall, while we did Christ the Redeemer and Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio.

You’re travelling the world essentially for free and you want to take it in.”And, unsurprisingly, Muir is already firming up her plans to visit Tokyo in 2020 – even though she confesses she is not always comfortable being in the public eye. “When I was growing up I never aspired to be an Olympic champion because I thought it was a bit unrealistic for me, I guess,” she says. “But for any athlete it is the pinnacle of what you want to achieve. I’d certainly love an Olympic gold medal, and I’d take the press and attention that comes with it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dfc1c42f4ef04d4277fbc94c04555850ab99b48/14_86_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0d016b36a52f740f3a5392f42e94124","title":"tour de france stage 12 report","story":"• Thomas says he is still riding for Chris Froome despite win• Froome fourth behind Tom Dumoulin and Romain BardetGeraint Thomas climbed to victory to win his second stage in a row and extend his lead in the Tour de France. Tom Dumoulin and Romain Bardet finished second and third, with Chris Froome fourth.In a dramatic final climb on Alpe d’Huez, in which spectators crowded the road knocking Vincenzo Nibali from his bike to dent his Tour chances, Thomas, Froome, Dumoulin, Bardet and Mikel Landa traded attacks in the final 5km after overhauling Steven Kruijswijk who had built up an early lead after a breakaway.At one point, a fan reached out and appeared to shove Froome as he climbed, though the Team Sky rider was not impeded.Despite attacking Froome at the end, Thomas said he was “still riding for Froomey” immediately after the race, but he has now opened a lead of 1min 39sec over the Team Sky leader, with Dumoulin 1min 50sec back and Nibali 2min 37sec behind.“I’m speechless, no chance in hell I thought I was going to win today,” said Thomas immediately after the race. “Bad luck for Nibali, I rode over his back wheel and nearly went down myself. I said yesterday that this race was made for me but after today I can be happy.”Thomas repeated his claim that he was backing Froome, saying for a second time: “I’m still riding for Froomey, he’s the man. He’s probably the best ever.” But asked if he wanted to stay in yellow, he said: “Maybe for the next few days.

He’s got a short wedge in, but sends it 30 feet past the flag. He can’t make a final birdie, though it was close, lipping out slowly, just missing on the left. He looks happy enough with his two-under 69. Francesco Molinari pars too for a one-under 70. The final member of the group, Branden Grace, made history at Birkdale last year by shooting a major-championship 62. Today it’s a 74.Another birdie for Brooks Koepka! This time at 13, and the US Open champion isn’t taking this lying down. Here’s Jamie Cadman: “Have to agree one million percent with Gary Naylor (6.12pm). I’m in Arbroath four miles away and not a soul is going. Mates in Carnoustie also not interested. And we are in golf-mad country. Horrendous pricing!”Brooks Koepka isn’t a two-time major winner for nothing. His run before the turn - 6, 5, 5, 5, 5 - would have killed off most players. But he’s bounced back with birdies at 10 and 12, the latest the result of a 30-foot right-to-left curler that was exquisitely paced. He’s +3 and smiling again. Meanwhile Tiger responds to that dropped shot at 10 by guiding in a 25-foot left-to-right slider at 11. Bounce-back birdie! He’s -2 again.Brendan Steele’s record at the Open is miserable: three previous appearances, and not a single cut survived. But he’s in good shape to break that run this week. The current Safeway Open champion isn’t too far away from rolling in a long birdie putt from the back of 18. Not quite, but after a closing run which included birdies at 14 and 17, he’s signing for a three-under 68. His playing partner Zach Johnson meanwhile has responded well to that sequence of three bogeys around the turn. Birdies at 14, then at the closing hole, see the 2015 winner scribble his name at the bottom of a two-under 69. Adam Scott makes up the group, and he birdies the last for a level-par 71.Justin Thomas manages to get up and down from the sand at 17. That’s a street-fighting par. He stays at -2. His partner Francesco Molinari also salvages something from the hole: a bogey, but it could have been much more painful had he not wedged from the rough wonderfully to four feet and holed out. He’s -1. “It’s £80 on the gate today,” reports Gary Naylor. “No wonder the crowds are thin. That’s big money by London standards, but outside London, it’s ridiculous. Shame (again) on the R\u0026ampA.”This closing stretch is beginning to take chunks out of some extremely talented players. The wind’s got up a bit, you see. Francesco Molinari has bogeyed 16, found the ditch down the left of 17, then sent his third into deep rough along the same side of the hole. Meanwhile his partner Justin Thomas also dropped a shot at 16, and needs a good up and down from a greenside bunker to save his par at 17. They’re both -2, but for how much longer? Meanwhile Tiger drops his first shot of the day, at 10, the result of finding sand from the tee. He’s -1.It’s all gone south for the world number one too. Because it’s Dustin Johnson meltdown time! He hoicks his second shot out of bounds coming up 18, then takes three putts on the green, the last one pushed wide right from short distance. A triple bogey to finish, and he’s signing for a 76. He’s +5, and already participation at the weekend looks in the balance.On 10, Sergio performs an ersatz tribute to Jean van de Velde, driving his ball into the Barry Burn, then getting in and literally splashing out. That was what van de Velde was considering on that fateful afternoon in 1999, but the tide submerged his ball at indecent speed, rendering the idea moot. Anyway, it’s a fine escape from plugged sludge - and Sergio didn’t even have to take off his shoes - but the ball squirts into a bunker, from which he can’t get up and down. Bogey, which follows a bogey at 9, and suddenly Sergio’s chances of going one better than 2007 are getting slimmer: he’s +3.Rory McIlroy wedges his second at 18 to ten feet ... but he can’t guide the left-to-right slider into the cup. That’s another chance gone begging, but he’ll be happy enough with his opening round of 69. Thorbjorn Olesen three putts to bogey the hole he’s signing for a two-under 69 too. And it’s a par for Marc Leishman, whose initially promising round crumbled to a one-over 72. Meanwhile Tiger reaches the turn in 34, without a blemish on his card.Thorbjorn Olesen hasn’t done much in the Open since his breakthrough performance at Lytham in 2012. He finished in a tie for ninth place that year. Could he go better this time? He’s certainly in good form, having won the Italian Open, tied for second at the BMW International, and finished tied sixth in Ireland. He’s going well today, at -2, and he’s only one turn of the ball short of another birdie at 17. Meanwhile a late move up the leaderboard by the hotly tipped Francesco Molinari. The Italian is in excellent nick too, after winning the BMW PGA and coming second to Olesen in his home open. Having just birdied 13 and 15, he’s -3.Sign up! Now! Please! If you like!Henrik Stenson rattles in a missable par putt on 18, and he’s signing for a one-under 70. A strong finish to the 2016 champion’s round. Hubert O’Hearn again: “As soon as I criticise someone in golf or football, they’re going to bomb in either a long putt or an absurd volley. I really should hang out a shingle. You’re right that you can’t straddle the line of the putt. Sam (and I) had the ball just off my right foot, so a very very very open stance. And frankly, the USGA and R\u0026ampA can lump it as far as criticism goes. This game is hard enough without disallowing a little ingenuity.”Turf accountancy’s Sean Ingle (4.13pm) look away! Your man Marc Leishman is doing a number on you! That stumble around the turn really did take the wind out of his sails: he’s now bogeyed 12, 14 and 16 to drop to +1. Going in the right direction: Sergio, with birdie at 6 to rise to +1, and Big Dustin, who is on the same mark after birdie at 14.Rory McIlroy curls in a right-to-left par saver from the edge of the par-three 16th. He’s hanging on in there at -2. Apologies to Hubert O’Hearn, then, for the awkward timing of this email: “The Open naturally breeds nostalgic memory and Rory’s putting difficulties caused me to remember Sam Snead’s side saddlecroquet stroke. I can speak from personal experience that it works, in much the same way that the now illegal ‘chin’ putter works. I wonder why no one uses it since Snead? I only quit putting side saddle because people gave me strange looks. I never again putted well. But I’ll tell you, to win a million pounds? I’d put up with all kinds of strange looks.” I stand to be corrected, so don’t quote me on this, but the croquet stroke is banned however side saddle is fine so long as players don’t straddle the line of the putt. But the authorities don’t like it much. Bryson DeChambeau copped a lot of heat from the USGA when he tried it.Tiger can’t convert his big drive on 6 into birdie. A distinctly average 7-iron into the green stymies his chances. On 18, Ryan Moore pars to finish with a 68. And if you thought Brooks Koepka had already hit a wall, his round is seriously unravelling now. His tee shot at the par-three 8th dribbles into a bunker. He’s forced to play out while outside the trap, on his knees. Inevitably, the ball only just gets over the face, and topples back into the sand. He can’t get the next one out. Third time lucky, to a couple of feet. But that’s a second double bogey in four holes. The double US Open champion has just gone 6-5-5-5. Having looked in total control of his game at the start of his round, he’s now tumbled to +4. Links golf, ladies and gentlemen!An eagle for Bryson DeChambeau on 6. That takes him up the leaderboard to -1. He’s alongside Padraig Harrington, the winner here in 2007: the three-time major winner has sandwiched a bogey at 5 with birdies at 3 and 8. And Brooks Koepka’s frustrations continue: a yip from close range on 7, and he’s just gone 6-5-5. He’s +2. “Whenever I see McIlroy ruining his chances by putting like an 18 handicapper, I’m always reminded of Lee Westwood in the last round of the 2012 Masters,” writes Chris Miners. “Everyone remembers Louis Oosthuizen’s albatross, but fewer remember that Westwood missed makeableeasy putts on literally every single hole on the back nine that day. Imperious from tee to green. Hapless with the putter. Which wouldn’t sting so much if he hadn’t lost by just two shots. Jordan Spieth would have made at least four of those putts.”Tiger takes driver for the first time today, at the long par-five 6th. And that’s a controlled effort as well, splitting the fairway, and long. Way too early to get properly excited ... but let’s allow ourselves to get a little excited, what’s the point of sport if we’re not allowed? The early signs are promising for the 2000, 2005 and 2006 champion. A serious challenge could be forthcoming! Speaking of which ... Rory McIlroy has just made another birdie, this time on the par-five 14th. He had been pin high with a fairly straight 25-footer for eagle, so the flat stick isn’t quite behaving perfectly yet. But he’s -2 now, and in a much better frame of mind.Brooks Koepka’s misery continues. He blooters a huge drive down the left of the par-five 6th, but his second finds sand, and though he splashes out well to eight feet, the birdie putt lips out. He’s just gone 6-5 after a brisk start. Meanwhile what a par save by Tiger on 5! He’s on the wrong side of the swale, and elects to putt through it, down and up. There’s a massive right-to-left break as well. And he hits it perfectly - or as near as dammit. He’s one dimple away from making a jaw-dropping birdie ... but the ball teeters on the edge and stubbornly refuses to disappear. For a second, you wonder whether there’s going to be a crowd-teasing pause, then a crowd-pleasing topple into the cup, a la the 16th at Augusta in 2005. But no. Tiger surveys the scene in a 360-degree sweep, but that ball’s not dropping. He taps it in. So unlucky! But so brilliant. Tiger’s in the mood, folks. That was his first error of the day, and he’s passed the resulting test with flying colours.“Ti-gerrrrrrr!” Woods admonishes himself as he makes his first mistake of the day, pushing his second at 5 down a swale to the right of the green. He’ll have a chance of getting up and down from there, but there’s not a lot of green to play with. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for Henrik Stenson, at 14 and 15, and suddenly the 2016 champion is in red figures.Rory McIlroy misses another makeable birdie putt, this time at 13. He remains at -1. Dustin Johnson continues to go the wrong way: bogey at 12, and he’s +2. And Zach Johnson has tumbled back down the leaderboard: bogeys at 8, 9 and 10 have him clattering back to level par for the tournament.Tiger makes his birdie putt! The very picture of grace and serenity right now. He’s -2. If he sticks to his gameplan and keeps going like this, there’s a very real chance of a repeat of his measured win at Hoylake. Just the 68 holes to go. Birdie for Ryan Moore on 16 he returns to -3.Rory finally gets his putter working! He rolls in a left-to-right slider from 30 feet on 12, and suddenly he’s in the red again, with a little bit of spring in his step for the first time in a while. On 5, Koepka elects to putt down from the top of a huge bank - there’s no rough in between - and requires a couple of stewards to hold up some TV cables running along the ground. He sends his putt barrelling under the cables, down onto the green, and miles past the hole. He’s got a 40-footer coming back for his par. He can’t make it ... and then he pulls his short bogey putt left! A double, from prime position in the middle of the fairway. That was a very weird second shot. And it’s cost him. He’s back to +1.Tiger toys with disaster at 4. Taking another iron for safety, he sends his ball hurtling towards the ditch running down the left of the hole. For a second it looked sure to drop into the hazard, but the camber of the fairway took the ball back to safety at the last. That’s a huge break. And he grasps the situation with both hands, wedging delightfully to three feet, setting up a wonderful birdie chance. Ahead on 5, a very strange shot by Brooks Koepka, who from the centre of the fairway launches his approach miles over the green. That’s quite odd. He doesn’t know his own strength. He’s got a lie on flat ground, but he’s high above the green, and it’ll take quite a chip to get close from there.Tiger pars 2, then 3, in pretty much the same style: a conservative iron from the tee, a controlled approach that sets up a half-chance, and a putt that doesn’t quite drop. At -1 he seems happy enough with the way things are going so far, not least because his partners Hideki Matsuyama and Russell Knox are struggling along at +1 and +2 respectively. Meanwhile Sergio’s dream of redemption for 2007 is that little bit further out of reach: he’s followed bogey at 1 with another at 3: he’s +2. “I’m on Leishman to be first round leader at 50-1, six places each way.” The latest dispatch there from our senior sports writer Sean Ingle. “That double bogey on 10 was like a hard toepunt to the swingers.” When the fun stops, Seanie ...Marc Leishman responds to dropping three strokes in two holes by making birdie at 11. He’s back to -2. Justin Thomas rattles in a monster across 9, and he’s turning in a blemish-free 33. And up on 18, Zander Lombard pars and signs for a 67, one off Kevin Kisner’s clubhouse lead.One of the shots of the day from Rory McIlroy! He’s waist-deep in total nonsense down the left of 11. Surely all he’ll be able to do is hack out? But he lashes at the ball, scythes through the tall grass, and from 100 yards out, bumps it up, pin high, to four feet! That’s glorious! And then he yips the short birdie putt. McIlroy’s putting is little short of abysmal these days, unreliable enough to suggest he’ll never win another major unless he sorts it. The flat stick certainly cost him the Masters this year cast your mind back to Sunday, and that eagle chance on 2. On Sky, Butch Harmon suggests he’s way too mechanical now and needs to get back to basics quicksmart.Brooks Koepka batters another huge drive, this time over the back of 3, and chips back to 12 feet. His birdie putt horseshoes out. He stays at -1, all the while looking very dangerous indeed. Meanwhile it’s a double bogey for Marc Leishman at 10 he slips back into the pack at -1, having been a shot off the lead a few minutes ago. “Well that’s Tiger gone won it, then, isn’t it?” suggests Simon Farnaby, co-author of the screenplay for Paddington 2 as well as this slightly less successful venture. “Considering he usually triple-bogeys the first in majors? I’m not even joking. Can’t remember the last time he opened with a birdie. The less said about Sergio the better.” Yes, probably a wise move, this is a family newspaper after all.Dustin Johnson responds to bogey on the par-three 8th by crashing a 408-yard drive down 9. Then he seriously overcooks his chip. He can’t make the 25-footer coming back, and that’s a frustrating par. After that mammoth tee shot! He turns in 37. Up on 10, Leishman’s round is beginning to unravel after missing that short par putt on the previous hole: he sends his tee shot into rough down the right, then finds the burn up the hole on the same side. That’s a dreadful shot. He’ll do well to stem the bleeding here.Hideki Matsuyama is this close to birdie at 1, but his 25-foot right-to-left slider stops one turn short of the cup. He clacks his tongue in annoyance. His partner Russell Knox isn’t much happier, having taken an unfortunate kick to find a greenside bunker forced to splash out sideways, in and out of the trap, on one knee, he ends up with bogey. But the third player in the group - one T Woods - rolls his birdie putt confidently into the centre of the cup! That’s a perfectly played opening hole, and the 14-time major winner has begun his quest for that elusive number 15 in style!Tiger has some tape on the back of his neck. According to Rich Beem on Sky, it’s nothing serious, he “just slept on it funny”. Admittedly it’s a small sample size, but it’s certainly not causing him any problems so far, as he wedges his second to 12 feet. Meanwhile on 9 it’s a three-putt bogey for Marc Leishman, who drops back to -3. And up on 18, Tony Finau curls in a big right-to-lefter for a birdie and a 67!Oh Sergio! A perfect tee shot at the opening hole. Then he pushes his second long and right, chunks a chip coming back, and ends up with an utterly needless bogey. What a start. Back up the hole, Tiger’s out on the prowl and, reprising the tactic that won him the 2006 event at Hoylake, clips an iron 258 yards down the track. Meanwhile Rory reaches the turn in level par."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d71a3026ddf5984df15de50694048f32590ef7/0_0_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=166c42baee3213446e7738c579bc81cf","title":"tour de france 2018 race heads to alpe dhuez on stage 12 live","story":"Geraint Thomas became the first Briton, and the first yellow jersey wearer, to win on the Alpe d’Huez after a phenomenal and brutal stageAnd with that, I’m done. It’s been a spectacular day. I’ll be back for more tomorrow. See you then!Some boos as Thomas climbs the podium, with Team Sky controversial in France. He then has another chat:I did not think that was going to happen, even on the climb. The plan was for Froome to have a go, and for me to follow. I knew round that last corner we had to be first, with Froome on my wheel. I thought, just go round. If anyone’s going to go round me, it’ll be him. With 50m to go, I thought, no way is this actually happening.I think he got caught with a spectator or something. He crashed right in front of me. I managed to stay up. Not nice for him, for sure. That’s the only negative of the day. And Kruijswijk, that was some ride. I can’t believe I won the stage. Just unreal. Here’s our first-take report on today’s action:At that point you’re not even racing, you’re just trying to get to the top. There’s nothing left in the legs. I felt really good on the first climb today but it was such a hard day, after such a hard week last week. I did my best today, so I’m happy. I’m just tired.This is from the Wall Street Journal’s Joshua Robinson:This is how it ended:That was an enthralling stage from first to last, and it ends with Geraint Thomas extending his lead to 1min 39sec. And this is what he has to say about it:Honestly I’m speechless. I don’t know what to say. Not a chance in hell I thought I was going to win today. I just followed Dumoulin and Bardet. Obviously a bit of bad luck for Nibali. I nearly went down myself. It’s just unbelievable. Can we just go to Paris now? I did say yesterday, this race is made for me now. Today, that’s it. I can be happy for sure now. Maybe I can keep the yellow jersey for the next few days, but this race is so hard. You never know how the body reacts. But I’m still riding for Froomey. He’s a legend, probably the best ever. I’m just going to enjoy this. It’s great. I can’t believe it. Alpe d’Huez, man. Speechless.Here’s the top 10, with Kruijswijk in fact 10th: Kruijswijk somehow clung on to the leaders and finished, I think, in a ludicrously commendable seventh.A fascinating, engrossing race ends with the yellow jersey crossing the line first!180m to go: Thomas is in the lead and sprinting hard!660m to go: Landa goes! And Thomas goes with him!1km to go: Landa has caught up again! So it’s one of five for the stage win.1.5km to go: So after 174km and a variety of enormous climbs, who’s got a sprint finish in reserve?1.8km to go: Now the four are back together. This is anyone’s stage still!2km to go: Thomas goes with Dumoulin, but Froome is left behind!2.1km to go: Bardet attacks again! He gets away briefly, but Froome chases him down. And then Dumoulin goes!2.7km to go: The race has turned tactical, with none of the leading four wanting to go for broke. This is giving others a chance to join them at the front, with Mikel Landa on the verge of doing so. 3km to go: There’s now a front four of Bardet, Dumoulin, Froome and Thomas. 3.3km to go: And Froome takes the lead! Tom Dumoulin is behind him, with Thomas on his wheel.3.6km to go: Geraint Thomas puts on a blast at the front of the chasing pack, helping Froome up the hill. Kruijswijk’s lead really is vanishing now, with Froome approaching!3.8km to go: Nibali is down! I’m not sure what happened, but there appeared to be a sudden throng of motorbikes blocking the way.4km to go: The riders are, according to tradition, being occasionally accosted by lunatics in weird costumes. One such runs alongside Bardet for a while, before being tackled round the neck by a yellow-jacketed security guard. “Wondering if there’s some kind of summer circuit for the biggest halfwits in Europe that takes them from the Running Of The Bulls in Pamplona to Alpe d’Huez a week or so later,” writes Jutin Horton. “And where do they go next?”4.5km to go: Bardet’s attack is strong, and he’s (apparently) less than a minute behind Kruijswijk now. 5km to go: We’re not seeing much of Kruijswijk, with cameras focused on the yellow jersey, and on Bardet. His lead, we’re told, is 1min 11sec.5.5km to go: Quintana is already 30sec behind the yellow jersey group, and falling fast.6km to go: The official timing is all over the place. Now Kruijswijk has a lead of 1min 51sec. And in between starting that sentence and finishing it it went down to 1min 38sec. It’s anyone’s guess, frankly.6.4km to go: Quintana has been dropped by the group of favourites, and seems to be struggling!6.7km to go: Romain Bardet attacks, and he gets away from Bernal! Kruijswijk’s lead is apparently down to 1min 33sec. 7km to go: “Well Egan Bernal will win a Grand Tour or two before he’s finished, won’t he?” wonders Gary Naylor. He’s extremely impressive, and at just 21 has plenty of time. Plus when he cycled into a car it hurt the car more than him.7.6km to go: Egan Bernal neutralises the Quintana attack as well, and remains at the front of the chasing group.8km to go: Thomas has retaken the virtual yellow jersey, with an 8sec margin over Kruijswijk. The Dutchman’s lead is 2min 33sec. 8.5km to go: Nibali’s attack didn’t amount to much, but now Nairo Quintana has a go! 9km to go: Kruijswijk is precisely 1km ahead, his lead now at 2min 54sec. He retains the virtual yellow jersey, but is 14 seconds away from losing it.9.3km to go: And Vincenzo Nibali attacks! 9.5km to go: So the gap isn’t closing as swiftly as it had appeared, but it is still closing. It’s at 3min 15sec, and falling gently.10.4km to go: No it isn’t! It’s the TV timings that are bust, rather than Kruijswijk’s legs. The graphic on the top of the TV screen suddenly updates, and Kruijswijk’s lead, which had been down below 2min, is suddenly back up to 3min 28sec. 10.5km to go: Kruijswijk’s lead is evaporating!11km to go: Domestiques are being used up and spat out as the favourites mount their chase. Egan Bernal is leading the group at the moment, and what a pace he’s setting: Kruijswijk’s lead is suddenly down to 2min 20sec!11.7km to go: So 14 of the top 15 in the GC standings are in the 30-man group leading the chase. The other is 3min 45sec ahead.13km to go: Geraint Thomas is 1.5km behind the leader, and girding his loins for the big climb. Kruijswijk still looks astonishingly fresh. 13.5km to go: Kruijswijk reaches the bottom of the Alpe d’Huez, and starts to climb.14km to go: The three-man chasing pack of Barguil, Majka and Nieve has been caught by the peloton, which is 4min 20sec behind Kruijswijk.16.5km to go: The leader goes through Bourg d’Oisans, home of the Museum of the Geology and Fauna of the Alps. Among the highlights is a “recreation of the landscape and life in the Mesozoic through four large frescoes”. The road here is astonishingly flat and phenomenally straight.20km to go: Rob Betts has more on Kruijswijk: “While not amongst the main favourites, he clearly has pedigree and if it sticks this could be considered one of the great modern GT stage wins, and would definitely have Sky concerned for the overall,” he writes. “He’s a good at the chrono too.” Kruijswijk has never won a stage on a grand tour. His lead over the yellow jersey group is 4min 50sec.23km to go: The lead is down to 5min 5sec. At this stage if Kruijswijk holds onto this lead it would be phenomenal, and if he’s chased down it would be brilliantly dramatic. There’ll be no losers in this race (well, not among those of us who are only watching it). 26km to go: That’s despite Robert Gesink, Kruijswijk’s team-mate, moving to the front of the Team Sky group to disrupt their chase for a while.

The letter is the first step in a legal process that could lead to Hungary being taken to the European court of justice (ECJ) and told to change the law.Separately, the commission said it was referring Hungary to the ECJ for breaking other EU asylum rules, linked to the country’s detention camps for asylum seekers.The announcements are a sign of the deepening standoff between Brussels and Viktor Orbán, who was re-elected in April for a fourth term as Hungary’s prime minister, after a campaign dominated by charged rhetoric against migrants.Weeks after Orbán’s resounding victory, Hungary passed laws making it a criminal offence for iniduals and non-governmental organisations to help asylum claimants and migrants. Known informally as the Stop Soros law, the government wants to draw a link between migrants and the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who is demonised by the ruling party, partly for his funding of NGOs.Last month the Council of Europe’s Venice committee of constitutional experts raised the alarm about the law, saying it lacked precision and meant organisations were at risk of prosecution “even if they acted in good faith” in line with international law. The law was also deemed contrary to the European convention on human rights on the grounds of freedom of expression, because of provisions that criminalise “preparing or distributing informational materials”.Following this negative opinion, the commission’s decision was a foregone conclusion. It found the law in breach of several EU laws and the EU’s charter of fundamental rights.Hungary’s government has two months to respond to the charge sheet and it could be referred to the ECJ if the dispute is unresolved.That outcome looks very likely, underlined by the commission’s announcement that it was referring Hungary to the court over a separate dispute on asylum law. It said the majority of its concerns had not been met. Hungary has built a steel fence along its southern borders and has kept asylum seekers in converted shipping containers while they wait for their cases to be heard.EU law does not ban such centres, but the commission said Hungary was breaching the EU’s maximum processing time of four weeks and failing to provide effective asylum procedures. Asylum seekers risk being returned to their country of origin even if they face persecution there, in breach of the non-refoulement principle of international law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df80def323bf39938699f49b2dc958a2d7177ce/0_94_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e31ca5b01b262b70f25baf2a413ac012","title":"three mummies egyptian black granite sarcophagus alexandria","story":"Archaeologists open granite tomb but are dismayed at state of decay after ‘sewage leak’Egyptian archeologists have opened a 30-tonne black granite sarcophagus to find three decomposed mummies after sewage water apparently leaked inside. “The sarcophagus has been opened, but we have not been hit by a curse,” said Mostafa Waziry, the head of Egypt’s Supreme Council for Antiquities, in response to news reports warning of maledictions hidden inside the tomb in the port city of Alexandria. Waziry, accompanied by a team of specialists in mummification and restoration, instead found three mummies and a red liquid he identified as sewage water, believed to have entered the sarcophagus through a crack on its right side, causing the decomposition of the mummies. The tomb was found buried five metres beneath the surface and the help of Egyptian military engineers was required to open the 15-tonne lid. After capturing the world’s attention because of its unusually large size, observers believed it could contain the remains of a prominent figure, with some considering the possibility that it could contain the corpse of Alexander the Great. The sarcophagus, almost three metres across and two metres high, is believed to date from the early Ptolemaic period, which began following the death of Alexander in 323BC.It was found during construction work in Egypt’s northernmost city, accompanied by a weathered alabaster head thought to depict one of the occupants of the tomb. Archeologists were excited because a layer of mortar beneath the lid suggested it had remained untouched since it was buried thousands of years ago. The skulls of the three mummies found inside will now be analysed in order to identify their ages and cause of death. Shaaban Abdel Amonem, one of the specialists in mummification who attended the opening, said initial assessments showed the trio were probably soldiers, with one of the skulls displaying evidence of arrow blows.  Waziri said the lack of death masks in precious metals, amulets, statuettes or inscriptions on the sarcophagus meant the bodies were unlikely to be those of Ptolemaic or Roman royals. Video footage from the news website Youm7 showed a man pouring the red liquid into the street, after samples were taken to be analysed.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA bird forced a plane bound for New York to circle over the coast near Bray before returning to Dublin Airport. Norwegian Airlines flight D81842 to New York reported a bird-strike during its take-off roll shortly after departing Dublin at approximately 8:36am.The plane then flew out over Galway before returning to the east coast, where it entered a holding pattern for around three hours in order to burn off fuel before attempting a landing. Siobhán O’Donnell, from Dublin Airport Authority, confirmed that the incident took place, and also confirmed that the plane landed safely at around 12:20pm. As a precaution, Airport Fire Services followed the plane until it had completed its landing. A Norwegian Airlines spokesperson said: “Today’s flight D81842 from Dublin to New York returned safely back to Dublin Airport following a suspected bird strike. The safety and security of our passengers and crew is our highest priority and passengers have disembarked the aircraft as normal”. Birds are a common risk to planes and have been known to cause accidents when collisions occur, although serious incidents only happen with larger birds. Of 21,380 occurrences reported between 2011 and 2014, bird strikes were the second most common reason, only behind system failures and malfunctions. Staff at Dublin Airport have tried numerous ways to keep birds away from the runways and reduce the number of bird strikes. These have included a fake fox on the runway, kites with pictures of birds of prey on them, and even a small gas cannon to frighten the birds with noise. These efforts may be paying off, as the 2016 Annual Safety Review of Aviation in Ireland did not list bird strikes in the top-three causes of reported incidents. In fact, 2016 only saw 56 bird strikes at the airport, down from around 70 the previous year. There was a slight rise in the numbers of strikes in 2017, up to 60. However, Ms. O’Donnell insisted that these numbers are very small when the amount of air traffic going through Dublin Airport was considered. “When you take it that we had 223,197 aircraft landings and take-offs last year so the number is small in the overall size of the planes landing and taking-off. “That said this is an area that we take very seriously and we invest a lot of time and effort in deterring birds from nesting and flying across the airfield”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3570370.1532014679!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cost to hse of recruiting 371 staff a month not sustainable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe review  says that HSE estimates on expenditure on agency staff have been “consistently out of line” with actual spending. Photograph: Brenda FitzsimonsCurrent levels of recruitment in the health service - running at 371 staff per month - are not sustainable when combined with the ongoing cost of pay deals and other health service pressures such as pharmaceuticals, a new Government spending review has found. The review also says that HSE estimates on expenditure on agency staff have been “consistently out of line” with actual spending ranging from €52 million to €154 million above the projected level from 2015 to 2017. It says it appears that assumptions underpinning agency pay profiles are “not realistic or achievable”. The review suggests that staffing levels for doctors and nurses is back beyond the levels in place in 2009 when calculated per 1,000 of population. The review says the number of personnel employed in the HSE across all grades increased by 14,213 whole time equivalents (WTE) or 15 per cent between the beginning of 2014 and the end of 2017. It says there has also been a substantial increase in recruitment in the early part of this year with 1,482 staff taken on or a monthly average of 371.However it says that the health budget for 2018 only provided for an additional 1,800 staff to be hired -- or around 150 WTEs per month. “If this recruitment rate continues for the remainder of 2018 and 2019, it is expected that this would add €235million to the pay bill in 2018 and €250million in 2019. This would result in an increase in direct pay spend of €485million by end 2019. Going forward, this monthly recruitment level does not appear sustainable when combined with the cost of pay deals and other health service pressures such as pharmaceuticals.”The spending review says that the 2018 health budget allocated an additional €494million for current expenditure. It warns that if recruitment continues at between 150 WTEs to 371 WTEs per month, it will cost an estimated additional €359 million to €396 million this year .“This would mean that 73 per cent to 80 per cent of the total current health budget would be spent on pay. This is beyond the pay bill budget and would only leave €98million to €135million of the additional budget (current expenditure) available to fund all other cost pressures in 2018. The review says from 2015 to 2017 the largest number of the additional staff taken on were recruited into acute services with 3,868 personnel taken on. “ While the greatest number of additional staff were directed toward acutes, in terms of percentage growth in the staff numbers the service area which experienced the greatest percentage growth is health and wellbeing with a 13 per cent increase in staffing over the 2 year period. The areas with the lowest percentage growth in staff were primary care and mental health with 4 percent each. It suggests this is contrary to official health policy. The review says that compared to other OECD countries Ireland has a relatively low number of doctors per 1,000 population. “It can be seen that Ireland’s international position did not change over the period 2009 to 2015 despite a number of policy changes in the area of recruitment. In 2015, the number of doctors per 1,000 population in Ireland has now moved past 2009 levels.”“Contrary to findings on doctors per capita, Ireland has a considerable number of nurses per capita compared to other OECD countries. Ireland is in the higher quadrant of OECD countries when comparing the number of nurses per 1,000 population. When looking at the change in the same metric over time it can be seen that the number of nurses per 1,000 population in 2015 is almost back at the same level experienced in 2009. Given that recent increases in staff numbers have been beyond growth in demographics, it is expected that this rate will now have moved beyond 2009 levels.”The review maintains the ratio of nurses to doctors in Ireland -- at 3.8 -- is high compared to other countries."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3570393.1532015026!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"wedding ring lost on donegal beach found by children building sand castles","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSisters Maisie (3) and Lola Busch (6) from Lisburn who while on their holidays in Portsalon, Co Donegal, found the lost wedding ring. Photograph: Donna El Assaad When Donegal man Gary Crossan lost his cherished wedding ring while swimming off the beach at Portsalon, Co Donegal, at the end of June the chances of finding it must have seemed like a million to one shot.Gary, who works as development officer for Triathlon Ireland, noticed the ring missing from his finger on Friday evening, June 29th, after spending much of the day on the beach with his family.“I went for a swim and jumped in off the pier and when I came back in I realised that the wedding ring was gone. We combed the beach as best we could but I pretty much thought it was a lost cause,” he said.After almost three weeks Gary had understandably virtually given up hope until, against all expectations, he was alerted to a Facebook post earlier this week that read: “I found this gold wedding ring last week on Portsalon beach near the pier. It has ‘Maria’ and a date engraved inside. Please share - would be great to get it back to its owner. Thanks”.Days after the post went live, it was spotted by Gary’s brother-in-law Anthony Sheridan.“He tagged me in the post ... (on Wednesday) and I made contact with the lady last night. I was able to tell her the date engraved inside (201203).“We’re married nearly fifteen years and the ring is of great sentimental value. It just goes to show the power of social media. I wouldn’t be a big fan but it can do good some time, like on this occasion,” he said.“I honestly thought that it would be impossible to find. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack and all I can say is thank you to Ann and her two young daughters for finding my ring,” he added.Ann Busch who is originally from Carlow but now lives in Lisburn, Co Antrim, with her husband Gary and their two young daughters Lola (6) and Maisie (3) was holidaying in Portsalon when her children found the ring.“We were building a sand castle on the beach last week and when we put the spade into the sand we dug up the ring. The girls were all excited to find a treasure at the beach but I explained to them that this was someone else’s romantic story,” she said.“I lost my engagement ring a few days after my husband, who’s also called Gary, proposed. It was lost in a frosty garden and it took us days to find it.

Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDUP MP Ian Paisley apologises to the House of Commons in London for failing to register two family holidays funded by the Sri Lankan government, which he previously estimated was worth £50,000. Photograph: PA WireDUP MP Ian Paisley has made an emotional statement to the House of Commons, apologising for his failure to declare two luxury holidays that were paid for by the Sri Lankan government. A parliamentary watchdog has called for the North Antrim MP to be suspended for 30 sitting days because he failed to declare the holidays, which were worth more than £50,000. The trips also included meeting with Sri Lankan governmental figures. The threshold for registering such hospitality in 2013 was around £660. He subsequently wrote a letter to the prime minister arguing on behalf of the Sri Lankan government. Mr Paisley has faced calls to resign his seat and there is a prospect of a by-election as a consequence of the sanction. At times struggling to maintain his composure, Mr Paisley apologised to the House, to his colleagues in the DUP and to his constituents.“I take my duties as a Member of Parliament seriously. I believe that I conduct myself with colleagues with integrity and openness, which is why I have such remorse about the matter, as I believe it goes against the grain of who I am, especially how it is portrayed,” he said.“It is to my constituents, who have sent me here since 2010, that I make the profoundest of all apologies. They have honoured me with unwavering support to be their voice and I hope that they will continue to have that confidence in me in the future.”When the Daily  broke the story of Mr Paisley’s holidays in Sri Lanka, where he was accompanied by his family, he initially denied the reports and threatened to sue the newspaper. The holidays included business-class air travel, accommodation at first-class hotels, helicopter trips and visits to tourist attractions for Mr Paisley and his family.Mr Paisley said that mistakes made by those in public life were amplified and that they ought to be.“That is the nature of the job that all of us do and all of us understand that. However, I believe in a politics and in politicians who can admit to human frailty, who can apologise, mean it, and move on, because that is what real life is all about,” he said.“It is often said that it is how we respond to these challenges in our lives that defines who and what we are, and defines our character and demonstrates to us where the true source of our personal strength rests. The 8th-century prophet Isaiah said, ‘You were angry with me, that anger has turned away, you comfort me.’ I hope to learn that lesson.”The Commons Standards Committee on Wednesday outlined the sanction for Mr Paisley, son of late DUP founder the Rev Ian Paisley, saying he had committed “serious misconduct” and his actions “were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute”.Mr Paisley’s potential suspension would start in September if MPs approve it.Members who are suspended from the Commons for more than 10 days are open to a recall petition. A by-election would be triggered if 10 per cent of the electorate in Mr Paisley’s North Antrim constituency sign that petition.– PA"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

which are in urban areas. The internet speed, seen as the benchmark for fast broadband in the future, is also offered by some providers as hyperoptic broadband and outstrips the superfast and ultrafast speeds commonly offered by mainstream internet companies. Many of the areas with the fastest broadband in the country are in remote areas, including rural parts of of Lancashire and Oxfordshire. Some northern areas are covered by B4RN, or Broadband for the Rural North, a community-led organisation that offers the fast connection to households in its coverage area for £30 a

pooled their resources in 2011 to fund the project.However, rural areas are still neglected, with a recent report by the Local Government Association warning that residents outside cities were struggling with slow speeds. According to Ofcom, rural areas make up most of the five per cent of homes which are still unable to access superfast broadband, which is usually at speeds of anything up to 80Mb.The Government pledged to ensure that 95 per cent of homes would be able to access these speeds by the end of December last year. In January then-secretary of state for digital culture, media and sport Matt Hancock said the £1.7 billion programme had been successful. The extremely fast gigabit broadband requires fibre optic cables to be laid directly to be the building which is to be connected to the network. This differs from standard superfast broadband, which involves fibre optic cables being laid to the street cabinet with older copper cables making up the rest of the distance to the home. The National Infrastructure Commission has also warned that some rural areas risk being left out of plans to roll out high-speed fibre broadband across the country.The Commission\u0027s report, published earlier this month, also said that copper wires should be switched off within seven years, and a full fibre internet network should be rolled out by 2033.Last month it urged the Government to subsidise its installation in areas where it is less economically viable for private companies. The  has been campaigning for better broadband in line with modern business and social requirements which mean it is an indispensible utility.Rural businesses have said they are being held back by an inability to access fast, reliable internet, which limits their ability to set up online shops and communicate with clients and customers. The FT said its data was based on Ofcom\u0027s information and relates to the speeds that households were actually accessing. Openreach said 17.5m homes and businesses were able to upgrade to faster broadband services.Spiky Utah dinosaur had more than \u0026#39a face only a mother could love\u0026#39Spain withdraws arrest warrant for

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, co-founder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The nature of our future trading relationship with the European Union straddles so many Tory totems from the role of business to the European Court of Justice to the border with Ireland. As a consequence an internal party “deal”\u0026nbspthat took two years to put together fell apart within two days and now we are once more the laughing stock of Europe with only a matter of months before we leave.Reforging 40 years of economic, political and societal links in a constructive, inclusive and forward-looking way would be a challenge for any government but is clearly far beyond the capacity of this one. As a government in waiting, it is Labour’s job not only to hold the government to account but to set out what our approach would be. This is the work that Keir Starmer and Labour’s Brexit team has undertaken, exemplified by the amendments our party tabled to the Great Repeal Bill. But it is also my job as shadow minister for industrial strategy to consider what Brexit means for our economic future and to place decisions in that context. And that has to mean an economic future that\u0026nbspincludes everyone, and does not merely carry over the regional and social ides that helped deliver the referendum result in the first place.To achieve this we need to look back even as we look forward. And to look outwards to the world even as we consider how best to maintain a close relationship with the European Union.The industrial landscape of Britain today is the product of a succession of industrial strategies or non-strategies, each of which was ultimately unable to deal with the reality of the larger world economy. Britain entered the 20th century hoping to maintain its position as the supplier of manufactured goods to the largest empire the world had ever known, a strategy that could not be sustained given the scale of US industry and the understandable desire of the rest of the Empire to build its own industrial base. By the 1960s, British industry was increasingly focused on our domestic market, but even that more limited “strategy”\u0026nbspproved untenable in the face of more efficient and larger scale foreign competition from the United States, Japan, Germany, Korea\u0026nbspand ultimately China.In response, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher and her successors, and to a lesser extent the 1997 Labour government, pursued a kind of “anti-industrial strategy”. This substituted first North Sea oil and then City of London financial services for industrial competitiveness. North Sea oil was a finite national asset that delivered the expected temporary economic boost. The impact of our burgeoning financial sector was more complex. It brought substantial benefits in jobs, revenues and social capital, particularly to London. It also drove the “financialisation”\u0026nbspof our economy.Financialisation\u0026nbsp– the anti-industrial strategy The way in which financialisation proved to be an anti-industrial strategy is admirably set out in leading economist Mariana Mazzucato’s new book The Value of Everything. In it she describes the “two faces of financialisation”.The first of these is the way in which the financial sector has stopped resourcing the real economy – instead of investing in companies that produce “stuff”, finance is financing finance. Why lend money to a manufacturer that may fail when you can make a bet on some options hedged with other options that virtually guarantee a return in a few weeks? The owner of a medium-sized manufacturing business gave me a striking example of this recently. His high-street bank was initially supportive when he requested a loan for new manufacturing equipment, which would significantly boost productivity. Once the bank realised that the equipment would not be something they could sell on should he go bankrupt, their interest drained away entirely. It was willing to lend based on liquidation value, but was not willing to take a risk on a living business. In a financialised economy, capital tends to flow towards standardised securities rather than actual operating businesses that present bespoke risks.But it is not only financial capital that is erted from the real economy. Human capital is sucked in too. When I graduated from Imperial College in 1987, I would estimate that only about 10 per cent of my electrical engineering cohort went into industry. The majority went into management consultancy and finance, which paid better as well as having clearer career paths. Recently the dean of an engineering department told me that was still the case and asked how I could expect engineers to go into engineering when finance paid so much better and was quite honestly the only way a graduate engineer could ever hope to buy a home in London.I responded that they should come to Newcastle where not only could they buy a lovely home on an engineer’s salary, but also be within a few minutes of some of the most beautiful countryside in the world and at the heart of a concentration of culture that rivals far bigger cities. I recognise the dean’s point – with so much financial engineering demanding money and people, real engineering doesn’t stand a chance. But it is real engineering that drives industrial productivity.Financialisation is not just a problem because it drains resources away from industry. In a financialised economy, investors with short-term horizons tend to have more control over firms. This results in less reinvestment of profits and rising burdens of debt that, in a vicious cycle, makes industry even more driven by short-term considerations. In effect, this kind of finance is not neutral but changes the nature of what it finances.This was seen just recently with the GKN takeover by “turnaround company”\u0026nbspMelrose. An estimated 20 to 25 per cent of the shares in GKN were in the hands of hedge funds, many of which were expected to back the takeover – with the firm Elliott Advisors, owning 3.8 per cent\u0026nbspof the company, explicitly doing so. The bid was won by 52 per cent to 48 per cent. And Melrose itself is not run in any long-term interest other than maximising shareholder value: it has a long history of operating as a “turnaround firm” and almost a third of its own shares are held by hedge funds. The vote was essentially a referendum about the time horizons of British industry, and Britain lost.So when bankers and chancellors talk of having learned\u0026nbspthe lessons of the financial crisis they are wrong both at the macro and micro level. With UK national debt twice what it was in 2007 and household debt to disposable income at a record high, 10 years after the crash of\u0026nbspthe global economy, finance is once again at the heart of an existential threat to our way of life.Financialisation and inequality Even before the crash, this “anti-industrial strategy”\u0026nbspdrove social and geographic inequalities. Levels of income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient reached a pre-crash peak of 0.35 in the 1990s and, while improving slightly, remained high in comparison to the Sixties throughout the 2000s. Regional inequality was also a significant feature of the pre-crash economy, with data from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research showing a gradual rise throughout the 2000s in the difference in gross household income between regions. In 2005, average household income in the North East was 14 per cent below the UK average, while in London it was 20 per cent higher.Gini Coefficient 1961-2016 – 1 is the most unequal score, 0 is the most equal\u0026nbsp(Institute for Fiscal Studies)The Tories were either indifferent to these inequalities or at best felt they were an acceptable price to pay. Labour, under previous leaderships, believed that redistributive policies could make it all come out right in the end, and flagship programmes such as Sure Start and working tax credits certainly helped. But both approaches were fundamentally mistaken. Financialisation turned out to be a house built on sand – unable to generate enough wealth to compensate for the abandonment of the rest of the economy, and vulnerable to boom and bust cycles. Ultimately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the global economic crisis it spawned showed that the ideology of finance – that financial markets and institutions, left to themselves and the profit motive, would efficiently allocate capital – was a pernicious fantasy.British industry—creating real value in the real economyBut that was not the whole story. While\u0026nbspmetropolitan London came to comprise 40 per cent\u0026nbspof the British economy – and a 40 per cent\u0026nbspheavily dependent on finance and professional services – something else was happening in the rest of the country. Britain’s entry into the European Union, and the survival in parts of Britain of a culture favourable to engineering and manufacturing, fostered the growth of certain sectors of British industry as part of a larger integrated European industrial base. The supply chains of large European firms such as Airbus, Boeing and BMW are substantially British. Nissan’s Sunderland plant is the final destination for parts manufactured across Europe and produces more cars per worker than any other factory in the European Union. And GKN, itself one of the world’s oldest engineering firms, is a key supplier to international aerospace and automotive firms – including European giant Airbus, which warned against the Melrose takeover. Factories engaged in producing components and sub-assemblies and assembling components from elsewhere in Europe are now critical to the prosperity of much of Britain. Figure 1 shows just one of BMW’s many supply chains.Such integration requires frictionless borders but also agreed standards to define everything from the acceptable frequency of electromagnetic radiation to the atomic composition of a given chemical. Leaving the European Union will not mean less regulation simply more duplication. As they scramble to recreate existing EU agencies and regulations, businesses and government departments are realising that far from Brussels bureaucracy being imposed upon Britain, the European Union was effectively based on the “shared back office services”\u0026nbspmodel that Whitehall now champions for local government.In many ways, British agriculture has followed a similar trajectory to British car manufacturing, where British farmers have been able to successfully compete on both quality and price in markets defined by EU food safety rules. For example, British farmers export far more wheat flour to the EU – approximately 250,000 tonnes last year – than they do to non-EU countries – approximately 6,000 tonnes. The same goes for other agricultural products such as barley (one\u0026nbspmillion tonnes versus 50,000 tonnes) and oats (16,000 tonnes versus 4,000 tonnes).The EU is the largest importer and exporter of food in the world. As an EU member state, our farmers have benefited from preferential access to this market through exemptions from the tariffs and quotas imposed on non-member countries. And with 85 per cent of seasonal agricultural workers in the UK coming from Bulgaria and Romania, agriculture is one of the UK sectors most heavily dependent on freedom of movement.Food and drink is Britain’s largest manufacturing sector and Europe’s complex rules of origin guidelines could lead to a “hidden hard Brexit”\u0026nbsprequiring the restructuring of food manufacturing supply chains even if we secure preferential access.\u0026nbspAgriculture and manufacturing are both more important outside of London and particularly around the very market towns that have been most “left behind” by the new economy.As Britain contemplates how to engage with the world before, during and after Brexit, we need to understand the trade policy choices we make will drive the shape of our economy and are therefore also industrial policy choices, choices that will shape the very nature of what work we do, the health of our communities\u0026nbspand the way we live for decades to come.  The benefits of a customs union The Labour Party is united in supporting a customs union with Europe. We believe it will bolster our current industrial strengths and offer the possibility of continued industrial revival in certain sectors. We should not be complacent about this approach. Our place in the larger European manufacturing economy will still depend on our ability to innovate and to invest, so that British firms successfully manage and not just participate in supply chains. And this will depend on our learning the lessons of the financial crisis so that our financial markets and institutions actually invest in productive sectors.Unfortunately, the government continues to act as if the only issues in financial regulation are safety, soundness and fraud. While these are obviously important issues, they completely miss the question of whether our financial system is effectively channelling capital to productive and innovative investment. And this is the whole point of a financial system. A financial system that simply parks money in risk-free assets or honestly gambles on sporting events, would meet the characteristics the Tories have established but would still be a total failure. As Mazzucato argues, the traditional policies we have seen create a “healthy financial sector (bailed out, ring-fenced, and restructured) in a deeply sick economy”.Implications for industrial strategy of the alternativesLast week’s visit by President Trump to Britain revealed that he thinks the UK-US relationship is “the highest level of special”. Arch Brexiteers argue that he offers an alternative to a customs union with Europe: a free trade agreement with the United States, which, as a consequence of Nafta\u0026nbspwould really be a free trade agreement with all of North America. But while\u0026nbspthe US economy is of comparable size to the EU in GDP terms, $19 trillion (£14 trillion)\u0026nbspcompared to $17 trillion, they have different sectoral compositions and regulatory standards. Going in this direction would lead to substantial changes in the structure of the British economy.Earlier this year, trade experts at Harvard University published a report that included a candid assessment of obstacles to a US-UK free trade agreement. Its authors, including former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, reached the conclusion that it is “highly unlikely that a free trade deal between the US and the UK will be secured in the near term”\u0026nbspand, in addition, “the likely potential benefits for British businesses are less than often suggested”.The report focused on likely US demands for access to British food markets and likely British demands for access for British firms to US financial and professional services markets. These demands map the likely direction a US-UK free trade agreement would take both countries. Britain is attractive to the US as a market for agricultural products and for goods manufactured through US-controlled supply chains. Britain is also seen by some as a source of relatively low cost financial and professional services. Without an EU customs union, American business does not see Britain as a manufacturing platform – British wages are too high given the distance to the North American market. Labour costs per hour in manufacturing are on average £27 in the US and £23 in the UK – a £4 difference that does not compensate for transport costs.In a UK detached from the European market, the role of British industry in European supply chains will therefore not be replaced by similar roles in US-based supply chains. This is the critical point for UK manufacturing – we cannot replace European supply chain integration with North American supply chain integration.In addition, if British food safety rules are relaxed as part of a trade deal with the US, it is likely that cheap American agricultural products will significantly displace British agriculture. So we will eat chlorinated chicken from Arkansas, bake with GM flour from Dakota\u0026nbspand barbecue antibiotic drenched beef from Illinois. US farming is largely in the hands of mega industrial organisations. Agriculture is a much greater proportion of US GDP than it is of UK GDP. There are farms in Texas that are bigger than major UK counties – 500 square miles, for example. We cannot compete with agriculture on that scale without harming our landscape and bioersity, especially given that we already use substantially more of our land in percentage terms on agriculture than does the US. If our markets are opened up to US agricultural products, UK farming will either adapt to US food safety practices and scale or our agriculture will diminish greatly. If we were to follow the bidding of the arch-Brexiteers and take the US as our model partner it would be the end of our landscape and bioersity as we currently know it.In the place of agriculture and industry, there will be a US market for British financial services and other professional services such as\u0026nbsplaw, accountancy and management consulting. However, just as we have seen the integration of British manufacturing into European firms, we will likely see a wave of mergers and acquisitions in services as British firms are acquired by US firms seeking to serve the US market with British professionals. As a consequence, while\u0026nbspmanufacturing and agriculture would suffer, services and finance might not remain in British hands, especially given the current takeover regime that substantially limits the scope for government protection of UK businesses.A Britain without a customs union with the EU and with a free trade agreement with the US would have less industry, less agriculture, but more finance and more service sector jobs. It would likely be a Britain of growing regional and social disparities, and a Britain more vulnerable to financial instability. After all, it was the high concentration of financial services in the UK economy that meant we were hit particularly hard by the last financial crisis. If the UK economy consolidates further around finance, then we will become even more vulnerable.Turning from North America some look to the Commonwealth as an alternative future that harks to our past. We have strong ties to English-speaking Commonwealth countries around the world – economic ties as well as ties of language, immigration and history. In a digital world, we have the possibility of building networks of innovation that could contribute both to our own industrial competitiveness as well as the competitiveness of our partners.Countries as erse as Nigeria, Australia and India are all racing to be centres of technological innovation and to solve pressing problems in areas such as energy and education. In a sense, if we are open to our former colonies as partners, and generous with access to our own centres of innovation, we could perhaps create alternative pathways to competitiveness for our industry.But those same countries have requested access to the UK through preferential visa arrangements as part of any free trade agreement. India has requested an increase in the number of visas issued to skilled Indian workers and allow students to stay for longer after graduating, but so far government has refused calls to relax visa rules even within the current framework. Australia and other Commonwealth countries want their citizens to be granted the same rights as Europeans: to live and work in the UK after Brexit.Building a competitive commonwealth innovation network effectively requires the opposite of our current attitudes towards the Global South. Commonwealth leaders have criticised the government’s – reported – characterisation of post-Brexit trade as ‘Empire 2.0’. This was reflected in our treatment of the Windrush generation, which, in a sense, like our approach to Brexit, threatens to close critical doors to a better future for British industry and for Britain as a whole.Whether we look to North America or the Commonwealth, into our past or forward to the type of economy we want to become, the arguments bring us back to a customs union with the EU and an industrial strategy that will help rebalance the economy and provide the directed investment to get it growing again. The billions poured by the Bank of England into quantitative easing have signally failed to do this.A Labour government would invest £250bn over 10 years through our National Transformation Fund, and set up a National Investment Bank, as well as a network of regional development banks to channel investment into productive enterprises across the country, unlocking productivity and creating growth.Royal family release official photos from Prince Louis’s christeningPrince William and Prince Charles ‘refused to meet Trump’A history of tense meetings between US and Russian presidentsWe need to understand as we approach critical decision points around our trade policy and our financial regulatory policy\u0026nbspthat these are choices that will shape not just our relations with the outside world but Britain itself – that choices labelled trade policy or immigration policy or financial regulatory policy are in fact industrial policy, agricultural policy and economic policy.The Tory party ideologues are in no state to set out a vision for our future economy, far less to rationally assess the policies needed to make it a reality. Financialisation has proven to be an economic dead-end, creating wealth for the few at the expense of social equality, regional balance and long-term productivity growth.To build a more competitive and equal Britain post-Brexit we need a deal that strengthens our productive sectors such as manufacturing rather than one that deepens financialisation and risks our long-term prosperity. We also need a real industrial strategy based on our regional strengths that enables investment in the productive economy, delivering jobs in our towns as well as our cities that creates value regionally and nationally that can be shared by all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point.

It may have caused the mummies to decompose and leave only their skeletons.The bodies are probably those of warriors. One of the them appears to have a wound that is the result of being hit by an arrow, experts said.Local reports suggested that officials from the Ministry of Antiquities mocked suggestions that the sarcophagus could unleash evil forces\u0026nbspor curses when\u0026nbspopened.In fact, it appeared to contain little of any note. There were no inscriptions or objects inside the coffin that would suggest the bodies belonged to members of an ancient royal family, for instance.Some had hoped that the tomb could contain the body of Alexander The Great, which would help solve one of antiquity\u0027s greatest mysteries. But there is nothing to suggest that any of the skeletons belong to that famed warrior and empire builder.Alexander\u0027s body has never been found. He asked for his corpse to be thrown into the\u0026nbspEuphrates river – but speculation has been rife ever since that his body was actually disposed of in a tomb, and that it is still lying waiting to be found.Either way it is incredibly rare to find an unopened sarcophagus in Alexandria. Anyone planning to build in the city must first have archaeologists inspect the site, and while they occasionally find\u0026nbspsarcophagi they have usually been looted.The skeletons will now be removed from the site and sent to the National Museum of Alexandria, the ministry said.

She was joined by Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland\u0026nbspsecretary.As it happened...Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage from Westminster.Dominic Raab has just started answering MPs questions in the Commons.\u0026nbspHe is asked by Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit minister, Matt Pennycook, what advice the government is giving to financial services in relation to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspThere is laughter in the Commons as John Bercow, the Speaker, confuses Conservative MP Rachel Maclean with Labour\u0027s Rachel Maskell.\u0026nbspHe apologises, saying it was a result of his confusion rather than their lack of distinctiveness, but\u0026nbspMaclean gets her own back by jokingly referring to him as Mr Deputy Speaker.Labour\u0027s Virendra Sharma asks\u0026nbspDominic Raab to guarantee he will\u0026nbspnot use Brexit as an excuse to slash protections for minorities,\u0026nbspgiven he has previously said he does not believe in economic and social rights.\u0026nbspSuella Braverman, one of Raab\u0027s junior ministers, says the new Brexit secretary has a proven track record not only as a justice minister but also as a lawyer,\u0026nbspand any attempt to undermine his credentials and commitment to the rule of law, civil liberties and now delivering a successful Brexit is fundamentally misguided.\u0026nbspLabour frontbencher Paul Blomfeld follows a similar theme, asking why Raab\u0026nbsppreviously called Brexit an opportunity to\u0026nbspditch the most burdensome EU regulations, including those that protect agency workers by giving them the same rights as full-time staff.\u0026nbspBraverman\u0026nbspsays the government\u0027s commitment to employment protections is unequivocal.\u0026nbspShe adds:\u0026nbspRights don\u0027t emanate from the EU - we have our own rich and proud tradition of civil liberties.Dominic Raab tells MPs he hopes to intensify negotiations on the future relationship with the EU, following\u0026nbspthe publication of the government\u0027s Brexit White Paper.\u0026nbspResponding to Tory Brexiteer John Whittingdale, he also suggests the UK could withhold its Brexit bill payment unless the EU agrees\u0026nbspto a deal.\u0026nbspHe says:\u0026nbspAs the EU says, there\u0027s no deal until the whole deal is concluded...If one party does not meet its side of the bargain,\u0026nbspit would inevitably have consequences for the deal as a whole.\u0026nbspHe also says staying in the EU single market and customs union would be a\u0026nbspbreach of the referendum and also a breach of the Tory\u0027s manifesto pledge to leave both.Brexiteer Peter Bone asks about rumours the government is considering asking the EU to extend the Article 50 period.\u0026nbspRobin Walker, a Brexit minister, denies this, saying he is happy to reassure MPs that the UK will be leaving the EU next March, as outlined in the EU Withdrawal Bill and the government\u0027s White Paper.The SNP\u0027s Peter Grant asks about an HM Inspectorate of Constabulary\u0026nbspreport out today, which suggests police forces\u0026nbspshould prepare for Brexit leading to a rise in hate crime.\u0026nbspNew Brexit minister Chris Heaton-Harris\u0026nbspsays he does not believe in the slightest that Brexit will result in more hate crime.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSir Keir Starmer, Labour\u0027s shadow Brexit secretary,\u0026nbspasks Dominic Raab about comments made by leading Brexiteer Steve Baker, who said 40 Tory MPs would be willing to vote down the government\u0027s\u0026nbspplan.\u0026nbspStarmer asks how the government will get its plan through Parliament.\u0026nbspRaab says Starmer seems more interested in doing the job of whipping this side than coming up with any serious, substantive proposals from his side.\u0026nbspStarmer gives it another crack, asking Raab whether he personally is prepared to face down that threat.\u0026nbspThe Brexit secretary says he is not interested in the media circus or any of the drama because he is relentlessly and unflinchingly focused on narrowing the differences, accentuating the positives and getting a win-win deal good for this country and good for our European friends.Julian\u0026nbspSmith, the government\u0027s chief whip, is facing calls to resign after Tory chairman\u0026nbspBrandon Lewis breached a long-standing convention by voting in Tuesday\u0027s crunch Brexit votes, despite having been paired with the Lib Dem\u0027s Jo Swinson, who has just had a baby.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSmith,\u0026nbspLewis and Theresa May have\u0026nbspinsisted it was a genuine mistake, but The Times reported this morning that Smith had also told two other MPs to ignore pairing arrangements (they refused).\u0026nbspLabour said if that is true then the chief whip should resign. Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister, said:\u0026nbspIf these reports are correct, the Tory whips, Brandon Lewis and even the prime minister have been telling untruths about their shocking move against an MP on maternity leave.\u0026nbspBreaking a pairing arrangement was a desperate move by a collapsing government and makes politics even more inaccessible for women.\u0026nbspWe need a full, honest explanation of what\u0027s gone on. If they can\u0027t do so, surely the chief whip and Conservative Party chair should resign.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTheresa May has backed under pressure chief whip Julian Smith.\u0026nbspAsked if the prime minister stood by claims that the events that saw Brandon Lewis breach a pairing arrangement were an honest mistake, a No 10 spokesperson simply said: Absolutely.The Conservatives have just issued a statement on the Julian\u0026nbspSmith row.\u0026nbspA spokesperson said: We have apologised for the fact that a pregnancy pairing arrangement was broken in error this week. No other pairs offered on the Trade Bill on Tuesday were broken.\u0026nbspInterestingly, the statement includes no denial of claims that other MPs were asked to break their pairs. Reports suggest at least two refused to do so.\u0026nbspPressure is definitely mounting on the chief whip...Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chief whip, has told MPs he remains unconvinced by Julian Smith\u0027s explanation for why pairing agreements were broken during Tuesday\u0027s Brexit votes.\u0026nbspCarmichael asked an urgent question in the Commons on the matter yesterday and later met with his Tory counterpart.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe has just told the Commons:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the course of that urgent question, I indicated that I had received an apology from the government chief whip, which of course I accepted -\u0026nbspnot that I did not quite understand how things had come to pass in this way. I indicated also that I would pursue that with the government chief whip.I have to tell the House that, subsequent to the urgent question, I did meet with the government chief whip. He did offer me a fuller explanation, which I have considered very carefully overnight. Regrettably I have to say I still do not understand how this highly regrettable state of affairs came to pass.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If we take a bit more of that approach, a bit more unity of purpose, we’ll get a great result out of Brexit.We’ll also unite the country.In the same interview, Raab also spoke of his concerns for the transition period:One thing I get nervous about, or anxious, is that we don’t cower in a corner, so fixated on the risk that we look somehow afraid of our own shadow.Britain is a hell of a lot better than that.The health of the post-referendum economy has been branded as everything from \u0027extraordinarily resilient\u0027 to one government report\u0027s conclusion that \u0027the UK will be worse off in every scenario\u0027. Unsurprisingly, Raab\u0027s assessment appears to lean towards the former. He told the publication: We should go into these negotiations with a bit of economic self-confidence.The economy has held up and proved far more resilient than some of the naysayers suggested.We should go into it with political ambition.He also told the magazine that lawmakers should be ready to compromise during the transition period, as long as manifesto promises are delivered. I think if we’re true to our promises that we’ve made in our manifesto – and the mandate that we got from the referendum, which was to take back control over our borders, our laws and our money – I think we ought to on the Brexit side be flexible about the bridge to that end state.More: This man\u0027s explanation of why young people should stop Brexit is flooring people for next articleindy100 and its partners use cookies and similar technology to collect and analyse information about the users of this website.

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

In the eventuality, only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 percent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. We can’t remain in the 30s.\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It now presents\u0026nbspthe bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspCritics have also railed against the way the plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia, and Saudi Arabia. The Finance Minister Anton Siliuanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin advisor Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions, the new proposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country\u0027s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families, the change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been several modest\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Yekaterina Shulman\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Shulman’s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary Dmitry Peskov has distanced the president from the unpopular bill like Macavity, he’s always been a mile away.\u0026nbspReports, on the other, hand suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform,” to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote, the Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down the reaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

That feeling gets stronger the further away from Moscow you get.”\u0026nbspIn parliament today, Mr Topilin\u0026nbspoffered several sweeteners to the bill. He\u0026nbspemphasised that the changes will be offset by increases in the basic\u0026nbsppension by 12,000 rubles a year (£150).\u0026nbspThat may not be enough to quell the “unrest” in the political system and across the elite, says the former Kremlin official and consultant Konstantin Kostin.

Jurassic World expert says dinosaur cloning could be reality                Jurassic World dinosaur: T-Rex ancestor found in ancient fossilThe four-legged dino would also have had small leaf-shaped teeth for eating plants.The armoured dinosaurs, known as ankylosaurids, resembled an Asian species with protective spiky armour covering the skull and snout.Their American counterparts had a smooth boned armour instead.New research published in PeerJ says that although ankylosaurids originated in Asia between 125 to 100 million years ago, they have only been in western North America around 77 million years ago.Scientists suggests the dinosaurs may have walked over a land bridge, immigrating to North America thanks to lowered sea levels.SWNSLife reconstruction of the new armored dinosaur Akainacephalus johnsoniThe genus name comes from the Greek words \u0026lsquoakaina\u0026rsquo, which means \u0026lsquothorn\u0026rsquo or \u0026lsquospike\u0026rsquo, and \u0026lsquocephalus\u0026rsquo, meaning head.The dinosaur was named \u0026lsquojohnsoni\u0026rsquo after the Natural History Museum volunteer who prepared its skull for exhibition in Utah.After the discovery, it took four years to prepare the skeleton for the exhibition.Retired chemist and palaeontology volunteer Randy Johnson was thrilled about the dedication.He said: I couldn\u0027t believe it when they told me they are naming the ankylosaur after me, a once in a lifetime honour.Palaeontologists are researching why nearly every species of dinosaur discovered over the past 15 years in the National Monument is new to science.The area would have been on the southern part of the \u0026lsquolost continent\u0026rsquo of Laramidia, an island stretching from Alaska to Mexico before the two parts of North America merged to make one continent.SWNSThe dinosaur was dug up from the desert at the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in UtahLarge and small meat-eating dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs and duck-billed dinosaurs are also among other recently discovered species in the area.The skeleton of a duck-bill dinosaur known as Gryposaurus, a recently-discovered species of turtle and a species related to alligators that is yet to be named were also found at the site of the new dinosaur.Lead author and PhD student Jelle Wiersma said: It is always exciting to name a new fossil taxon, but it is equally exciting if that taxon also provides additional insights into the bigger picture of its life, such as its diet or aspects of its behaviour, and the environment it lived in.Such is exactly the case with Akainacephalus johnsoni not only is this the first described and named Late Cretaceous ankylosaurid dinosaur from Utah, but this unique animal also strengthens the evidence that distinct northern and southern provincialism existed during the late Campanian stage in Laramidia.A major long-term goal of our work in southern Utah is to try and understand why the species in GSENM differ from relatives of the same geologic age found in other parts of Laramidia.Dr Randall Irmis, co-author of the study, said: A reasonable hypothesis would be that ankylosaurids from Utah are related to those found elsewhere in western North America, so we were really surprised to discover that Akainacephalus was so closely related to species from Asia."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/590x/Belgian-airspace-closed-991369.jpg","title":"belgian airspace closed brussels airport belgium air traffic flight delays latest","story":"Belgian airspace has been closed, with several flights suspended (Image: flightradar24)The problem will cause passengers severe disruption.\u0026nbspBelgocontrol said it was working to find a solution to the problem.\u0026nbspBrussels airport said on Twitter, referring to the Belgium air traffic control authority: Due to an exceptional situation air traffic is temporarily suspended.Belgocontrol is looking in to it.

In pubs, in shop windows, on cars, on scaffolding, on hats and shirts and flying above 10 Downing Street.And nobody was sneering at our flag now. Just guessing, but I doubt if anyone will be sneering at that flag any time soon.Not even Labour’s Emily Thornberry.What a ride. What a month-long high. What an adventure for those of us who are old enough to remember 1966 and also for the children who will remember this as the first World Cup they watched.Fifty years from today, those kids will still remember how they felt when England won a penalty shootout against Colombia, and when Kieran Trippier bent it better than Beckham after five minutes against Croatia.And they will remember to their dying day exactly what it felt like when we knew that England was not going to the final.The tears are real but so is the pride. And the pride — even more than the disappointment — is the overwhelming emotion today.England played with big hearts, true grit and the fearlessness of youth.They come home not as legends to rival the boys of 1966 but with their heads held high. Their nation is proud of them.And yes, it is only a game. It is not a war. Nobody died.But at a time when our nation is more horribly divided than at any time in modern history, we were reminded what a great country this still is, and how much we have to be proud of, and how much there is to love.And it was not your imagination — England was united once again.“Our country has been through difficult times in terms of unity,” said England’s young manager in his thoughtful, softly spoken manner.“Sport — football in particular — has the power to help that.“We’re a team that, with our diversity and our youth, represents modern England.In England, we have spent a bit of time being a bit lost as to what our modern identity is. I think we represent that modern identity and hopefully people can connect with us.”Gareth Southgate is right about the healing power of sport. This World Cup brought us together in a way we’ve not experienced since the London 2012 Olympics.But 2012 was before the bitter wounds of Brexit.It is Gareth Southgate himself who is the main reason this country has rallied around this England team.Southgate with his courtesy, his decency and his Yoda-like intelligence.Southgate,  who talks about “owning the process” and “managing our energy” — it is quite difficult to imagine the former England manager, Big Sam Allardyce, being comfortable with that kind of 21st Century dialogue. Southgate with his dapper shirt, tie and waistcoat combo, as suave as a suburban James Bond.Southgate who carries himself as if he is the living embodiment of Rudyard Kipling’s most famous poem.“If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those imposters just the same . . . you will be a man, my son!”Even as England were celebrating their very first win in a World Cup penalty shootout, Southgate took time to comfort Mateus Uribe, one of the two Colombian players who had missed their penalty.This was more than an act of sportsmanship. It was an act of humanity.Because we all knew that Southgate has been there.The abiding memory of Gareth Southgate as a player — the one moment that everyone remembers — is in Euro 1996, with his shoulders sagging inside a grey England shirt and his spirit smashed after missing a penalty (we never recall the players who were too cowardly to step up and take a penalty — history gives them a pass).Stuart “Psycho” Pearce had known penalty redemption — missing in Italia 1990 but scoring in Euro 1996. Southgate’s redemption has been infinitely more convoluted.There was an image that went viral of the 25-year-old Gareth Southgate after just missing a penalty in 1996 being comforted by the 47-year-old Gareth Southgate who shook up the world in Russia in 2018.If this World Cup has gone some way to healing our divided nation, it has also gone a long way to healing the pain that Southgate has endured for half a lifetime.It is true what they say ­— success is not final, failure is not fatal.The manager was well served by this young team, who were light years away from the central casting image of the Premier League footballer — the pampered, wag-shagging, blingtastic, Bentley-crashing, multi-millionaire airhead.These England footballers — even the star striker, Harry Kane, who would cost a minimum £100million if Real Madrid came knocking — were clearly of and from the working class.They hail, every one of them, from modest beginnings. Most of the squad — 15 — paid their Premier League dues while out on loan in the lump-kicking lower leagues.“Barnsley, Leeds, Bolton, Blackburn,” said Southgate. “We’re lads who have come from those places.”This England team are not ordinary boys — they are elite professional athletes — but they have all been ordinary boys, and there was a humility about them, a work ethic and total lack of pretension that made you believe they will never forget their roots.And if they come from everywhere from the North East to Yorkshire to the Essex/East End borders, they also come from every kind of family.There were those who grew up in solid nuclear families with both mum and dad and siblings present, and those who were raised by single mums, and those who are from domestic chaos.Raheem Sterling’s father was murdered in Jamaica when he was two, and Dele Alli escaped the turmoil of his riven family life by moving in with his best friend’s family when he was 13.Their backstories are as diverse as our nation, but every one of them has grafted to get to the top.Sterling was berated for having an assault rifle tattooed on his leg but nobody ran harder or longer for the England cause than Raheem.When you watched his mesmeric, lung-busting runs, how could you not warm to him?How could you not forgive one dumb tatt?“Good lads,” said Southgate of his England squad, those boys from the Mersey and the Thames and the Tyne, from Bury and Leeds and Sheffield, and once again he said it all.They are good lads and we cheered them, and celebrated with them, and in the end, we shared their pain because it was our pain too, even in defeat against Belgium yesterday.They were a band of brothers and for one magical sun-drenched summer month, they lit up our nation.This World Cup was a roller-coaster ride that grabbed you by the scruff of your replica Three Lions shirt from the first match against Tunisia and refused to let go until the end of extra time against Croatia.They came SO CLOSE — Croatia led England for 11 minutes.That’s how agonisingly near we were to saying, “Bonjour, Monsieur,” in today’s World Cup final.It was gloriously entertaining, but it was also far more than just entertainment.It felt like Gareth Southgate and that young England team represented the very best of us.We learned — or we were reminded — that decency is not weakness, sportsmanship is not soft, and you need never feel one twinge of shame if you give your all.And we learned that we love our national game with a passion that can never be denied.I honestly thought we would win it.Typical England fan!I believed that this was the year we added the second World Cup winner’s gold star to the team shirt.When the England players were chucking around rubber chickens at a training session just before the Croatia semi-final, I thought it was a tension-busting masterstroke.It wasn’t to be.But this England team have been through the full range of human emotions — from joy to despair, hope to disappointment, and this country has been with them every step of the way.The struggle continues, the dream will never die.I reckon 50,000 England football fans will already be making plans to go to Qatar in 2022.This World Cup will be remembered for breaking our hearts and uniting our nation.And a grateful, emotionally exhausted country has just two words for those Three Lions.Thank you. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One able to set its own laws and control its borders.The idea of taking diktats from European courts, having no border control, and being unable to strike free trade deals — while paying Brussels £39billion — is not the Brexit people voted for.Mrs May should look at our poll today to see the bloody nose the Tories could be dealt at the next General Election.Unless she starts being honest with the country, then she will cause further disillusionment among voters, potentially opening the door to Jeremy Corbyn…Ushering in Britain’s first Marxist PM should not be a legacy Mrs May wants. EXPECTATIONS were not high before the World Cup began — for once.With the pressure lifted off the players’ shoulders — combined with Gareth Southgate’s leadership — our boys played with passion and determination.Despite yesterday’s loss to Belgium, they were real ambassadors for England.Meanwhile, the FA are set to apply for the 2030 World Cup.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

Except they haven’t. Theresa May’s proposal to the EU isn’t the grim “reality” of Brexit. It is merely what happens when negotiated ineptly, by Remainers.They further argue we should choose between no-deal, Mrs May’s proposal or staying in. Why? The first vote determined we were leaving. The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them. It just marks them “disturbing” and limits them to users claiming to be over 18.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They will also ensure children learn how to recognise when others are struggling with mental health and how to respond.The classes will help bolster “healthy friendships, family relationships and other relationships they are likely to encounter”.Mr Hinds said: “I want to make sure that our children are able to grow up to become happy and well-rounded individuals who know how to deal with the challenges of the modern world.“Part of this is making sure they are informed about how to keep themselves safe and healthy and have good relationships with others.He added: “Good physical and mental health is also at the heart of ensuring young people are ready for the adult world.By making health education compulsory we are giving young people the tools they need to be ready to thrive when they leave school.”Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the Institute for Economic Affairs, said: “No one disagrees with ‘health education in principle, but the curriculum is becoming so packed with worthy causes that children will soon not have time to read and write.“Children are already bombarded by endless healthy eating messages at school.

Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there. This is because tourists enjoy looking at the scenic islands. Without having their view obliterated by a pair of breasts the size of Koh Samui.So watch yourself, Katie. And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees. He, like almost all of their staff, was kept on a contract which allowed the firm to pay him less than the proper rate.They were done under a UK Supreme Court decision, using laws designed to stop unscrupulous firms exploiting cheap labour.I wonder what it is about the EU that Pimlico Plumbers likes so much?

Fertility rates fell for every age group apart from the over 40s, where there were more births than at any point since 1949.The shock figures came a day after experts warned Britain faced 50 years of austerity because health spending will have to double to cope with the dramatic rise in old-age pensioners.Tory peer Ros Altmann told The Sun: “This is just a glimpse of the demographic disaster that awaits us.The Government needs to get a grip of this and develop policies that address pension costs, health costs and social care.”The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) on Tuesday said the number of over 65s as a proportion of the working age population would rise from just below 30 per cent to nearly 50 per cent by the 2060s.Age related spending is expected to take up nearly a third of the Government’s entire budget at this time.Yesterday’s birth figures revealed foreign-born Mums accounted for 28.4 per cent of all births in 2017 – a new record and up from 28.2 per cent in 2016 and just 11.6 per cent in 1990.The stillbirth rate fell to the lowest rate since current records began in 1927.ONS spokeswoman Nicola Haines said: Birth rates for live births have decreased for all women except those aged 40 years and over where the birth rate has continued to rise, following a trend seen for the last 40 years.Despite this, the proportion of women aged 40 and over having a baby still remains below that seen in the 1940s.She added: The stillbirth rate has dropped to a record low, declining each year since 2011.It is a step towards achieving a government ambition to reduce the rate of stillbirths by introducing new maternity strategies while ensuring the best and safest care.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sixty-two MPs voted for the bill, with 55 against.However some clauses were dropped including one that would have enshrined in law the creation of Jewish-only communities.Heres what it all means...The Jewish Nation-State Bill, passed just after the state marked the 70th anniversary of its birth, was hailed as a defining moment in the annals of Zionism by Netanyahu.The bill enshrines Hebrew as the only official language of the state, stripping Arabic of that status, and names Jewish settlement a top priority.Netanyahu said the bill was about defending the Jewish character of the state, which was established in 1948 as a homeland for the Jewish people, for generations to come.We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israels democracy but the majority also has rights and the majority decides, he said.The law becomes one of the so-called Basic Laws, which, like a constitution, guide Israel’s legal system and are usually more difficult to repeal than regular laws.The bill, backed by the countrys right-wing government, says Israel is the historic homeland of the Jewish people and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it.The bills critics, including many Arabs, claim it is racist and discriminatory and will plant the seeds of an apartheid state.Israeli Arabs currently make up about 20 per cent of Israels population of around nine million people.They have equal rights under law but say they are being treated as second-class citizens and say they face discrimination and worse provision of services such as education, health and housing.Arab MP Ahmed Tibi said the bills passing represented the death of democracyin Israel.Adalah, a legal centre for Arabs living in Israel, called the law illegitimate and colonial.It said it seeks to maintain a regime in which one ethnic-national group controls an indigenous-national group living in the same territory while advancing ethnic superiority by promoting racist policies.Self determination is the right of a country and its people to be independent, instead of being controlled by a foreign power, and to choose its own form of government.In particular, the principle allows citizens to choose their own political status and to determine their own form of economic, cultural and social development.The impact of the right to self-determination was seen in the 2002 referendum where Gibraltarians hugely rejected a plan to share sovereignty between the UK and Spain.The concept was first embodied in the American Declaration Of Independence (1776) and then in the Frances Declaration Of The Rights Of Man (1789).The ratification of the United Nations Charter in 1945 at the end of war placed the right of self-determination into the framework of international law. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

investigation found eight out of 11 slime toys tested contained potentially dangerous levels of borax.The chemical is linked to diarrhoea, stomach cramps, and is feared to cause health problems in unborn babies as well as infertility problems.Laylas GP prescribed an antibacterial cream and told Gemma to seek further help if the blisters didnt clear up in a couple of days.The following Thursday, she took Layla to Leicester Royals A\u0026ampE department, where doctors revealed the burns had developed into the skin infection, impetigo.She had open sores on her hands and the skin was just peeling off her fingers, it was awful, Gemma said.A small patch had spread to her face and arm, it was then we were told she had impetigo.The A\u0026ampE doctor was surprised when he heard it was caused by playing with slime.Layla is still taking antibiotics, but the blisters and infection has almost cleared up completely, two weeks later.Gemma said as a parent she felt guilty, and questioned whether she should have been monitoring her daughter more closely.One things for certain, she wont be touching that stuff again, the 39-year-old added.Layla said despite loving playing with slime with her friends, she be doing so in future.I started playing with slime as all my friends were and I just wanted to join in, the primary school pupil said.I thought it was really cool.The last time I played with it I just googled the recipe, the slime felt a bit fluffier than usual, but it was fine.“When I woke up the next morning they were still itchy and when I looked down my fingers were blistered, it was then I thought ‘I need to tell my mum’.“It all got worse and started spreading to my fingers on both hands.

Some subway trains were bypassing the area.I looked around and saw this big huge plume of steam shoot into the air, said Daniel Lizio-Katzen, 42, who was riding his bike home to the West Village.It was a pretty violent explosion, Lizio-Katzen told the Daily News.The steam was shooting up into the air about 70 feet. It was pushing up at such a high pressure that it was spewing all of this dirt and debris.The cars around were coated in mud ... It left a huge crater in the middle of the street.Brendan Walsh, 22, a senior at New York University, had just gotten off a train and was headed to class when he saw the plume.The billows were about six stories high. There was a large scatter of debris, he said. I was standing behind the police line when a Con Cd worker came rushing over and screaming at police and firefighters to push everyone north because he was worried that there could be secondary manhole explosions.Everyone including the police and firefighters who were standing by started moving back, he said.Buildings along several blocks of Fifth Avenue have been evacuated as a precaution.An FDNY spokesman described it as a high pressure steam leak but said investigators are yet to conclusively say what caused it.In a spooky turn of events the blast comes almost exactly 11 years after another steam pipe burst in the city.That explosion killed one person and injured 45 after a pipe ruptured on the corner of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue on July 18 2007."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421552272.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"960\" width=\"960","title":"emelia holden waitress grabbed vinnie van go go savannah georgia","story":"CCTV footage shows Emelia Holden, 21, sorting through a pile of menus at Vinnie Van Go-Gos in Savannah, Georgia, when the perv gropes her on his way out.But brave Emelia immediately turned to grab him by the scruff of his neck - before throwing him against a wall with one arm.She then berates him in front of other customers before telling co-workers to call the police.The customer was hauled off in cuffs after cops reviewed CCTV footage.Emelia said: I just did what I felt was best.

Today the list of investigations was removed from the commissioners website.Labours Kevin Barron, chairman of the Parliament standards committee, tabled an amendment removing the anonymity clause from the new guidelines, which have been spearheaded by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom.He said during todays debate: It will be presented as MPs trying to cover up their misdoings.Its also good news for anybody who wants to smear a Member of Parliament - they can simply tell the media that the member has broken a rule and is under investigation.Since the Parliamentary Commissioner will be effectively gagged she will not be able to confirm or deny this. The rumour will continue and no-one will have the authority to put the record straight.Jess Phillips added: I do worry about how it looks in trying to pull back on transparency.But the amendment was defeated by 79 votes to 22.Those voting against the motion included at least two MPs who have been accused of sexual harassment before having their names cleared.The Sun revealed last week that the secrecy clause had been inserted in a bid to please senior Tory backbenchers.The new rules are intended to stop a repeat of the Pestminster scandal which rocked Parliament last year and saw the resignation of senior ministers Michael Fallon and Damian Green."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421494577.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"tesco delivery driver autistic toddler viral","story":"Lauren Browne, 24, had her weekly shop delivered on Monday and her three-year-old son Tommy answered the door.The youngster didn’t respond to the supermarket worker who asked Tommy: “Are you not up for talking today wee man?”Lauren, from Andover, Hants, then explained that he has autism and expected to receive one of the usual responses, which includes a nod of the head or “bless him”.However, she was surprised when the “wonderful gentleman” treated him no differently and began giving him light items from the shopping to put away.Once all of the products had been stored and Lauren had signed for the order, the man then asked Tommy to sign for the delivery as well and helped him click the “finished” button.Lauren, a mum-of-two, said: “I could instantly see that he was a nice person.

The misunderstanding and misinformation surrounding the GRA and self-identification makes everyday life even harder for a group of people already subject to prejudice and abuse.They point out that the Equalities Act is the law that allows trans people to use the facilities appropriate to their preferred gender.So for many years trans people have been using changing rooms, toilets and women\u0027s services such as rape centres - and there is no evidence to suggest that there has been any problem with this at all.The British Social Attitudes Survey, an annual study of public beliefs carried out by NatCen, gave this year\u0027s findings on attitudes to transgender people exclusively to Sky News.In general, the public seem to be liberal with 84% claiming not to be prejudiced at all against trans people."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-ireland-border_4365627.jpg?20180719082223 ","title":"can the pm remould her brexit deal on the potters wheel in fermanagh","story":"No one wants a hard border, but six months from Brexit, there is no plan in place to prevent one.In his resignation statement, the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson told the House of Commons the Irish border had become \"politically charged\".He added that the problem of the land boundary \"had hitherto been assumed on all sides to be readily soluble\".When they needed agreement last December, the UK and EU found a solution - a safety net they call \"the backstop\".:: Northern Ireland \u0027unsupportive\u0027 of \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit The EU understood it meant that, in the event of no deal, Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union.The issue is further complicated by the fact that most people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EU.But the DUP campaigned to leave, their MPs vote with the Brexiteers, and the prime minister needs them right now.It is not by coincidence that Mrs May\u0027s visit will take in Fermanagh - Arlene Foster\u0027s own Stormont constituency.If \"no deal\" produces a hard border, it will not be better than a \"bad deal\" for people living here."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/04/2048x1152/skynews-comcast-nbc_4292245.jpg?20180425122023 ","title":"comcast drops fox bid to focus on sky takeover","story":"Shares of 21st Century Fox have fallen by 1.5% in pre-market trading.Comcast\u0027s decision to walk away from the battle for Fox\u0027s assets could mean an intensification of the battle to take control of Sky.Fox, which is currently Sky\u0027s biggest shareholder with a 39.1% stake, sought to take full control of the company in December 2016 with an offer valuing the company at \u0026#16318.5bn.That bid was snared up in regulatory investigations - leaving Comcast free to swoop in February with a \u0026#16322.1bn offer of its own."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-michel-barnier-dominic-raab_4366124.jpg?20180719163750 ","title":"eu member states told to step up no deal brexit preparations","story":"Speaking alongside Mr Raab, Mr Barnier described the agreement of \"an all-weather insurance policy\" for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, whatever the outcome of Brexit talks, as a \"matter of urgency\".He also repeated Brussels\u0027 position that a future EU-UK trade agreement must respect the \"fundamental principles that define the EU\".Mr Raab and Mr Barnier met in Brussels after EU member states were told to step up their preparations for a possible \"no deal\" Brexit.The European Commission said \"everyone must now step up plans for all scenarios and take responsibility for their specific situation\", including businesses and citizens, ahead of Britain\u0027s official exit day of 29 March 2019.It warns of the possibility of long queues at borders and ports, disruption to air travel and new restrictions on data transfers if no exit deal is agreed between London and Brussels - something that is also sometimes referred to as a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.\"Today\u0027s text calls on member states and private parties to step up preparations and follows a request by the European Council last month to intensify preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes,\" the bloc\u0027s executive said.\"While the EU is working day and night for a deal ensuring an orderly withdrawal, the UK\u0027s withdrawal will undoubtedly cause disruption - for example in business supply chains - whether or not there is a deal.\"It added \"there is still no certainty that there will be a ratified withdrawal agreement in place on that date [30 March 2019]\".

Sarah Russell stayed on the phone for almost an hour to Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who called 999 complaining she could not escape due to the smoke. The girl told her she lived on the 20th floor but had taken refuge along with others higher up the tower block. Ms Russell said she answered the call, her first, at around 1.15am, and tried to get basic information from the little girl. In a written statement to the public inquiry, the London Fire Brigade control room officer said: I asked the girl what her name was and she told me it was Jessica.   \u0027Whole community\u0027 raped girl, 12, for SEVEN MONTHS in latest horror attack in India  I asked Jessica if she was calling from her phone and I think she said she was. I asked to speak to someone a bit older to try and get some more information from them, but she did not hand it over I do not know why. Perhaps she did not want to. I felt I needed stay with her and that she needed me. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and she said \u0027yes\u0027. I am glad I did - even if it was only to offer her a little support. The fact that she did not hand the phone to anyone else showed to me that she needed it. Ms Russell advised the very scared 12-year-old to go to the room least affected by smoke, shut the windows, stay low and cover her mouth. She went on: After about an hour I could not get anymore response from her - only rasping sounds, then nothing. I stayed on the line a little while longer with my hand hovered over the call termination button. I was torn as what best to do. I eventually ended the call when the line fell silent. Reflecting on that call, I felt completely helpless.

The information that Jessica had fled to a higher floor was not passed on to fire crews on the ground, who searched her flat but found no trace of the youngster. She was one of 72 people who died following the blaze on June 14 last year. Ms Russell revealed that, not long after the call ended, she became aware that the advice to callers had been changed from stay-put to attempt to evacuate. She said she did not recall ringing previous callers back with the changed advice, just answering the relentless calls and updating new callers. There was a lull in the calls at around 5am, Ms Russell said, recalling the words of a fellow operator. She said: It went eerily quiet and a little creepy.

The list of MPs currently under investigation has already vanished from Parliament\u0027s website just minutes after today\u0027s decision in the House of Commons. It comes after MPs agreed the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner will no longer name MPs it is investigating - until that investigation finishes. Even then, in some cases the MP may not be named, even if they are found to be at fault. The watchdog probes MPs who are accused of using information for financial gain, having a conflict of interest or damaging the reputation and integrity of the House of Commons more generally.  Until this afternoon there was a current inquiries page on Parliament\u0027s website, which listed the names of MPs who were subject to ongoing probes. But that page has now vanished after MPs agreed the watchdog should no longer routinely publish information about individual investigations before those investigations are concluded. Backers said the move would ensure consistency and fairness because Parliament\u0027s new complaints scheme promises anonymity for both sides.   Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said: We need a clear run at this, so we need confidentiality and we need consistency. But Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said: I think the optics of this house rolling back transparency is deeply deeply worrying. The proposals were backed by all parties. A direct bid to block the shake-up and keep names public was backed by just 22 MPs - while 79 voted not to block it.  Not a single Tory voted to block the shake-up. Twenty Labour MPs, independent John Woodcock and Green MP Caroline Lucas voted to block it. Seventy of the 79 MPs who voted for anonymity were Tories. Five were from Labour, including shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler. Three were Lib Dems and one was from the DUP . Under the new system, all current investigations by the Commissioner will be secret. If only the Commissioner was involved in an investigation, and not the new system, the MP involved will be named at the end of a probe - no matter what. If both the Commissioner and the new complaints scheme were involved, however, it is more complicated. MPs will not be named if the complaint was not upheld and if they weren\u0027t named in the press. Even if the complaint was upheld, the Commissioner will have regard for proportion and the MP\u0027s reputation, as well as any desire for anonymity by the complainant, before deciding whether to publish.

The Work and Pensions Secretary admitted she is working on changes that are still needed to the six-in-one welfare system - five years and a million claimants after it launched. They include more support for the self-employed and possible changes to the taper rate to let people keep more of the money they earn. But she refused to say the system had been flawed - or if she backs ex-welfare chief Iain Duncan Smith\u0027s call to pump in \u0026pound2billion a year more. Mr Duncan Smith made his call after money was sucked out of the system before it launched in a move that will leave hundreds of thousands of families worse off. Asked by the Mirror if her climbdowns showed the system as rolled out was too harsh or brutal, she said: It was very very slow as we rolled it out so we were monitoring as we were rolled it out. So no, it wasn\u0027t, and we\u0027ve stopped and changed it as we went along.  What is right is we continue to learn and change. Some \u0026pound1.5billion was put into Universal Credit to make it fairer at last year\u0027s Budget, and further cash will be approved for people with severe disabilities. But in May Iain Duncan Smith, who held the job for six years before quitting over one benefit cut too far, called for \u0026pound2billion more a year for UC on top of that. Ms McVey avoided saying whether she backed Mr Duncan Smith. Instead she pointed out the cash that had already been put in. In a speech to charities and campaigners at the Reform think tank, Ms McVey pleaded for their ideas to improve the benefit - despite it being in its sixth year. UC\u0027s rollout was blasted by the National Audit Office, pitching her into a public row with the watchdog when she was accused of misrepresenting its findings.  But Ms McVey said: We need to reach out to, learn from organisations such as yourselves, and yes, that includes the National Audit Office, about how to design and implement Universal Credit to support claimants. We want to work with you to understand where we can improve on this important reform. And there are changes that are still needed which I\u0027m working on. Debt repayments, support for the self-employed, payment cycles for those in work, and an extension of outreach work and an extension of flexible support for claimants. Campaigners have warned self-employed workers face being crushed by UC because they are barred from claiming any more benefits than if they earned minimum wage. Ms McVey also signalled she could cut the \u0027taper rate\u0027, the amount of benefit taken away for every pound earned, further after it reduced from 65p to 63p. She said: If we can, yes we would look to reduce that.

In jaw-dropping scenes, David Gliddon, 72, said the big feline creature leapt onto a wall in front of him while he was driving between Trentishoe and Heddon\u0027s Mouth on Exmoor. While he failed to take a photo, the sighting comes amid reports of others claiming they have seen evidence of the so called \u0027Exmoor Beast\u0027.  David, from Williton in Somerset, described the cat as a great big thing with a thick, two foot long tail - and told DevonLive that the experience had left him dumbstruck.  He had been walking near Hunter\u0027s Inn on July 4 with his daughter prior to the sighting. It was the size of a large Labrador, or possibly bigger, he said.  It jumped up onto a wall about five yards in front of me on the road, the way it moved was just like a cat. Its tail was about two foot long and very thick, a constant width from start to finish. It was a browny greyish colour with slightly lighter, almost green flecks or spots. It was only there for an instant before it jumped over the other side of the wall. Stunned, David stopped the car in the middle of the road and ran to the wall to see if the animal was still there. He said: When I looked over the wall it looked like it had run off into the thick bracken.  I have never seen anything like this before. It was so clear. I was dumbstruck, I could not believe what I had seen. David, a keen wildlife watcher, says he is aware of wild mink and terrapins in this area, and the pythons and wallaby have also been spotted previously in West Somerset. He said: I\u0027ve always kept an open mind. I\u0027ve been on safari in Africa and seen a leopard from a distance, and this animal very similar in its characteristics. It was a jaw-dropping experience. I\u0027d like to know if any farmers in that area have lost any sheep recently or if anyone else has spotted anything similar.

The family had been due to fly back with Thomas Cook to Manchester at 8.20pm on Thursday, July 5 but arrived at the airport only to be told they faced a two-and-a-half hour delay because of technical issues.   Bekki, who was also joined on the flight by mum Deb Dale and step-dad Michael Dale, said: “We got to the check-in and were told it would be a two-and-a-half hour delay but then at the gate it said three. We eventually boarded the plane but when we got on it was stifling - Shane said he felt sick. “After two hours my eldest daughter was having nose bleeds and my youngest looked as though she had just got out the bath because she was dripping with sweat. Passengers were using their safety cards to fan her down. It was really scary. She was so floppy and struggling to keep awake. “They opened the doors but there was a lot of commotion and after about three hours a young girl fainted. “I was worried for all our health - it was unbearable. Any longer and we would have all passed out.” Bekki, who also has a nine-year-old daughter, added: “Eventually the plane was taken back to the runway at 12.15am but we were told that under Lanzarote laws planes can’t take off after midnight.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how brave eight year old","story":"NewsHow brave eight-year-old girl \u0027project managed\u0027 her own death - then \u0027led parents to perfect Center Parcs-like grave\u0027EXCLUSIVE: Little Kaleigh Lau\u0027s family regularly have picnics at her resting place after she died from a rare brain cancer last month - they say: \"There\u0027s no sadness around there, it feels like Center Parcs\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans15:32, 19 JUL 2018Updated15:44, 19 JUL 2018NewsLittle Kaleigh Lau died peacefully surrounded by her parents and six-year-old brother last month (Image: Mirrorpix)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave eight-year-old girl \u0027project managed\u0027 her own death so her loved ones could visit and say a final goodbye, her grieving family say.  Little Kaleigh Lau died peacefully surrounded by her parents and six-year-old brother last month after battling a rare brain cancer .  Her dad, Scott, believes she prepared everybody for her passing by falling into a deep \u0027sleep\u0027 before she took her final breaths. During this time, he says all of her loved ones were able to visit her - and it was only once they had, that she decided time is up. But even on the day she died, Kaleigh\u0027s condition changed dramatically as her gran, aunt and uncle raced down the country to see her.  Despite being up and down in the early hours of that morning, she became stable as her relatives began the heartbreaking journey.  She remained this way until they arrived at hospital several hours later.  Once they had, she quickly deteriorated and passed away. Kaleigh was the ultimate project manager, Scott, 42, told . She was preparing everybody for her death. She was in a sleep and everybody went to visit her who wanted to visit her. That\u0027s when she started to say, \u0027Time is up\u0027. The proud dad, who works as a project manager himself, added that he and his wife, Yang, alerted his in-laws to Kaleigh\u0027s condition on June 12.  After being joined at the hospital by their son Carson and Scott\u0027s mother at 3am, he said they sent a message to Yang\u0027s family in Manchester. They saw the message at 5am, started the journey at 5.30am, he said. Kaleigh was up and down during the night. Her stats became stable until the in-laws arrived at 8.30am, then they went up and down. It was at around 9.20am, less than an hour after her beloved relatives successfully made the trip down South, that \u0027princess\u0027 Kaleigh died. She was one of the longest-surviving UK patients with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), an inoperable paediatric brain tumour. She had been diagnosed with the deadly condition - which affects around 40 children every year and currently has no cure - in April 2016.  At the time, she was expected to live for only nine months. But defying medics\u0027 predictions, the little girl survived for more than two years. Following her death, she was cremated in a lovely service, which was carried out in Kaleigh\u0027s way and attended by hundreds of people. A beautiful celebration of life was later held in her honour. And as well as \u0027project managing\u0027 her own death, the youngster\u0027s family believe she \u0027guided\u0027 them to the perfect spot to bury her ashes. Even looking for her final resting place, she guided us all the way, said Scott, from Woodford Green, East London. We would have never imagined the place we did. Kaleigh\u0027s family had looked around several potential burial sites, but nothing was quite her. They then visited GreenAcres woodland cemetery.  In the corner of my eye, I spotted a tree in the middle of the green. The manager had never even seen that tree, recalled Scott. We said, \u0027Could Kaleigh be laid to rest here?\u0027 His daughter, who was treated at the capital\u0027s Great Ormond Street Hospital, now rests under the tree at the cemetery near Epping. Her ashes are buried near a pond, so she can feed the ducks, and are surrounded by grass moulds, which she can roll around on. It\u0027s so peaceful, she\u0027s the only one on the green, said her dad. We take our picnics down there and sit there to talk to her. Ahead of Kaleigh\u0027s celebration of life, her parents had taken little brother Carson to GreenAcres to show him his sister\u0027s resting place. We took him there before she was laid to rest, said Scott.  He was playing on his tablet and playing around. There\u0027s no sadness around there. It feels like Center Parcs, it feels like a golf course. He added that he and Yang, 38, didn\u0027t tell their son the full extent of his sibling\u0027s condition, saying: We didn\u0027t tell him the severity. He continued: Carson has been undergoing counselling. We told him everybody will go to Heaven one day. We told him his sister has gone off to do another mission - and that \u0027Your sister will always love you and you can talk to her whenever you want\u0027. Kaleigh, who enjoyed being a \u0027princess\u0027 and dancing, was diagnosed with DIPG after she complained of double vision following a cold. Her parents were eating breakfast with her at home when she suddenly laughed and told them that she could see two of them.  Concerned, they then noticed her left eye was turning slightly inwards. After seeking advice from an optician pal, the couple took their daughter to Moorfields Eye Hospital, where her double vision was confirmed. Specialists said the youngster\u0027s eye looked healthy, but told Scott and Yang that she should get checked out at a general hospital. Kaleigh was then taken to the Royal London Hospital, where a CT scan was carried out, followed by an MRI scan five hours later.  They explained the CT scan would happen today, Scott explained in an interview about his daughter with  last year.  But as it was a Saturday the MRI would be done on Monday. When the hospital called for the MRI team to come in that night I knew what they saw on the CT scan wasn\u0027t good. On Sunday, the consultants came round and told us not to worry as on Tuesday they would tell us what the treatment plan would be.  Tuesday came and that was when our world started to cave in and turned upside down. Scott and his wife were left horrified by their little girl\u0027s DIPG diagnosis. When I asked when do they operate, they said they couldn\u0027t, said Scott. When asked what we could do, they said radiotherapy. Once we left the room, we looked it up on the web and the statistics were just something that you couldn\u0027t imagine. He added that although he and Yang were told there was no known cure for the disease, they clung on to any glimmer of hope possible. Kaleigh underwent 30 sessions of radiotherapy followed by an eight-month honeymoond period before her double vision returned. She subsequently underwent a second round of radiotherapy, comprising 10 further treatments in January and February last year.  However, her double vision remained and she began suffering from a weak left hand, stuttering speech and very unbalanced walking. She also started experiencing more regular headaches. Her desperate parents took her to Mexico with Carson last April for intraarterial chemotherapy and immunotherapy experimental treatment. Kaleigh is the first foreign overseas patient in the world to receive this combination of treatment, Scott explained last year. The family returned from the Mexican facility, but flew back a number of times so that Kaleigh could undergo further treatment. This treatment was self-funded, costing tens of thousands of pounds, and still at an experimental stage, with no guarantees. But after the first and second rounds, the youngster was able to swim, do the monkey bars, hop on one foot and perform cartwheels. The size of her tumour was also reduced.  In January and March this year, Kaleigh travelled to the facility again. Her most recent trip was due to take place in May. However, the journey had to be postponed because she was too unwell. We knew that the only chance we ever really had was Mexico, Scott said. Even the day before we were due to fly, I was still adamant that we had to go, but at the last minute we pulled the plug. Kaleigh just wasn\u0027t well enough. The little girl then underwent a MRI scan and blood tests in the UK. The day before she fell into a deep unconscious state, she was still smiling, even giving a thumbs up to the medic taking her blood. But while being checked over by nurses and mummy, she suffered an internal haemorrhage inside her tumour and her heart rate dropped. She spent six weeks \u0027sleeping\u0027 in a coma until she passed away.  Scott said that while he has seen a lot of very cruel ways that children with DIPG pass away, his daughter had a peaceful death. Carson was in the room when she died, he added. Kaleigh was carried to her celebration of life by her doting mum. Her ashes were stored in a small box, featuring the words: Team Kaleigh. The celebration, which was captured in a series of stunning pictures by photographer David Solomans, was attended by 300 to 400 people. Attendees included family, friends, doctors, nurses and Bradley Lowery Foundation co-founder Lynn Murphy, who made a moving speech. It was amazing, just perfect, said Scott. He added that since the ceremony, loved ones have received a lot of signs that his daughter has reached her destination. The little girl loved coin pushers, with one family friend even bringing a machine to her when she couldn\u0027t travel to the seaside anymore.

Thomas Markle pulled out of his daughter\u0027s wedding just days after it emerged he had been paid to pose for pictures of his shopping for a wedding outfit and looking at pictured of Meghan and Harry. It was later revealed the 73-year-old had suffered a heart attack and was undergoing heart surgery. Now, a source close to the Duchess of Sussex has branded his heart surgery as a \u0027story\u0027, fabricated as a way out of the wedding. They said: The whole story about Meghan\u0027s father undergoing heart surgery was made up. He had to come up with a good enough reason not to attend her wedding and avoid any further embarrassment after those staged photos went public., reports the Mail Online.   Meghan Markle\u0027s dad Thomas vows he won\u0027t stop speaking to the media until Royals \u0027break their silence\u0027  The source added people should \u0027feel sorry for Meghan\u0027 as opposed to her father. Appearing on Good Morning Britain, Thomas, a former film lighting director, said he had checked into the Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center, north of the Mexican border. The hospital has since said \u0027no such name\u0027 was on their patient records. Thomas Markle has also said he won\u0027t stop speaking to the media until the Royals break their silence. He said he\u0027s unfazed by reports that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are growing \u0027frustrated\u0027 with his recent outspoken interviews about Meghan.   Meghan Markle and Prince Harry field VERY cheeky question from royal fan with the best comeback  Thomas told TMZ he simply wants to make peace with his estranged daughter. He said: I was silent for a full year and the press beat me up every day saying I was a hermit hiding in Mexico, so I gave my story. Apparently that interview put the Royal Family in their silence mode ... so, I gave another interview to break the silence. All they have to do is speak to me.” Thomas Markle also said that he is amused that he can force the Royal Family into a media blackout. Tomorrow [Wednesday] is my birthday, 74 years old, and I’m enjoying the fact that I can make the entire Royal Family not speak and maybe I can get a laugh out of the Duchess.   Thomas Markle \u0027wants to fly to the UK to make peace with Meghan\u0027 - days after saying she\u0027s hiding behind \u0027fake smile\u0027  Mr. Markle has given numerous interviews in recent months, including a paid interview with the Sun in which he revealed his daughter hasn\u0027t returned his calls for over two months. He also said that he thought that his the 36-year-old actress looked \u0027terrified\u0027 in her new life as a fully-fledged royal. I see it in her eyes, he said. I see it in her face and I see it in her smile. I\u0027ve seen her smile for years. I know her smile. I don\u0027t like the one I\u0027m seeing now. This one isn\u0027t even a stage smile - this is a pained smile. Sharon Osbourne has accused Thomas Markle of being an alcoholic who needs to \u0027get clean\u0027. Appearing on an American talk show, she urged him to stop humiliating Meghan and stop drinking.

The club at Ysgol Y Berllan Deg primary school in Llanedeyrn, Cardiff, has limited spaces for next year. Mums told Wales Online how important it was to them that their child was included with one saying I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B. The breakfast club is a government scheme aimed at providing young children with the opportunity of receiving a free, healthy breakfast at school each day. For many parents with a long commute it is vital as it allows them to drop their kids off early and get to work on time. The school opened its yearly applications for the next school year today and some parents were so worried about missing out they queued through the night outside the school gates.  Have you had a similar experience? Email webnews@trinitymirror   At the front of the queue was Annett Farrow from Carmarthen, whose grandchild goes to the school. “We have been on the road since 1am and got here at 3am,” she said. “My son and daughter-in-law are on holiday so we had to come. If it gets them a place it will have been worth it. “We have bought biscuits and crisps - the only problem is the toilets. We have been using the toilets in the hotel opposite.”  For some parents like Leanne Taylor, who has been in her chair since 3.30am, there is no backup plan. She said: “I have two children, one of whom is starting in reception in September. “I had to do this last year when it did rain a bit. I had only moved into my house two days before and I didn’t have internet. I planned to bring my laptop and do some work while I waited. The police turned up and asked what I was doing.”  According to Leanne there is no other option for her if she wants to maintain her career. She said: “For some it is essential. I work opposite Tredegar House and I drive in. If I drop them off at 8.30 I won’t be getting into work until 10 because of the traffic. “If I didn’t have this I would not be able to go to work- I can’t risk not getting a place, I don’t have a plan B. “It is a really good school and I don’t think there is a fairer way to do it. “To do it you literally have to walk in and hand a form in. They then write what number you were in the queue on the form. “The ones that are here first are the ones that need it most. It gets longer and earlier because the people who did not get a place last year will get here earlier this year.” Another parent, who did not want to be named, said that in previous years it had been slightly different.  “It is a big talking point among parents,” she said. “You get a text two weeks before and then a letter. It goes straight in the diary. I have been doing this for two years and this is the biggest queue I have seen. “I don’t know how a single parent would be able to do it as they would have to bring their children with them. “In previous years people have bought multiple forms for friends and that has been banned because it wasn’t fair on the people who queued up. The atmosphere is much nicer this year.” "},{"url":null,"title":"no wonder double glazing salesmen","story":"NewsLying double glazing fraudster blew profits on designer clothes, private school fees and flights to Las VegasNo wonder the replacement window industry has such a bad reputation - court cases reveal range of lying, cheating, bullying sales tactics\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew Penman07:16, 19 JUL 2018Updated11:58, 19 JUL 2018NewsBoxing fan Zulkernan Mahmood with Floyd Mayweather\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIf there are many more cases like these then the double glazing industry will be in danger of getting a bad name. First up is Zulkernan Mahmood, who raked in \u0026pound1.2million a year with his intimidating sales tactics. Despite boasting of a “seamless and problem-free installation every time” on his website, customers were left with shoddy doors and windows fitted by incompetent workers who sometimes left a trail of damage. Mahmood’s reps got customers to pay in full before installation by removing existing windows and demanding the balance “with the implication that the replacement windows would not be installed unless payment was made”, as trading standards officers put it. Other nasty tactics included: *Taking unauthorised payments from customers’ bank cards. When challenged the firm said this was to pay VAT – despite not being VAT registered. *Leaving jobs unfinished. *Ignoring complaints. *Failing to provide safety glass in locations where it was required by law. *Lying about belonging to an industry accreditation body.  Boxing fan Mahmood spent some of the money he made flying to Las Vegas to watch Floyd Mayweather, posting the pictures on Twitter, plus flights to Istanbul and Paris, private school fees and designer clothes. The 30-year-old from Bradford admitted fraud and consumer protection offences following a joint operation by police, trading standards and adult social care workers in West Yorkshire. He was given a suspended 15-month jail sentence and ordered to pay almost \u0026pound65,000 in costs and compensation.  Mike Walsh, prosecuting on behalf of West Yorkshire Trading Standards, told Leeds crown court that damning evidence found during raids on his home and business included a text message in which the shyster wrote: “We’ve become a complete cowboy outlet”. After the trial Linda Davis, head of the West Yorkshire Financial Exploitation and Abuse Team, said: “This case highlights the unfair and fraudulent \u0026shypractices that rogue traders will use against unsuspecting, often \u0026shyvulnerable, consumers.”  Mahmood traded as UKHI Limited, UK Home Improvements and Energy Efficient Double Glazing and previously worked for double glazing giant Safestyle UK, which brings me to the second case. On Monday, in another prosecution brought by West Yorkshire trading standards, Safestyle was fined \u0026pound120,000 in a trial that exposed a dreadful range of bullying, cheating ploys to get work.  In one of the most damning \u0026shyjudgments I’ve heard in a consumer case, Judge Robert Moore told \u0026shySheffield crown court that for two years the firm did not control its staff. “The offences were literally all over the country,” he said. “They frequently involved preying on the more vulnerable and often elderly. “There were lies and forceful calls deliberately wearing customers down. Faulty work was left \u0026shyunrepaired and there was unpleasantness and perseverance.” In one case the rep challenged a reluctant customer to a fight.  In another, when a homeowner objected to an unsolicited visit and pointed to her “No cold-callers” door sticker, the rep said that this did not apply to him “as it didn’t say no cold-calling from Safestyle UK”. An 88-year-old woman was \u0026shypressurised into giving her phone number by a rep who stood with “pen and paper repeating her dialling code”. And an 84-year-old man was told there would be “trouble” if he cancelled after phoning to complain about the cost. Safestyle UK, a trading name of HPAS Limited, admitted 13 unfair trading offences on day two of the trial. The court heard that it now has a new chief executive, Michael Gallacher, and a new chief financial officer. The judge said: “They have a lot to do.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince george pictures young royals","story":"NewsBest photos of Prince George - young royal\u0027s most adorable snaps as he turns fiveThird in line to the throne is already racking up the air miles on royal tours and meeting with foreign dignitaries\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew SnellHomepage Editor16:52, 19 JUL 2018Updated17:05, 19 JUL 2018NewsPrince George in Hamburg in 2017 (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince George has barely started school, but he\u0027s already one of the most famous children in the world. The young royal - who turns five on Sunday - is third in line to the throne after dad Prince William and grandad Prince Charles. And that means he\u0027s already racking up the air miles on royal tours and meeting with foreign dignitaries. He\u0027s also welcomed two younger siblings, as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expand their family. To celebrate his birthday, here\u0027s the most adorable snaps of Prince George over the last five years. The first picture  Prince George made his first appearance to the public just hours after his birth on 22 July 2013. Proud parents William and Kate showed off their newborn for the cameras as they left the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital in west London.  The prince was christened at the Chapel Royal in St James\u0027s Palace on October 23, 2013.  He was dressed in the traditional gown worn by all royals at their christenings, which is a replica of the robe made in 1841 for Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter.  On tour in Australia  George\u0027s first royal tour abroad came in April 2014, when the Cambridges visited new Zealand and Australia for three weeks. The young prince delighted fans in Australia, and was snapped here at Sydney\u0027s Taronga Zoo where an animal called a bilby was named after him.  There aren\u0027t many people that would show up for a meeting with Barack Obama in their dressing gown. The US President met the future king just before bedtime during a visit to the UK in April 2016. Meeting sister Charlotte  George\u0027s sister, Princess Charlotte, was born 2 May 2015 at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital. And one of her first visitors was her big brother, who was taken to the hospital by dad Prince William.  A talkative Prince George was seen chatting to his great-grandmother the Queen at his sister\u0027s christening at St Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham, in July 2015.  The red shorts he wore were a throw-back to the outfit his dad Prince William wore to the christening of Prince Harry 30 years earlier.  With the Red Arrows  Prince George is a fan of planes, and on a visit to the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford in Gloucestershire he got the chance to sit in one of the Red Arrows. The excited prince was lifted into the cockpit by his dad at the air show in July 2016. Playing with his dog  To mark his third birthday in 2016, the royals released this adorable picture of George playing with his dog Lupo. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have had the pooch since 2012. The photo caused controversy when people saw the young prince was feeding his dog ice cream. On tour in Canada  George went on his second royal tour in October 2016 - this time to Canada.  But the prince was too shy to high-five a young fan he met there.  Schoolboy Daniel Brachman, 9, said: “I tried to high five him but he didn’t want to. Prince George in a helicopter  Prince George got the chance to sit in a rescue helicopter during atrip to Hamburg in July 2017. His dad William was a search and rescue pilot with the RAF for three years.  Starting school is a big step for any child, but George didn\u0027t look nervous as he walked in for his first day at Thomas\u0027s school in West London. The prince was dropped off by dad William in September 2017. Meeting brother Louis  The youngest of the Cambridge children was born on 23 April, and George and sister Charlotte were amongst the first visitors. George was wearing his school uniform as William took him to see new brother Louis at the Lindo Wing of St Mary\u0027s Hospital.

So we searched the country and found four SMOPs (Smart Meter Opponents) who revealed their worries to us. We heard the same issues over and over again. Security, inaccurate bills and both home and data safety were all common themes. In a bid to alleviate their concerns and iron out any undue fears, we invited our SMOPs to a round-the-table discussion with an expert equiped to answer their questions.  Audrey Gallacher, from industry body Energy UK, was on hand to chat about topics that were most prevalent on our SMOPs’ minds and to explain the positive impact smart meters can have on their lives, the future and how they could fundamentally save them money. But our SMOPs were armed with tough questions and pushed our expert hard, determined to discover if smart meters really are the way forward. So what did they ask?  Paul, 61, a sales manager from Manchester, said: “I’ve been very concerned about smart meter security and openly sceptical about the real cost saving benefits for a long time.” His feelings were echoed by foster mum Sarah, 50, from Herts. “I’ve always thought they would be more of a hindrance than a help,” she said. But as the conversation evolved and Audrey, Director of Retail Energy Supply, addressed each of our SMOP’s very genuine worries, it soon became evident that despite their initial fears they gradually began to understand how smart meters really could have a positive benefit on their everyday lives.  Paula, 50, who lives with her partner, Ian, 48, and is carer to her elderly and poorly mum Doreen, 80, said: “I really wasn’t sure what to expect but it was encouraging to see Audrey was very receptive to our fairly tough questions.” The mum of one, who lives in a remote area and often has her four-year-old granddaughter Scarlett, to stay was at first anxious about having unknown fitters come into her home. She said: “I was worried about leaving myself and my family in a very vulnerable situation.” Expert confirmed engineers are heavily vetted  Audrey reassured our SMOPs that all engineers are heavily vetted and follow rigorous regulations and guidelines to ensure customers’ safety remains the highest priority. Paula said: “I felt so much better being reassured from someone who works so closely with Smart Energy GB that no fitter would be able to walk in before being fully trained to an extremely high level.” Another common concern was that the initial installation of a modern smart meter would be invasive and time-consuming. Sarah, a busy volunteer, said: “I’d assumed it was a full day’s job and my carpets and floorboards would need lifting that would cause mess and disruption.” She was pleasantly surprised to discover the process only takes approximately two hours and that the smart meters are usually positioned in the same spot as your old meter. Stay-at- home dad, Edward, 27,from South Wales, was still sceptical as to how he could really save money. Smart meter safety code in place  Audrey explained how the data provided on the in-home display indicates when customers are using more than average amounts of energy, allowing them to make changes and assess whether they needed to be using all the appliances causing a surge. She revealed how smart meter customers will be offered competitive tariffs and be able to swap suppliers with ease.

Cherie Harris and James Mainwaring enlisted the help of a food waste charity to create a delicious menu for their reception last Saturday. The menu was made up entirely of food heading for the bin. The green-minded couple, aided by The Real Junk Food Project, wanted their wedding to have as little mark on the environment as possible. They did this by leaving no food waste - and also saved money in the process, with the cost for the food thought to be just \u0026pound6 a head. Cherie and James initially didn\u0027t tell their guests who provided the catering for their reception at a village hall in Leeds, West Yorkshire.  The bride, 36, said: We wanted the food to speak for itself. We did not tell our guests what they were eating until the speeches. They were very surprised but also very impressed. The food was absolutely beautiful and really made our day. We could not have asked for anything better. In fact, the beauty of a spread delivered by the RJFP is that the customer never really knows what they are going to get. It is all down to the luck of what comes into the warehouse. At the weekend, Cherie and James\u0027s guests were treated to a sit-down hot buffet which was fit for kings at East Keswick Village Hall. They had spinach and chickpea curry, chicken and bacon pies, sausage and bean cassoulet, ratatouille and cold meats and pickles.  Other dishes included a cheese board, oven roasted thyme and lemon chicken and tortilla cups filled with Mexican salad (gallo d\u0027pico) - all created from scratch by the RJFP team. These were accompanied by a selection of tasty salads, pasta dishes and veggies - with veggie cakes and a Greggs donut tower for dessert. RJFP food is collected from supermarkets, sandwich chains and fast food outlets, using items they would have to throw out because of their own health and safety regulations. All of this food is still perfectly fine for human consumption, and no laws are being broken by feeding guests with it. The charity uses the food to cater nationally for events, feed customers in pay-as-you-feel cafes and stock pay-as-you-feel supermarkets. It also uses it to supply food for schools. Emma Buckle, Events Co-ordinator of RJFP Leeds, said the organisation would be aware that it has a wedding on its books, so would do its best to freeze any food it wishes to put away for the wedding.  Other than that, it relies a lot on praying to the food fairies for certain ingredients to come in - and it usually does, she added. The menu the charity creates for the special day is made up entirely from junk food, with not a single ingredient ever purchased. Cherie worked as a carer until she went on maternity leave after the birth of her and James\u0027s baby daughter, Iona,15 weeks ago. She had booked the catering for their wedding a year ago. She and saxophonist James, 29, who plays for the popular band Roller Trio, had a menu featuring a mix of veggie, vegan and meat feasts. The mum-of-one, from Leeds, said: When we looked at other food options you can find that menus are rather limited, with the RJFP the possibilities are endless. You get a range of food that is beautiful, original and delicious. The couple\u0027s guests were spoiled with meals concocted by brilliant chefs used to thinking on their feet to prepare delicious food from waste.  Our working conditions are like an episode of Ready Steady Cook, Emma said. And using food destined for landfill is relatively cheap. Of course, there still has to be payment for the food preparation, as well as staffing and collection costs. But because the food has come free, the costs are low. Prices start from a cold buffet costing as little as \u0026pound5 a head, with a hot one costing \u0026pound6 a head. Emma said: This is food that really does not cost the earth. It is not only plastic waste that is bad for the environment. Even food, when it breaks down, emits greenhouse gasses, including carbon dioxide and methane. Saturday\u0027s buffet, going on 250g per person, saved 35 kilos of waste.

Emelia Holden was sorting out menus when the man walked behind her and brazenly squeezed her rear. Livid by what had happened, Emelia sprung into action, grabbed the man by the neck of his T-shirt and slammed him on a nearby chair before giving him a piece of her mind. Quick-thinking Emelia said: I just did what I felt was best. I took the guy down and had my co-workers call the police. As soon as the cops saw the CCTV footage, they immediately arrested the man. He sat in jail until Monday so in my opinion, he got what he deserved.  All that I want from my experiences is for women to know that it\u0027s okay to stand up for yourself. She added: You have every right to wear what you want and you most certainly have every right to defend yourself. The incident, which happened in a matter of seconds, was caught on CCTV. Police were called to the scene and a man was immediately arrested after cops were shown the footage. The incident took place at Vinne Van GoGo\u0027s pizza restaurant in downtown Savannah, Georgia, just before 11pm on Saturday, June 30.  The man was released on Monday, July 2. The CCTV video begins by showing waitress Emelia taking another table\u0027s order in the patio area of the restaurant. She finishes taking the table\u0027s orders and takes their menus back to the restaurant counter. As she does this, the male customer begins walking towards her. While Emelia sorts out the restaurant menus and order pads, the man reaches his left arm out and grabs her bottom. He then walks away but Emelia immediately chases after him. She grabs him by the back of his red t-shirt and puts him in a headlock- before pushing the man down to the ground.

It\u0027s a call for celebration - but how people choose to celebrate this can vary drastically.  There\u0027s always been a tradition some mothers have chosen to follow after giving birth , whereby they eat the placenta.   Or if they don\u0027t eat it , they might do something else with it.  Some have turned it into teddy bears, some have made Christmas decorations - but now there\u0027s a new trend emerging. Mums are now using their afterbirth to plant trees. Yep, you read that right. But how do they do this? With an invention called a Bios Capsule.    The capsule is a biodegradable conical device in which you put soil and a seed to grow. It is separated into two sections, with room in the bottom to add something special to the mix.  Originally designed to hold the ashes of loved ones (Bios Urn), a company called Happy Birth Tree is now encouraging new parents to add the placenta after giving birth.  Once the placenta, soil and seed are in the urn, you simply plant it and water it just as you would any other plant. People are able to choose whichever kind of seed they want for their tree - from a grand oak to a pretty rose bush. The idea for the placenta tree was devised by Bryce Roberts, following the death of his beloved dog.

The men spotted the boy, called Danya, as he climbed onto a table and opened a fourth floor latch while his grandmother was babysitting him. His terrifying 40ft fall was caught on CCTV in the Russian town of Dzerzhinsk. Workmen Dmitry, 47, and Vadim, 30, had just had a break from tarring the road outside the child’s block of flats. One of them told local media: First the head of the child appeared in the fourth floor window.  “Then the legs. We ran under the window and at this moment he fell. We caught him and softened the blow. “He burst into tears, but did not lose consciousness. I called the ambulance.” The shocked grandmother looked out of the window then his aunt rushed downstairs to get the child. The boy was taken to hospital but released soon afterwards with only a bandaged knee. In a separate incident in nearby St Petersburg, a girl aged five was plucked to safety after climbing out of a ninth floor window on an enclosed balcony. The child went out after being left home alone, locked inside the flat while her parents were out. Her feet were supported by a tiny ledge as she clung on for 20 minutes as police and neighbours tried to break into her flat. Industrial climber Felix Gurin, 24, was working on another block carrying out high rise repairs, and heard the girls screams.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/04/08mgjmorr_9734107-863x575.jpg ","title":"dundee supermarket works with autism charity to launch quiet hour for customers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee supermarket is set to introduce a quieter hour in-store for customers who are sensitive to music and other noises associated with busy shops.Morrisons on Afton Way is rolling out the quieter period every Saturday from 9am-10am.The initiative, dreamed up with the support of the National Autistic Society, has been designed to accommodate people with autism who can find the noisy clamour of shops stressful.Morrisons carried out trials in three stores across the UK earlier this year in order to work out what makes shopping stressful for those with autism and to figure out a time that is convenient.During the Quieter Hour, Dundee’s Morrisons store will have its lights dimmed, its music switched off, the frequency of announcements reduced and a reduction in the movement of trolleys and baskets.Checkout beeps and other electrical noises will also be turned down, and the Quieter Hour will be clearly advertised with a poster at the store’s front entrance.Staff are being briefed on the anxieties customers with autism can face when shopping, in order to improve their understanding of the issues.The National Autistic Society said Quieter Hour was “a step in the right direction”.Morrisons Dundee store manager Colin Thomson added: “Our initial trials showed there is a need for a quieter shopping experience.

We trained twice on Friday so there were heavy legs,” he said.“I think we have to play quicker football, especially in the front. We kept the ball too long in the midfield.“And I think it is more important for that, although some people will be disappointed with the result, we look at some of the decisions we made in the game.“We had 1-0 and the game in hand. Then we make a mistake and let them back in.”Csaba, though, remains confident a team he is still building will come together over the next few weeks.“I have to say this team needs a little bit of patience and time. We are not finished with the recruitment.“We’ve got Adam Barton now and we need definitely one player more in the central defence and also a striker.”Barton signed up on a two-year deal from Partick Thistle, who agreed to cancel his contract and let him head for United as part of the cost-cutting process they’ve implemented in the wake of relegation from the Premiership.That left Csaba delighted to snatch a player from an outfit who could be among his big rivals in the league campaign.“I am very happy that Adam has made the decision to come to us because he is a player who can play in central midfield and also in the centre of the defence.”Meanwhile, United pair James Keatings and Paul McMullan have been linked with moves away.Former club Hamilton are reported to be keen on Keatings, while Partick Thistle are said to want former Celtic wide man McMullan at Firhill.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44857272341-e1531222515578-803x564.jpg ","title":"fans given chance to say last goodbye to dundee legend alan gilzean as casket laid in dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans are being invited to pay their last respects to club legend Alan Gilzean ahead of his funeral.The ceremony will take place at Dundee Crematorium on Friday at 12.30pm, with close family and friends invited.Ahead of the ceremony, \u0026#8216Gillie\u0026#8217s\u0026#8217 family have allowed Dees a chance to say goodbye to the man who was part of the 1962 league winning side.His casket will be laid in the Alan Gilzean lounge within Dens Park tonight from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.Supporters looking to go along can enter the stadium through the Main Door beside the reception.On Friday Alan\u0026#8217s body will pass Dens Park one last time around 11.55am as the funeral cortege goes down the Provost Road.It will also pass Dens Road, Strathmartine Road, Clepington Road, McAlpine Road before making its way to the crematorium.Supporters are again invited to pay their respects along the route.Alan Gilzean made 190 appearances for Dundee and scored a remarkable 169 goals, making him to this day the side’s all-time top scorer.After his seven years in the Dark Blue of Dundee he moved to Tottenham where he also became a legend.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former celtic man toshney completes move from dundee united to arbroath","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United defender Lewis Toshney has completed a loan move to Arbroath.The versatile defender has joined the Lichties until January.The 26-year-old Dundonian, who began his career at Celtic,  has also played for Ross County, Cowdenbeath and Raith Rovers as well as having loan spells at Kilmarnock and Dundee.Toshney, who has represented Scotland at Under 17, Under 19 and Under 21 levels, joined Dundee United from Raith Rovers and made his debut at Arbroath\u0026#8217s Gayfield ground in the Betfred Cup in July 2016.He was absent from Saturday\u0026#8217s 1-1 draw with Arbroath at Tannadice which saw the visitors win a bonus point after a 5-3 on penalty shoot out win in the opening game of  the Betfred Cup.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nearly 1000 more folk in dundee signing on for benefits","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe number of Dundonians signing on for out-of-work benefits in the last 12 months has risen by almost 1,000.Statistics show 995 more people are claiming either Universal Credit or “old-style” Jobseeker’s Allowance than this time last year.A total of 4,350 people, representing 4.6% of the working-age population, are claiming – up from 3,355.The figures represent the continuation of a trend which has seen claimant counts rise almost monthly since November, from a low of 3.1% that month.However, in the long term, the number of people signing on has fallen by 10% since the last significant change of Westminster government in 2010.Jane McEwen, work coach team leader at Dundee’s Jobcentre Plus, said this was down to changes in how benefit figures are recorded.“Full service” Universal Credit rolled out in Dundee last November, replacing six “old-style” benefits such as Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA).Families of up to two adults and two children are now processed on the new system and count towards the total number of claimants.This applies even if they aren’t claiming JSA but are looking for work while claiming payments such as housing benefit or tax credits, which now fall under Universal Credit.Jane said: “We issue comparison figures for each year but there’s a caveat with those because we went full service in November. We think that accounts for much of the increase.“It will likely only be in December, or even January next year, that we can start comparing like-for-like.”Local Jobcentres have made efforts to team up with local employers to offer opportunities to those searching for work.Recently, Tayside branches have been working with ABP Food Group in Perth, 2 Sisters Food Group in Coupar Angus and are making inroads with the Scottish Government to recruit for Dundee’s new Social Security Agency.In addition, Jobcentre Plus staff are laid on at the Central Library to help people with “soft skills” such as IT literacy, writing a CV and attending interviews.Jane conceded that Universal Credit, which is self-managed online, had presented issues for those not IT literate.“For those that struggle with this, we will try to help them,” she said.UK employment is at a record high of 75.7%, according to the DWP.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4c5d1fbe2e3-480x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann hails super stop from keeper jack hamilton on dundee debut","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann hailed the stopping power of new goalie Jack Hamilton as he claimed a debut clean sheet.By the end of their 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion which started their Betfred Cup campaign, the Dark Blues were cruising to victory.However, with the game at 0-0 and 1-0, the League Two side had chances to turn the game their way.Their best effort came from the head of Jason Marr shortly after half-time but his powerful effort was well saved by new boy Hamilton with the keeper up quickly again to stop the rebound.After that Sofien Moussa added his second of the game before debutant Jean Mendy and Craig Wighton goals capped a good start to the season for Dundee.Boss Neil said: “I’m delighted, absolutely delighted.“I said before the game that this was the season started for real now, there’s no more warm-ups.“First of all, you want to win the game and then, afterwards, put on a bit of a show and score some goals so I’m pleased we did that.“Stirling made it really difficult at times and it took a brilliant double stop from big Jack Hamilton, which is exactly why we brought him to the club. When he wasn’t used that much he makes a super stop at 1-0. We got a wee bit of a jolt and away we went.“I’m really pleased, clean sheet, four goals and the front three scoring – I’m delighted.“We were trying to work the ball through the middle of the park, the boys coming in for their competitive debuts looked good as well so, all in all, I’m pleased.”As well as Hamilton and Mendy, there also were debuts for Nathan Ralph and Elton Ngwatala from the start with the latter replaced by another new boy Karl Madianga.And Neil was happy to see them all make an impact, Mendy especially as he got off to a goalscoring start.“He’s direct and the most important thing for me is he has an end product,” the Dens gaffer added.“His finish was actually brilliant, he reversed it into the corner and you can see he’s got that eye for goal.“He’s really intelligent, he’s not a young boy we’ve brought in or somebody at the twilight of his career – he’s at a real good age.“Elton showed real good glimpses of his power and pace.

A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We are going for a victory.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Gjen_Lochee_Roadworks.JPG-846x564.jpg ","title":"too much at one time locals claim roadworks on busy dundee street is adding 20 minutes to short journey","story":"\t\t\t\t\tResidents living beside a busy Dundee street are fuming over new roadworks which have left them facing lengthy diversions.They spoke out after Coupar Angus Road was shut to southbound traffic from the South Road roundabout, down Lochee High Street bypass to the junction with Loon’s Road, from July 10.It is the second round of closures for the area, after a section of the same road was closed for a number of weeks.Residents have complained, saying that the work has added up to 20 minutes to their regular journeys.They claim a diversion sign was placed on the road – but had been removed and was now in the nearby Lidl car park.Taxi driver Jim Leaburn, 68, said he was being criticised by customers for taking longer routes to avoid the closure.He added: “They have done too much here at one time.

Initially, staff offered her the opportunity to continue her journey through to Leuchars, from where she would then be driven by taxi to her destination.But due to the short time between her arrival in Dundee and the start of her meeting, she said that alternative was unworkable.

I am quite concerned about how disabled people and those who struggle with stairs and escalators are supposed to be able to leave the platform at this brand new station if the lift breaks.

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 6:35

But the other side of that is actually having to leave here.“I certainly wasn’t booted out the door. Unfortunately, in football you feel your time comes to an end at certain periods in your career and you have to move on and we felt it was the right time for everyone.“The reason I came here, and I had other options, was to work with the Gaffer. We’ve had a great relationship and this is the happiest I’ve been at any club throughout my career.

years","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA collection of rare images detailing the journey of Aberdeen buses through the decades has been unveiled in a new book.The photos, some which are previously unpublished, show the progression of bus transport in Aberdeen from the 1960s onwards.Written by Peter Findlay, Peter McCutcheon and Steven Pirie, Aberdeen Corporation Transport and its Successors looks at buses in the fleet that have been a familiar site in the city throughout the years.The men are all from Aberdeen – Peter Findlay worked in public transport for more than 40 years, Mr McCutcheon is a retired bus driver with 36 years’ experience at Aberdeen Corporation Transport, Grampian Regional Transport and First Bus, while Mr Pirie describes himself as a “keen bus enthusiast”.Mr Findlay said: “We (the three authors) have known each other since the mid 70s when attending meetings of the Aberdeen Transport Society. We are all retired but continue to have an interest in transport.”He has previously published two books, the first featuring the buses of Alexanders’ Northern (subsequently known as Northern Scottish) which operated across the north-east of Scotland, the second covering independent bus and coach companies in the Grampian area. He added: “Worthy of note is that it is 120 years since the Corporation Tramways were formed, 60 years since the last tram operated.“First Group Heritage Trust along with Aberdeen and District Transport Preservation Trust (The Bus Collection at Alford) and Aberdeen Transport Society are preserving the heritage of the Corporation and other companies of the north-east.”The book, which was published by Amberley Publishing and released earlier this week, looks at bus transport in the city up to 1998 and features images curated by the authors with additional photographs from Bob McGillivray.Before First Bus Aberdeen, there was Aberdeen Corporation Transport and its successor Grampian Transport, which was run under the department of the Grampian Regional Authority.Aberdeen Corporation Transport was formed in 1898 when the company first started operating tram routes in the Granite City.The Corporation bus fleet came to be after the full closure of the tram network in 1958. The trams were burned on the Queen’s Links in May that year with only two cars preserved.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

We thank road users for their patience in advance and encourage them to plan ahead by checking the Traffic Scotland website for real-time journey information.’Real-time journey planning information can be obtained by visiting www.trafficscotland.org or twitter @trafficscotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"kyles hammer home a win against caberfeidh","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowMarine Harvest PremiershipKyles Athletic returned to Tighnabruaich for the first time this season and they marked the occasion with a 5-1 win over Caberfeidh.Kyles Athletic boss James Perlich was still without the injured Roddy MacDonald, while Andrew King completed a two-match suspension. His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"shetland comes to cairndow","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 3:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFilm crews were once again spotted in Argyll with the cast of famed BBC series Shetland hot on their heels.After the excitement of Love me to Death filming in Inveraray and Lochgilphead last month, Silverprint Pictures’ made its way to Cairndow to film Shetland\u0026#8217s fifth series this week.The series, which has previously aired on BBC 1, is a dramatisation of the murder mystery novels by Ann Cleeves.Shooting took place on Ardkinglas Estate, inside and outside Ardkinglas House.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strone point roadworks are completed","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 18/07/18, 6:51 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA £1.6m project to improve road safety on the A83 at Strone Point at Inveraray has been completed.Around 370m of carriageway has been realigned and a section of the hillside scaled back, widening the road and improving driver visibility.Drainage systems have been upgraded to improve resilience in wet conditions, and new safety barriers and bike guards have also been installed.Cabinet Secretary for Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity Michael Matheson said: ‘The section of the A83 at Strone Point on Loch Fyne is single carriageway with a history of fatal and serious accidents.

I’d got it into my head the fact that this talk of \u0026#8220health and safety gone mad\u0026#8221 is just silly. We do actually need these things.\u0026#8216When you went into the history of these mines, you could see that we need every safety and health provision in the book because some very nasty things have happened. Even in very small mines, you can get a tunnel that can collapse or a flash flood and that’s possibly the end of somebody.’Marian added: ‘The many different mining ventures throughout the West Highlands in the past were often much more about lining the pockets of speculators than enriching the lives of the local communities.‘Themes of social justice are most important to me, especially when I can show the parallels between past and present lives.’Marian was raised in Glasgow but has hopped all across the globe, living in Perthshire, France, Italy, Lanarkshire and, for the past 20 years, Argyll, contributing with tutoring in English and communications at Argyll College.Journalism took her around the world, covering the effects of conflict and natural disasters on communities, which is evident in her book covering the effect of an often dangerous industry on a community.In terms of looking to the future, Marian is keeping coy. ‘There’s all sorts of ideas going on and I’m hoping to move on with pretty soon.‘I’m doing creative writing courses for the college and that’s actually a great deal of fun because it takes me out of that zone. If you\u0026#8217re supporting people as their talents grow, that is superb and we have very talented writers of poetry and fiction in this area so it’s great to be able to nurture that.’PIC:10 books, probably 10 cakes later. 08_a29marianpallister02Not a Plack the Richer is the story of Argyll\u0026#8217s mining industry. 08_a29marianpallister05Marian Pallister was signing copies of her new book for fans. 08_a29marianpallister06\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrs oldest pub black bull","story":"NewsAyr’s oldest pub, the Black Bull, shuts AGAIN leaving furious staff in wage rowThe Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:33, 17 JUL 2018NewsShift manager Charlotte Forsyth, manager Jose Ruiz and barmaid Jade Taylor, with barmaid/ waitress Tori McDicken (front, left) and barmaid Dianne McConnachie (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr’s oldest pub has shut AGAIN leaving furious staff claiming they have been left out of pocket. The Black Bull on River Street was first opened in 1754 and has survived many turmoils in its time, including a blaze that broke out in 2014. But last Thursday, workers were told mid-shift to collect their belongings and leave, with the tenant having been given no warning of the foreclosure. Now, employees have joined a hospitality union to fight for what they are owed – and their boss has stated “they will get paid”. Day-shift manager, 23-year-old Charlotte Forsyth, was mid-shift when the pub’s owners, Rosemount Taverns, marched in and said they were shutting up shop. Charlotte told the Post: “I was in for about two hours and the head from Rosemount Taverns turned up and said: ‘I need the keys – I’m changing the locks, my joiner’s on his way.’  “I was crying and everything. “I’ve only be there for just over a month and I’ve not been paid a penny. “I still have bills to pay like everybody else. “I would not have left a stable job had I thought that in a month I’d be talking about signing on – it’s not on. Tenant Scott Burnell, of Glasgow, claimed he knew nothing about the decision to close and confirmed staff will receive outstanding wages. Mr Burnell said: “It wasn’t my decision at all – the pub company wanted to (close). “It came as a shock to me – I didn’t know anything about it until after it had actually happened.  “The wages haven’t come through yet – it’s a four-week cycle. “They were paid two weeks ago and they’ll be due to get paid in two weeks’ time – and they will be paid. “I’ll be 100 per cent honest – I’m going to have to find that money from somewhere else.” Furious workers took to social media to vent their anger after receiving information that claimed Mr Burnell had previously outed other workers of a job and money. Mr Burnell denied the claims and said: “I know what they’re saying on Facebook and that is not the case at all. “I don’t set out to rip anybody off – I had no idea that pub was closing yesterday. “Pubs do run into trouble – it happens – I’m not going to run away from this.”  Distraught barmaid and mum-of-two Dianne McConnachie said: “I’ve got children to feed and a roof to put over my head. “I live in a private let with a private landlord so I can be punted out any time. “Myself and colleague Jade are single parents – we’re the only people bringing money into our houses. “So what do we do? Do we go and sign on?” Boss Mr Burnell added: “The pub was closed down because it was losing so much money. “It was a disaster in terms of the administration and financial control of the pub from the management. “I think the level of incompetence and mismanagement was horrific.  “And then we discovered they’d been buying stuff on credit. There’s nothing wrong with that, that wasn’t their fault but I found another \u0026pound4000 in credit that hadn’t been paid for – it was absolutely out of control. “I was told on Friday morning the debt to the brewery was \u0026pound720 and by Tuesday afternoon, it had risen to \u0026pound4000. “It didn’t make any sense. “I’ve got a list of about \u0026pound500/ \u0026pound600 of advances paid out so they were not telling you that. “I know it looks bad for me and I’m prepared to accept that, but it’s not as black and white.”  Bryan Simpson, Unite Hospitality Organiser said: “This is not the first time that Scott Burnell has tried to cut and run with his workers’ hard-earned wages, but it will certainly be the last. “As the Director of Wire Inns, Idlewild and The Raven Hotel, he already owes thousands of pounds to former workers in unpaid wages. “Unite will continue to support our members at the Black Bull to get what they’re entitled to. “We have received assurances from the leaseholders of the pub – Rosemount Taverns – that as soon as they find new tenants for the pub they will endeavour to keep the staff in their jobs.” Rosemount Taverns were unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.

Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

She was one of those selected to appear before the casting directors working on the new Legoland theme park TV and cinema advertisement. Having landed a part, she was cast as an excited youngster exploring the park in the advert. Scarlett, who is a pupil at Troon Primary, had to travel to London for a full day filming session. The theme of the new Legoland campaign focuses on their ‘Deep Sea Adventure’ and Scarlett is seen on board a submarine exploring the ocean and seeing Lego sea creatures swimming around. Scarlett said: “It was a really exciting experience to be involved with the production and I had such a great time.

Our team works with casting directors and producers from the world of TV, radio, cinema and advertising and regularly approach us for casting candidates. “We’ve had students in big campaigns for big brands such as RBS, Legoland, Skoda and Aldi, to name but a few. The involvement gives our students an amazing insight into the behind the scenes production of ads as well as TV programmes, radio shows and movies. We’ve had our students appear alongside real Hollywood big stars such as Rihanna, Nicole Kidman, and Colin Firth as well as music artistes including Kylie Minogue, Rod Stewart and Michael Buble. This amazing Legoland project was a lot of fun to be involved with and even more fun for Scarlett as she’s now starring in it!

A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

Your Safety. Your Choice.\u0026#8217The Royal Highland Education Trust (RHET) addressed the importance of getting children on farms to find out where their food comes from and that, with the right planning and precautions, they can be safe, fun and educational places.Carole Brunton, farmer and RHET Fife CI project coordinator, is in charge of organising farm visits throughout Fife, making sure that the farms, teachers and children are all ready for a fun, safe and educational experience.Her top tip for having children on farms is: \u0026#8216Common sense and plenty of planning.\u0026#8217Carole said: \u0026#8216For us, farm safety is extremely important. For the children’s safety, for the farmer’s reputation, and for RHET because if we had one accident on one farm it would stop all farm visits. We don’t want that to happen, so we have a strict regime.\u0026#8216We have a risk assessment process that we go through which we do with the farmer before the children are anywhere near the farm. Then we do a pre-visit with the teacher.\u0026#8216We go out with the teacher and the farmer and we do a pre-visit so that everyone knows what’s going to happen on the day when the children arrive.\u0026#8216On the day of the visit the farmer will make sure there’s no dangerous machinery sitting out or there’s not a hole being dug near to where we’ll be. We work closely with the host to make the site as safe as possible.\u0026#8216I would say common sense and supervision are the main things for any farm visit. We don’t want to make it all rules and regulations, so they can’t enjoy themselves. But there must be an element of control.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

It came after she was made the subject of a European Arrest Warrant, with the authorities in Madrid seeking her on charges of violent rebellion and misappropriation of public funds over her role in Catalonia\u0026rsquos controversial independence referendum in 2017.  A full extradition hearing lasting four weeks was set to get under way in Edinburgh at the end of this month.  However, on Thursday, a Spanish Supreme Court judge dropped the extradition request for the 61-year-old, an ex-Catalan education minister.  He also rescinded warrants for five other politicians who were wanted for their roles in promoting the Catalonia region\u0026rsquos independence, including former regional president Carles Puigdemont.  Responding to the decision, Prof Ponsati\u0026rsquos solicitor Aamer Anwar said: \u0026ldquoFrom the very beginning Clara Ponsati utterly refuted the charges she faced and Spain was accused of abusing the European Arrest Warrant for politically motivated prosecutions.  \u0026ldquoSo today\u0026rsquos withdrawal of all the European Arrest Warrants by the Spanish Supreme Court is\u0026nbspa tremendous victory for the Catalan politicians and people.

It emerged earlier this month that she faced the equivalent charge of treason in Scots law.  Her legal team warned she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she was sent back to Spain and convicted, sparking fears she could spend the rest of her life in jail.  Lawyers recently told a court they were looking at whether to call former Spanish government ministers to the witness box as part of the legal fight.  They were preparing to argue that the European Arrest Warrant was invalid, that the Spanish government could not comply with the relevant legal requirements, that the prosecution was essentially political in nature and that to return Prof Ponsati to Spain would be incompatible with her human rights.  On Thursday, Spanish judge Pablo Llarena withdrew the extradition requests after a German court ruled last week that Mr Puigdemont could not be sent back to Spain for rebellion, only for embezzlement connected to the alleged misuse of public funds for a referendum on secession.          If true, very good news that extradition proceedings have been dropped against @ClaraPonsati. Political differences should be pursued democratically not through criminal courts.

A University of St Andrews spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted for Clara, but will obviously monitor closely the further implications of the decision in Spain.  Mr Anwar added: \u0026ldquoClara would like me to thank the people of Scotland, the UK, her fellow Catalans and Europeans as well as the SNP, the Green Party, the STUC and Scottish Government for their tremendous support for her and the Catalan people.

At Islay Ales they produce a range of both cask and bottles conditioned beers. The bottled beers are real ale in a bottle. The beer is neither filtered nor pasteurised prior to being bottled and therefore continues to ferment and mature in the bottle. This process produces sediment in the bottom of the bottle.    They have recently started to make use of the fact that many individuals have bottled their own whisky on Islay and are looking for something special to do with the empty cask. They fill these casks with part of a brew and then allow the influences of the whisky and the wood to act on the beer by maturing it for at least six weeks up to almost three months, depending on the requirements of the customer.  This year Islay Ales were delighted to have been asked by WW100 Islay to produce an ale to commemorate the ending of the First World War and to remember those lives lost in the tragic sinking of two troops ships off Islay  Visitors are more than welcome to visit the Brewery, they are happy to show how the beers are brewed in the 4-barrel plant, which produces 1150 pints (640 litres) at a time. Depending on what day you come to the brewery you could see the brewing in action or it might be the casking, bottling or labelling, all of which takes place on site.  Before or after a tour of the brewery you can sample some of the available ales, sometimes Islay Ales might even have some on draught for you to try. You can also purchase bottles of the beers as well as Thistly Cross Cider. If you are looking for presents or something to remember them by, the Brewery shop has a range of clothing, glasses and other items.    The Brewery and shop is open from 10.30 to 5.00 Monday to Saturday during the summer but only to 4.00 in the winter. They generally do not open on Sundays unless a special request has been made.  A large number of establishments on Islay take the ales, either in bottle form or on draught so when you come to visit the island you are sure to be able to find Islay Ales near to where you are staying.  www.islayales  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Brander Lodge  Nestled within a scenic and tranquil location, The Brander Lodge offers comfortable and stylish facilities for those looking to relax and explore.

Across the UK, 50% preferred to remain. Those between 18 and 24 were more adamant remainers with three in four wanting to stay in the EU.  In the three way exit deal referendum idea forwarded by former Cabinet minister Justine Greening that would eliminate the least popular option of leaving with a deal in the first round.  After the second preferences of \u0027leave with deal\u0027 voters were allocated, the final result in Scotland handed remain a 66% share and leave with 34%.    The referendum idea was itself unpopular with UK voters, with only 36% in favour of the proposal and 47% against the idea.  The former education secretary argued the final Brexit decision should be given back to the people and out of the hands of \"deadlocked politicians\".  She called for three options to be on the ballot paper: the prime minister\u0027s Chequers deal, staying in the EU or a clean break from Europe with no deal.  The UK is due to leave in March 2019.  Downing Street rejected Justine Greening\u0027s call for a fresh referendum on the UK\u0027s exit from the EU, saying it will not happen \"in any circumstances\".  The poll also found that 60% of Scots thought in hindsight that it was wrong to leave the EU, compared to 46 per cent across the UK.  But 47% of those Scots polled did not think that once the Brexit negotiations were complete and the terms of Britain\u0027s exit have been agreed, that there should be another referendum to accept or reject them."},{"url":null,"title":"university-sacks-priest-who-held-service-for-the-gross-offence-of-pride-glasgow","story":"  Father Mark Morris, of Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church, in Glasgow, invited parishioners on Monday night to a rosary of reparation.  According to the church\u0027s website, the service in Glasgow was a \"Rosary of reparation for the gross offence to God which is Pride Glasgow.\"  Father Morris, who is the Catholic chaplain of Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU), held a service offering decades of the Rosary, Litany and Benediction in reparation for the LGBTQI+ event.  Saturday\u0027s Pride march was led by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called the event \"celebrating and reaffirming the values of tolerance, diversity, equality, love and respect.\"  But now Glasgow Caledonian University has issued a statement saying he won\u0027t return to his post for the new university term in September.  Principal Prof Pamela Gillies CBE FRSE said: \"Following due consultation, Father Mark Morris will not return to his chaplaincy role at the University in September.  \"The University will work with the Archdiocese of Glasgow to ensure the continued provision of chaplaincy support for staff and students at our Faith and Belief Centre when the new term starts.  \"The University is strongly inclusive and committed to supporting equality and diversity on campus.\"  Jordan Daly, Co-Founder of Time for Inclusive Education (TIE), which campaigns for inclusive education in schools, said it was \"sad and disappointing\" to see Father Morris\u0027s \"condemnation\" of the event.  He said: \"The Pride parade was, as always, a vibrant and colourful display of diversity, acceptance, and inclusivity.  \"The ethos of the parade is equality and love, so it is sad and disappointing to see that Father Morris has countered those fundamental values by holding this service and allowing a narrative of exclusion and condemnation to enter the mainstream as a result.\"  Father Morris celebrates Mass on Thursdays in the Faith and Belief Centre in the university\u0027s William Harley Building, and hears confession.  A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Glasgow said: \"This was a private parish devotion unrelated to Father Morris\u0027s role as chaplain.\"  NUS Scotland\u0027s LGBT+ Officer Kai O\u0027Doherty added: \"NUS Scotland is proud to be at the forefront of breaking down barriers facing LGBT+ people.  \"Universities should be a place where every student, regardless of religion, sexuality, or identity, feels accepted and supported to study without fear of discrimination.  \"Everybody within our university communities has a duty to ensure that campuses are compatible with the accepting and progressive culture that they strive to achieve.  \"We\u0027re proud of the progress that has been made, but every day we are reminded of how far we still have to go to achieve a truly inclusive society.\"  Following Ms Sturgeon\u0027s involvement in Pride, a Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is considered to be one of the most progressive countries in Europe regarding LGBTI equality, and Pride Glasgow is a fantastic event that brings communities together and celebrates all that LGBTI people contribute to Scottish life.  \"As a society we must champion equality and fairness at all times and defend the progress that has been made.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scots-tesla-investor-demands-action-from-elon-musk-for-calling-thailand-diver-pedo","story":"  Mr Musk\u0026rsquos posts on Twitter sparked backlash from shareholders and Silicon Valley analysts\u0026nbspwho called his behaviour immature and an impediment to the car company\u0026rsquos success.

Gamble, from Folkestone, Kent, was also said to have caused the comedian fear and alarm by tracking him down to the Glasgow gourmet coffee shop The Cup and Saucer and also while he visited the city\u0026rsquos Botanic Gardens.  Gamble, 48, was also alleged to have repeatedly approached Boyle and communicated with him while she is also said to have contacted him on social media during her alleged eight-month stalking campaign.  Court papers also stated Gamble repeatedly loitered at the places she knew 45-year-old Boyle would be present, and stare at him.  She was acquitted of the allegations when she appeared from custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last Monday but was ordered to be detained under the Mental Health Act for the next six months.  Gamble has spent the past six weeks being psychiatrically assessed at the Orchard Clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital and Sheriff Kenneth Maciver was told a six-month hospital compulsion order was the recommendation of the doctors.  She was also handed a three-year non-harassment order, meaning she cannot contact Boyle in any way either in person or by contacting him by phone, email or on social media.  Any breach of the three-year order could see Gamble end up with a custodial sentence.  All the unwarranted attention was alleged to have taken place between February 1 and September 22 last year.  The court papers stated the comedian\u0026rsquos full name of Francis Martin Boyle. The controversial funnyman has starred in the popular TV shows Mock The Week, Tramadol Nights and Frankie Boyle\u0026rsquos New World Order.  Gamble was alleged to have engaged in a course of conduct that caused him fear and alarm in that she did repeatedly approach him and communicate with him, stare at him, contact him on social media, repeatedly monitor his movements and activities, repeatedly attend at places she knew he would be present and repeatedly loiter in places she knew, or suspected, he would be present."},{"url":null,"title":"cliff-richard-verdict-analysis","story":"  \u0026ldquoTwenty-four years ago, American TV viewers watched in amazement as Los Angeles police trailed a white Ford carrying American football ledger OJ Simpson for 60 miles, the cavalcade itself followed by helicopters carrying TV crews. Simpson had just been charged with killing his ex-wife and her lover.  Twenty years later BBC viewers were treated to a similar show as police swooped on the home of Sir Cliff Richard as part of an investigation into historic child abuse, except the singer had not been arrested or charged with anything.  Now that Sir Cliff has won his case for a \u0026ldquoserious invasion of privacy against the BBC, the corporation is claiming that the ruling marks a significant shift against Press freedom and the public right to know.  They may well be right, but in the BBC\u0026rsquos haste to restore its reputation following the Jimmy Savile disgrace, they and South Yorkshire Police have been the architects of this situation.  What else were viewers likely to conclude seeing aerial pictures of the singer\u0026rsquos home other than \u0026ldquothere\u0026rsquos no smoke without fire, or \u0026ldquohe must have something to hide and all the other assumptions that would come with such a massive effort to cover the story?

It layers another privacy protection on top of existing safeguards and for the rich and powerful it could be an easy way to prevent any reporting of investigations, and not just sensational cases involving celebrities. Any media identification of people or companies alleged to have been involved with wrong-doing could now claim their privacy is being breached and it could kill investigative journalism stone dead.  The bar of a privacy breach is far lower than that of defamation, as proved in the Naomi Campbell case when she successfully sued the Mirror for breach of privacy in revealing her treatment for drug addiction despite making anti drug statements.

The new Dairy Milk bar will sit alongside the original on shelves and offer consumers greater choice, the company said.  Glenn Caton, Mondelez International president for Northern Europe, said the science behind the reformulation was a \u0026ldquotrade secret but said some of the sugar had been replaced with fibre to maintain the original bar\u0026rsquos structure and texture.  He described the taste of the new bar as \u0026ldquoincredibly similar to the original, saying: \u0026ldquoIt tastes very, very close to the original but a little less sweet. It\u0026rsquos been tested extensively on consumers and they love it.  Mondelez said a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers worked for almost two years at its Reading and Bournville units to cut sugar without adding any artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.  The calorie content remains similar between the two bars, but the sugar content has dropped from 56g per 100g in the original bar to 39g per 100g in the new version.  Mondelez said it would look to apply the approach to other Cadbury Dairy Milk products if it proves successful with consumers.  It also unveiled plans for the next two years to release its Cadbury Boost+ Protein bar with 32% less sugar, 30% lower sugar versions of its Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products and a line of its BelVita breakfast biscuits with 40% less sugar.  Longer term plans include a reformulation of Cadbury Brunch bars to cut sugar by around 20% and a lower sugar version of Oreo biscuits.  Mr Caton said the company recognised that consumers wanted to manage their sugar intake.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur brands have been around for hundreds of years. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people\u0026rsquos lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence.  \u0026ldquoTaking sugar out of our products isn\u0026rsquot easy and will take time.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 6:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 6:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Thursday 19 Jul 2018 6:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Thursday 19 Jul 2018 6:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770822.1531988489!/image/image.jpg","title":"business stream looking to make waves with sales and marketing director","story":"        Water supplier Business Stream has hired a sales and marketing director from a rival business.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4770715.1531940380!/image/image.jpg","title":"kevan christie judge politicians and officials by ability not bmi","story":"        The public shaming of NHS Scotland\u0026#8217s chief executive and our new Health Secretary \u0026#8211 who were told to quit their bad habits and \u0026#8220practice what they preach\u0026#8221 \u0026#8211 overstepped the mark in terms of intruding into people\u0026#8217s private lives.                No doubt, Tam Fry, chair of the National Obesity Forum, and Glasgow University nutritional expert Professor Mike Lean have enjoyed the 15 minutes of fame that their rudeness brought them.             These paragons of virtue effectively ‘called-out’ Health Secretary Jeane Freeman for allegedly smoking, having previously made an attempt to quit, while NHS Scotland’s chief executive Paul Gray was outed as a ‘fatty’ and told to lose weight.             It’s not my concern if Freeman smokes like a laboratory beagle – as long as she does something about NHS waiting times and delayed discharge. The same goes for Gray. He could go home at night and attach himself to a Toblerone drip for all I care. The important question here is – can he do the job? The calls from music hall double act Fry and Lean mark a worrying trend and do little to quell the sort of body fascism that leads to teenagers developing eating problems. READ MORE: Kevan Christie: Jeane Freeman makes good start as Health SecretaryI wouldn’t hesitate to criticise the Health Secretary on these pages or the chief executive of the NHS for that matter, but would never dream of making it personal by commenting on their habits or appearance. Their personal choices are their own to make.It fair to say both have risen to their posts through a combination of hard work and perseverance. The individuals in question are in key posts that bring a high degree of stress and it could be argued Freeman has the most difficult job in the Scottish Government.             Both are adults and, yes, both will know that smoking and obesity are killers. When they have time during the stressful lives they lead, they are probably trying to change bad habits – who isn’t? But to be subjected to this kind of personal attack, which came out of left field, is preposterous and stuck out like a sore thumb in the current climate of political correctness. Last December, a UK study estimated that one in four nurses are obese, and making a link between the long hours they work and their diet is easy to do. These dedicated health professionals probably eat on the go and are often too stressed and tired to rustle up a low-carb stir fry with extra quinoa. READ MORE: Scots NHS ‘staffing crisis’ as thousands of nurses quit            Fry is on record as saying that “it’s absolutely essential that people in the public eye practise what they preach”. I don’t agree. Granted it would be nice, but we’re in dangerous waters if people start getting employed based on their body mass index as opposed to their ability.In fact, someone like Gray is the ideal person to talk about obesity as he has ownership of the problem and first-hand experience of the difficulties some people face in trying to lose weight.We’re encroaching into similar territory as someone saying for instance, you can’t manage a Premiership football team unless you’ve played at the highest level – but Jose Mourinho has rubbished that kind of thinking. And does anyone seriously believe Freeman is a role model for people to emulate? She’s not Beyoncé.            So, while I agree with Fry and Lean’s central message on health. I feel on this occasion there was no need to shoot the messengers."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4758343.1531948209!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment health service without doctors is not worthy of the name","story":"        An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.                An array of different pressures have combined to create a crisis for the NHS in Scotland.            And one of the most significant is a growing shortage of doctors. According to the Royal College of General Practitioners Scotland, there will be 856 unfilled vacancies for GPs by 2021. And that means potentially life-threatening delays for patients trying to get an appointment and increased pressure on the GPs currently in the job.             Scotland is not alone with many countries around the world struggling to attract doctors, but that is no excuse. If anything, it demonstrates the need to find a lasting solution to the recruitment problem because competition for doctors will only get more intense.It is blindingly obvious that the best way to increase the number of doctors is to train more Scots to become doctors. However, new figures released by the Scottish Government show that the number of Scottish-domiciled students taking clinical medicine degrees at our universities fell to a ten-year low of 2,160 last year, compared to 2,350 in 2013/14.One reason for that is Scottish students face competition for places at medical schools from people from all over the world. Because medicine is a much more expensive course than other subjects to teach, the number of Scots allowed to enrol is controlled by the Scottish Government and international students are a lucrative source of external funds, effectively helping to subsidise the education of Scots.But this could prove to be a false economy. If the number of newly trained doctors fails to keep up with demand, then the recruitment crisis will only get worse. So the Scottish Government needs to take steps to persuade more school pupils that a career in medicine is for them – and they could start by addressing the causes of “GP burnout”, a problem described vividly by one doctor in The Scotsman recently.            But they also need to consider ways to persuade medical students from England, Wales and further afield that they should stay in Scotland after they graduate. During their student years, some may decide they like living in Scotland, but there are surely things that could be done to encourage the idea. Whatever strategy is adopted, Scotland needs to act quickly. It hardly needs saying but a health service without doctors is not worthy of the name."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771315.1532018780!/image/image.jpg","title":"watch theresa may slammed by tory mp when did brexit mean remain","story":"        Theresa May was blasted by one of her own MP\u0026#8217s during a highly charged session of Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions.

The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more seabirds entangled but fishing industry not always to blame says tour guide ","story":"\nDarron Smith cuts free a gannet.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone. Let’s hope not.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"scott calls on union to allow medical flights during aberdeen airport strike ","story":"Isles MSP Tavish Scott is calling on Unite to allow lifeline medical flights from the isles to continue through a proposed strike at Aberdeen Airport.\nMr Scott has appealed to Unite’s Scottish secretary, Pat Rafferty, after workers at the Airport voted for strike action in a dispute over pay.\nWorkers at Aberdeen Airport have announced their intention to strike at points throughout late July and August.\nAnd Mr Scott said this would deny NHS patients living in Orkney and Shetland the opportunity to attend scheduled medical appointments in Aberdeen through no fault of their own.\nMr Scott wrote:The strike action would affect not only leisure and business travellers, but also NHS patients travelling from Orkney and Shetland for treatment on the mainland. Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal

breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nThursday 19 Jul 2018 6:39 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27411  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe Occupied Territories Bill - proposed by Senator Frances Black - is expected to pass due to the support of Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, Independents and Labour. \nSinn Féin Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile welcomed the legislation, he said: “Goods and services that are only available because of gross human rights abuses and violations of international law should not be available in Ireland.\n\n\"On a daily basis, Palestinian villages are demolished and residents displaced to make way for the construction of more settlements,” he said.\n\"The international community considers the construction of Israeli settlements as illegal under International law and in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n\"An EU report in 2017 outlined that continued settlement building places a great strain on efforts to reach a lasting and just resolution in the region.\"\nSenator Ó Donnghaile described the existence of settlements as a war crime and said the Irish government must comply with diplomatic and economic sanctions against the state of Israel.\n“The Irish government cannot on the one hand condemn these illegal colonial settlements and on the other hand freely trade with them.\n“This is the time for action and to make history.

Michael McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted.
