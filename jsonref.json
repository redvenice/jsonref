Dogs were kept \u0027inside of a rotting caravan, with a filthy duvet for bedding\u0027 said Ms Wiltshire          Ms Wiltshire claimed bedding was thrown over droppings instead of it being cleaned          Cats were allegedly left to roam free or lived in sweltering caravans and even began \u0027panting\u0027          Because bigger dogs \u0027posed a danger to other animals they were each kept in decaying caravans with small outside runs\u0027          Cats and their litters were kept in cramped caravans with wooden partitions She added: \u0027They (sanctuary owners David and Julia Vaughan) will see my story as a betrayal. Perhaps it is - I feel like it is. But if I kept silence, it would be an even bigger betrayal of the many animals unable to speak up for themselves.\u0027Joanna added that Mr and Mrs Vaughan do care about the animals but said there is no way the couple are able to look after their 200 plus animals that includes ponies, sheep, goats, alpacas, pigs, dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs.Local resident Whitney Dawson visited the site last month and said: \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like it.\u0027          Cats were described as feral and left free to breed at their leisure on the rubbish-strewn site          Joanna said cats that were too young to be mothers gave birth to several litters, like Eeyore (pictured)           Conditions in one of the dogs caravans show a heavily littered ground and stagnant water           Eeyore (pictured) stands out as having had three litters in the space of a year          The former volunteer said rabbits were kept in tiny huts that were rarely cleanedThe 22-year-old added: \u0027It was horrendous. There was rubbish everywhere including broken bricks and mouldy food.\u0027The whole place stank and I had to dump my clothes after leaving one of the caravans because I was covered in fleas.\u0027Some of the dog bowls were full of black stagnant water and there were a lot of abandoned cages and fish tanks. It was just awful.\u0027          The sanctuary, run by David and Julia Vaughan, is moving to a new location after complaints from locals and activists          The yard was strewn in rubbish after the owners upped and left to start fresh at a new site          Residents described seeing dog bowls full of black stagnant water, flea-infested caravans and abandoned fish tanks at the site          It was home to 200 animals, including pigs, goats, chickens, ducks, cats, dogs and turkeys          Outdoor mess at the sanctuary which is moving location after fierce complaints from residentsMr Vaughan responded to those claims and denied any wrongdoing. He reported the site to police - because it was a target of break-ins by animal activists stealing cats.He said: \u0027I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. They have stolen four of our cats, ransacked the place and cut open a fence.\u0027We needed to leave the cats on the site until we had a suitable home for them at the new site. They have been fed and watered twice-a-day, every day.    \u0027We are doing our best overall. We are on our own and at this 12-14 hours a day.\u0027We\u0027re just here to give a home to animals nobody wants and we wish everyone would leave us alone to get on with our job.\u0027          Shocking pictures reveal squalid conditions at the sanctuary facing fierce criticism from localsJoanna said she had to pay for animal care out of her own pocket on several occasions. She added that she also took a kitten home to care for because its mother couldn\u0027t provide sufficient milk because of inadequate food.  The kitten died less than 24 hours later. Joanna also took videos and pictures of emaciated kittens and others panting with droopy eyes. Joanna described the heat in the caravans as \u0027stifling\u0027 and said she even had to buy a cool pad to offer the kittens some relief. She said: \u0027The cats also suffered with flies as the pens built for them were mostly inside the rotting caravans and were stifling. Cats and kittens were shut in the caravans and panting in the heat.          A petition started by Nicole Knight, says: \u0027Shut down Didcot Animal Sanctuary for good!\u0027          The owners of the site deny any wrongdoing and even claim some of their cats were stolen\u0027Ventilation was poor and there were so many flies that one day I discovered a food bowl literally alive with maggots. It wasn’t just one or two. It was a writhing mass that filled the entire bowl. \u0027The fly situation was not helped by the fact that the cats were not accustomed to litter trays and frequently went in corners of the pen. Sometimes the mess would be cleared up, but often it was dealt with by just throwing a blanket down to hide it.\u0027Joanna added that the RSPCA had made a visit to the site but is \u0027failing the animals\u0027.She said: \u0027In response to public opinion, the sanctuary are re-inventing themselves as a small-holding and are now refusing entry to all members of the public.           A rubbish strewn yard at Didcot Animal Sanctuary in Oxfordshire which has come under fire          David and Julia Vaughan and their mess were blasted in a 1,700 word Facebook post 18 months ago\u0027If action is not taken, this can only mean that things will become even worse as they will have no volunteers to assist them with the daily care of the animals. \u0027The RSPCA have failed these animals. They have inspected at least once and passed them despite seeing the deficiencies in care.\u0027     Mail Online contacted the RSPCA, who said: \u0027We are so grateful to people who report suspected animal suffering to us and we would like to reassure people we will always look into and, if necessary, investigate any complaints made to us about animal welfare.\u0027Unfortunately we are unable to discuss complaints about specific people and what action may have been taken.

We will no longer outsource to other countries. We build factories here in America and create jobs. We will provide jobs for all who are free from prisons as we abolish the 13th Amendment.

He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.               West sparked confusion during his appearance on Saturday Night Live when he wore a sweatshirt with the words \u0027FREE HOOVER\u0027 written across the front    The rapper said this week he had \u0027redesigned\u0027 the controversial hat and \u0027put positive energy into it\u0027. It is unclear why Kanye was wearing a Free Hoover shirt, but it appears to be related to Chicago gang leader Larry Hoover (right)    West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office.

Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told no) was great. He\u0027s leading the charge!\u0027 An hour later, Trump randomly declared his confidence in winning the \u0027Black Vote\u0027 - despite the fact he only claimed eight percent of the black vote in 2016.  \u0027So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote? And it will only get better!\u0027 he tweeted on Sunday. Trump then took aim at the FBI investigation into Christine Blasey Ford\u0027s sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, which he only launched after it was demanded by Sen Jeff Flake on Friday.  \u0027Wow!

He is currently serving six life sentences in Florence, Colorado. The sweatshirt is available for sale at $90 on Kanye\u0027s online store.     Donald Trump took aim at Saturday Night Live once again, after his embattled Supreme Court nominee was made the punching bag for the show\u0027s season premiere          An hour later, Trump seemed to feel confident that he would be able to garner the \u0027Black vote\u0027 It\u0027s not the first time West has shared controversial opinions about slavery. The rapper sparked outrage in May when he called slavery a \u0027choice\u0027 during an interview with TMZ. \u0027When you hear about slavery for 400 years — for 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were there for 400 years and it\u0027s all of y\u0027all. It\u0027s like we\u0027re mentally imprisoned.\u0027It wasn\u0027t until months later that West finally apologized for the outburst during a radio appearance in late August.West told WGCI he never \u0027approached or addressed the slavery comment fully\u0027 because \u0027it\u0027s not something for me to overly intellectualize\u0027.He then apologized for how his tone and how his actions, including wearing the MAGA hat on several occasions, have affected his fans.            West has spoken in support of Trump on several occasions since he was elected to the Oval Office. The pair are pictured at Trump Tower in December 2016\u0027I\u0027m sorry for the one-two of the MAGA hat into the slavery comment. And I\u0027m sorry for people who felt let down by that moment,\u0027 he said.Fans praised what appeared to be a heartfelt apology, but were in for another let down when West unveiled his redesigned version of the red cap bearing Trump\u0027s 2016 campaign earlier this week. He told Fader that he had added \u0027positive energy\u0027 to the hat by flattening the brim and changing its shape slightly.   Kanye has stunned fans by becoming one of the few celebrities - as well as one of the only prominent African Americans - to support Trump.He went to visit Trump in 2016 shortly after the rapper disappeared to seek mental health treatment.His wife, reality television star Kim Kardashian, has gone twice to see Trump at the White House.Kanye recently promised that a new album, called \u0027Yahndi,\u0027 would come out on Saturday but no work immediately appeared.    Watch exclusive videos of Kanye West¿s visit to The FADER | The FADERKanye West Says His Slavery Comment Abolishing 13th Amendment is Work in Progress | TMZ.com"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/14/50A97E0D00000578-0-image-a-22_1537968940322.jpg","title":"Naomi Campbell lectures staffers outside New York Stock Exchange","story":"    The Vogue cover star looked as stylish as ever in black slimline pants, towering heels and a fashionable white trench coat, with large shades shielding her eyes  Campbell was seen gesturing emphatically with two members of her staff as she sashayed out of the New York Stock Exchange after ringing the closing bell last Monday           Campbell had just rung the closing bell with rapper French Montana (pictured together) on behalf of Global Citizen, an organization that aims to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030The eyewitness continued: \u0027I couldn\u0027t hear exactly what she was saying but there were a lot of hand gestures and she was speaking in an authoritative, demanding tone.\u0027She had a very severe expression but she did soften and give the blonde woman a hug and a kiss on both cheeks.

And they are reasonably confident that they and their family can weather an economic shock—like illness or a spell of unemployment—without falling back into extreme poverty.\u0027The middle class are on track to reach 4 billion people worldwide by the end of 2020 – and 5.3 billion by 2030.The majority of people newly entering the middle class live in Asia, with nearly nine in 10 of the next billion middle-class consumers living in that part of the world, spread between China, India, South and South East Asia.The middle class in Asia has largely grown due to the increase in productivity and improved manufacturing technologies at major multinational companies in those countries, Kharas said.          The middle class are on track to reach 5.3 billion people by 2030, according to an analysis by the Brookings InstituteMany businesses in Asian countries have also narrowed their focus on what they produce and sell in order to bring their strongest products to market and become an effective part of what experts call the \u0027global value chain.\u0027For example, in the Philippines, instead of producing a whole car (as in the past), companies there now produce just the electronic hardware and upholstery for vehicles – a change that has made them more profitable to the benefit of their workers and middle class overall. In addition, Asia hasn’t had a currency crisis since 1997 – in which foreign investors and domestic residents took their currency out of national markets, causing currency values to plunge and leading to inflation.\u0027Those kinds of things generate big setbacks for the middle class,\u0027 Kharas said. \u0027In Asia, for the past 20 years there hasn\u0027t been those kinds of setbacks, which has contributed to the growth of the middle class.\u0027 While global development efforts focus on elevating the world\u0027s poorest, just one person is lifted out of extreme poverty every second, while five people enter the middle class every second, according to Brookings.This is important because the middle class is the engine that drives demand in the global economy – and governments listen when the middle class makes demands.In addition, private households account for roughly half of the global economic demand and two-thirds of that comes from the middle class. By comparison, the rich spend more per person but make up such a small proportion of the population that they can\u0027t move the economic needle the way the teeming middle class can.Ultimately, a growing middle class means a stronger global economy and a larger population to be targeted by businesses around the world. "},{"url":null,"title":"May faces Cabinet calls rebrand Chequers plan Brexit","story":"    Theresa May (pictured at conference yesterday) has been struggling to thrash out a deal with the EUTheresa May is facing Cabinet calls to \u0027rebrand\u0027 her Chequers plan amid fears that Tory activists have been won over by condemnation from Eurosceptics.The PM has been warned there is a \u0027lot of work to do\u0027 to convince the party\u0027s rank-and-file that the blueprint is good for the country.A Cabinet Brexiteer told MailOnline that even though the proposals were \u0027pragmatic\u0027 the government\u0027s message was at risk of being drowned out by furious attacks from Boris Johnson and others.The stark warning came as Mrs May struggles to keep her Chequers plan alive despite coming under heavy fire from her own MPs, Labour and the EU.The conference in Birmingham has been dominated by the mounting civil war between Tory factions - with Chancellor Philip Hammond openly lambasting Mr Johnson\u0027s rival ideas for future ties with the EU as a \u0027fantasy\u0027.The former foreign secretary is due to launch another salvo against the premier at a rally on the fringe of the conference later. Mrs May - who says her Chequers plan is the only way to keep smooth trade and avoid a hard Irish border - is facing a crucial test of her support when she delivers her keynote speech to the party faithful tomorrow.However, despite signs of leadership jostling, allies are increasingly confident the party will give her more time to try and thrash out a deal with the EU. They have been encouraged by applause for criticism of Mr Johnson in the conference hall.

But visa applicants will be required to meet minimum salary thresholds before taking a job.There will be ‘temporary’ exemptions for areas of the economy dependent on low-skilled migrants but businesses will be told to train up British workers.Mr Javid said his reforms would result in unskilled immigration from Europe becoming ‘much lower than it is today’.  Sajid Javid and Theresa May, pictured  at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, pledged that far fewer low skilled workers would be let in from Europe after Brexit  Cabinet Ministers Michael Gove (pictured left) and Jeremy Hunt (pictured right) were both out jogging today ahead of Tory Party conference. Today\u0027s events in the main hall  - including Sajid Javid\u0027s major speech on immigration - are set to be overshadowed by Boris Johnson\u0027s big speech on the fringesHe questioned the benefit of large-scale unskilled immigration, saying: ‘It must have some kind of negative impact on wages growth in the UK.’But the Home Secretary insisted Britain would remain ‘a positive, outward-looking nation open to the best talent from across the world’.He added: ‘The immigration system should be very focused on high-skilled people that we might need and dramatically curb low-skilled people coming to our country. And at the same time look across the world.‘If we are talking about a software engineer or a surgeon, to me it doesn’t matter about the nationality of that inidual, it’s not really important. We want the talent and skill that they are going to bring so it shouldn’t matter if that high-skilled person is coming from India, Australia or France. What matters is the skill that they are going to bring to the UK.’          The Home Secretary, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, said  that the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next electionHe said the target to slash net immigration to the ‘tens of thousands’ might not last beyond the next election.Mr Javid, a Eurosceptic who backed Remain, also waded into the debate over Brexit, hinting that he could switch to backing a Canada-style trade deal if the EU rejected Mrs May’s Chequers plan at this month’s Brussels summit.He batted away questions about his own leadership ambitions but, in a significant move, he defended Mr Johnson, who has come under fire for his outspoken attacks on Chequers. Mr Javid said the former foreign secretary was ‘a massive asset in campaigning’."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/26/13/50AB4A1500000578-0-image-m-22_1537965959816.jpg","title":"Free climber scales Yosemites scariest peak without safety gear","story":"    Alex Honnold in action. The 33-year-old American is world’s most famous ‘free solo’ climberThe man who climbed 3,000ft up the sheer face of Yosemite’s...Share this articleDressed in a red T-shirt, tatty grey hiking trousers and wearing a pair of special climbing shoes, all he had with him was a small bag of chalk to prevent his fingers slipping. A single error would, needless to say, have resulted in tumbling to a certain death.The record-breaking 3 hour 56 minute ascent, much of which relied on tiny cracks and hand-holds the thickness of your average HB pencil, has been chronicled in often spine-chilling detail in a National Geographic documentary called Free Solo.Thanks in part to its breathtaking footage of his progress up the climbing world’s most famous and photogenic rock face, the film has gained huge acclaim in the U.S., where it was released last week.Several critics have described it not only as ‘the greatest climbing movie ever made’ but also (with a nudge and a wink) as ‘gripping’.Yet for all Honnold’s derring-do, a hefty portion of the drama being played out that day was unfolding several miles from the picturesque valley where he was dangling by gnarled fingertips.At its centre was his girlfriend Sanni McCandless, who’d driven tearfully away from Yosemite at daybreak, fearing not only that her presence might prove to be a fatal distraction, but also that she might never again see the man she loved.    Alex Honnold,Sanni McCandless \u0027Free Solo\u0027 documentary premiere, Toronto International Film FestivalOn the day itself, June 3, Honnold rolls out of bed at 5 am, eats a bowl of muesli and sets off. In the first hour, he zooms past eight other climbers on El Capitan, all of whom are sleeping on hammocks pinned to the rock-face.Eventually, he finds himself entirely alone. The principal challenge is a section of El Capitan roughly 1,800 feet off the valley floor and known as the Boulder Problem.It consists of a vertical wall that can only be scaled using a handful of tiny holes and ripples in the rock that are several metres apart.‘There are about ten moves on it, and the holds are small and far apart,’ Honnold has said. ‘Only one of them is something you can pull down on.‘When everything’s facing sideways, if your foot slips or if anything happens, you’re shooting off the rock face — no matter how hard you’re holding on.‘It’s what makes the Boulder Problem so tough.’The section culminates in a highly-dangerous ‘karate kick’ manoeuvre during which a climber must launch their entire body across the cliff-face from one hold to another. Should they fail to execute it properly, a fall will almost always ensue.‘The crux of the crux involves this crazy karate kick into this corner, which requires a high degree of flexibility and precision, because you’re kicking at mid-chest height way out to the side, and once your foot’s over there you have to bring your hand over,’ Honnold has explained. ‘It’s just an outrageous sequence.’So concerned was Honnold at his ability to execute the move that he spent one day practising Boulder Section (with ropes) no fewer than 12 times. In the event, he managed it seamlessly.That sets the stage for a traditional Hollywood ending to the documentary. His first act, upon scampering to the summit, is to borrow a mobile telephone, call Sanni and tell her: ‘I love you.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"Innocent children Syria going home land never seen","story":"    Hundreds of Syrians leave the Lebanese-Syrian border town of Arsal in Lebanon to make the journey across the mountains and return home to war-ravaged SyriaBut as many spoke of their relief to be heading back to their bombed-out villages, other families were torn apart as some relatives had not got approval to go back.Sobbing, Nouha Bo Ali Haj, 14, said she was returning from a camp on the outskirts of Arsal with her father – but not her mother, who is waiting for approval.Asked why she was crying, she said: \u0027I am going to miss my mother.\u0027Iran fires missiles with \u0027Death to America, Israel and Al...London mother, 26, who took her one-year-old daughter to...Share this articleRimi Bo Ali, 50, said: \u0027I registered but my name has not come back.\u0027She said her family had been forced to leave their home in the town of Fleta, just across the border, in 2014 and added: \u0027We are living in a camp – it is better for us to live in a house.

Now Pierre Huyghe is entering consciousness itself – with the help of AI and 50,000 bluebottles‘I was looking for something that could write itself, that could self-generate, evolve or mutate,” says Pierre Huyghe. Impeccably grizzled and sparkly eyed, the French artist sits vaping discreetly in dappled sunshine beaming through the upper windows of the Serpentine Gallery in London. Downstairs, Huyghe’s new exhibition is being installed. After our interview I’ll try for a glance through the gallery door. The show is not available for sneak peeks. I’ll try again, unsuccessfully, a week later. It’s not that they won’t let me in, the polite, dust-covered curator explains, it’s that they can’t. Not yet.I’m not surprised: Huyghe is exacting. Autonomous, changing, self-regulatory systems such as colonies of bees, iding cancer cells, flu virus, ants’ nests and groups of creatures cohabiting in an aquarium are this artist’s preferred raw materials. They tend to make his work tricky to install.While he also makes film and sculpture, over the last decade Huyghe has become known for reimagining the artwork as ecosystem. He deposits groups of objects – some evidently alive, others not so – into an environment, then retires and allows nature to take its course.Last summer I made a pilgrimage to his acclaimed ecosystem After ALife Ahead. An eight-hour journey from London ended in a rain-soaked trudge through the German city of Münster, to city margins where the urban fabric dissolves into a lacework of petrol stations, fast-food joints and leisure centres. Tucked behind a drive-through Burger King, Huyghe had excavated the concrete floor of a derelict ice rink and replaced portions of the ceiling with robotic hatches that opened and shut to the work’s mysterious inner rhythms.Climbing down into the vast pit revealed an alien landscape, pocked and uneven: packed clay towers housed colonies of bees algae grew in pools. On a platform in the middle was an aquarium housing a genetically modified GloFish and a venomous Conus textile sea snail. HeLa cancer cells ided, unseen, in an incubator. At the start of the work there had been chimera peacocks, too: piebald birds with two sets of DNA.An earlier environment, Untilled, included a lanky white dog called Human with one leg painted bubblegum pink and a concrete cast of a reclining nude, with a large bees’ nest that grew over her head like a parasitic mask. Installed between compost heaps in a park in Kassel, Germany, the bees pollinated psychotropic, medicinal and aphrodisiacal plants – nightshade, jimson weed, rye, cannabis. Frogs croaked, ants hatched, Human acquired the ennui befitting an art-world celebrity, and the cycle of life rolled on.Human, alas, will not make an appearance in Huyghe’s new work at the Serpentine. The star turn here is not animal, but artificial intelligence (AI), the processing of which we witness via five LED screens as it attempts to analyse events within the human brain.In January, Huyghe learned of a laboratory in Kyoto in which scientists were working on deep image reconstruction to decode complex visual information from human brain activity: artificial intelligence that can go some way toward working out what it is you’re looking at or visualising. This machine telepathy uses data harvested during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures brain activity. After analysing this brain activity, the AI sorts through vast nets of example images already in its system looking for fragments of a match to help it determine what image the human subject was holding in their mind’s eye.Huyghe worked with a man to whom he gave a set of interlinked images to visualise, some based on physical images, others that he invited him to imagine. The man pictured them one by one as his brain activity was monitored. What we see on the screens in the gallery is the AI moving through its exemplar images, sifting for echoes: we are looking not at the final result of the image reconstruction but a visible manifestation of the process of machine learning. Huyghe won’t disclose what the original images were: it’s up to us to decipher in turn what they might have been, and how they may be linked to one another.“Of course as a visual artist it is very appealing – a new medium,” says Huyghe. With machine learning he has generated an “ecosystem” of a different kind, passing “from a world that is constructed – with all the complexity and contingencies that go with it to evolve without me – to a world that can be imagined”.Rather than manipulating a physical environment, he is now, as he puts it, “gardening” in someone’s mind. The work asserts its autonomy first in the perceptual gap between Huyghe and his human subject – if I tell you to think of an apple, the apple you think of will not be the apple I think of – and then in the analysis and image construction undertaken by the AI.While “very impressive”, Huyghe warns that deep image reconstruction “is far from something close to a reality or image that we know”. What we see on the Serpentine’s screens at any one time is “a chimera made out of thousands of past images and the present images that are just there for a fraction of a second”. Huyghe shows me a couple of clips on his phone. They’re like something out of deep space or even deeper nightmare: a fleshy, suggestive sump, seething with traces of near recognisable detail.AI does not process images as a human brain might: there’s no associative logic to what might emerge. Near-human intelligence that reveals itself to be subtly non-human is freaky. Huyghe and I discuss the idea of the “uncanny valley” – the zone occupied by entities that are nearly but not quite recognisably human. As humans we tend to find them particularly alarming. (Monster-makers for horror movies understand this perfectly it’s why the most disturbing monsters tend to have attributes that recall Homo sapiens.)Huyghe says the term “uncanny valley” came from “a Japanese guy who was trying to make a kind of android”. “When you do 3D realism, you arrive at a threshold. That threshold is the moment where you’re trying to reach realism but there’s this tiny, tiny something that says it is not, and that’s where the uncanny valley is. It puts you in a very excited mode, because there’s something you start to have empathy with, and of course a part of you says you should not.”Even without a 3D android as persuasive as the one in Alex Garland’s film Ex Machina, Huyghe’s AI will invite intellectual empathy. Pattern recognition isn’t only the preserve of machine learning: we humans do it, too, and we’ll find it hard to resist interpreting the images as they evolve on the LED screens. However, just by standing in the gallery looking at them, we, as components in the Serpentine gallery ecosystem, will have an impact on the overall environment.Then there are the flies. Along with the behaviour, movements and density of human visitors, a set of sensors installed in the gallery will also monitor the behaviour patterns of 50,000 bluebottles introduced into the space.Though 50,000 sounds akin to the fourth plague, the intended effect, curator Rebecca Lewin tells me, is something closer to an “irritating August infestation”. The flies will be fed sugar up in the rotunda, where they are expected to congregate. Unable to breed without the presence of protein, their stock will need replenishing over the course of the exhibition. Purchasing flies in bulk has been one of Lewin’s more unusual curatorial challenges. Human visitors and bluebottles alike will trigger sensors in the gallery, feeding into a “neural network” that will change the pace at which the images on the screens evolve.Huyghe presents himself as an instigator, rather than author. That stance is in keeping with an ego-denting suggestion buried in the work – if deep image reconstruction can generate images from brain activity, it suggests that this brain activity and the images it generates are common to all of us: that something about our imagination is generic. In the field of visual art, that idea is humbling and not a little awkward. What if the mind is not what sets us apart from other people, asks Huyghe.Each of the complex, self-generating ecosystems Huyghe has constructed over the last decade reflects an existing set of real-world relationships. After ALife Ahead repackaged the struggle between the built human environment and the living world couched just beneath its crust.

Now, pedestrian walkways are being reimagined for a 21st-century cityOn Pudding Lane in the City of London, the fateful alleyway where the Great Fire began in 1666, an unprepossessing staircase leads off the cobbled street. There doesn’t seem to be much reason to climb the steps, tucked away behind a row of granite columns at the base of a dumpy office block, but inquisitive walkers will be rewarded. Those who follow the stairs find themselves led along a walkway, shuttled across a bridge above a busy dual carriageway, channelled through a gloomy undercroft, finally emerging on to a deserted piazza raised above the Thames, with one of the most unexpected prospects in London: a wide-open river view. The Shard stands straight ahead, Tower Bridge rises to the east and the new tower of the South Bank sparkles to the west.This forgotten terrace, miraculously left uncolonised by a riverside dining concept, is a fragment of a larger vision that would have seen the entire City area threaded with a network of elevated walkways, punctuated by such squares in the sky. The “pedway” was an ambitious postwar plan to whisk pedestrians up from the car-choked streets of London and give them a utopia of streamlined paths and bridges, providing safe and efficient passage between the financial hubs of the Square Mile.The network was intended to stretch for 30 miles, from Fleet Street to the Tower of London, and from Liverpool Street to the Thames, but only a fraction was built, much of which has since been demolished. A few fragments remain, from plaintive bridge abutments still waiting for their connection to arrive, to winding staircases that lead to dead-end landings, scattered across the City like curious portals to a secret dimension.Just when the last remains appeared to be facing extinction, these floating walkways are showing signs of a revival. The London Wall Place project includes a new network of flying decks and serpentine walkways that thread their way around ancient chunks of the Roman city wall. Together with 21 Moorfields – the shopping mall at the new Crossrail station at Moorgate – they herald the beginning of an elevated journey where you will be able to go from Moorgate to the Museum of London without touching the ground.The parallel pedestrian universe was first hinted at by architects William Holford and Charles Holden, who drew up a plan for rebuilding London’s financial centre in 1947, after it had been devastated by bombing during the second world war. “There is, of course, even a functional pattern in the ant-heap,” they wrote, describing the jumbled network of alleyways and spaces that defined the medieval street network of the City. “The planner’s problem is to make this pattern more efficient.” Their plan contained a bold chapter on pedestrian ways that were to be “as fit for the traffic it carries as any of the main streets”, an idea that would inform the redevelopment of the City for the next three decades.The urge to separate pedestrians from traffic was nothing new: the construction of Holborn Viaduct, Rosebery Avenue and Clerkenwell Road in the 19th century were all attempts to sweep people up above the noise and grime down below. But the rapid growth of car ownership in the 1950s and 60s spawned increasing anxiety around congestion and collision, leading to the widely accepted belief that people and cars should be segregated for the benefit of both. The influential book Traffic in Towns, published by planner Colin Buchanan in 1964, set the mould for the hostile apparatus of flyovers, gyratories and ring roads that would proliferate across British cities for the rest of the 20th century.“It was because traffic engineers were in charge,” says Peter Rees, chief planner of the City of London from 1985 to 2014, now a professor at University College London, explaining the origins of the pedway. “It wasn’t driven by some great feeling of compassion towards pedestrians it was simply about getting people out of the way in order to speed up traffic flow.” With the new dual carriageways of London Wall and Lower Thames Street slicing right through the centre of the capital, pedestrians were lifted up on bridges so they wouldn’t slow down the cars.The doctrine of vertical separation informed the reconstruction plans for the major bomb sites of the Barbican and Paternoster Square, both designed with towers emerging from podiums, threaded with pedestrian walkways. The former remains a thrilling (if labyrinthine) brutalist Babylon of bush-hammered concrete bridges over bodies of water, christened with names such as Speed Highwalk. The latter was a bleak, barren expanse of elevated paving between dreary office blocks and, thankfully, no longer exists.Apart from these projects, the rest of the pedway plan was developed almost by stealth. An obscure City of London Corporation document published in 1965, mysteriously known as Drawing 3400B, mentioned the pedway by name for the first time and, within a couple of years, the provision of dedicated pedestrian walkways had become cemented in policy as a condition for securing planning consent.In a revealing documentary, Elevating London, Michael Hebbert, professor of planning at UCL, sheds light on the haphazard nature of the pedway’s evolution. “It was never really conceived as a system,” he says. “They didn’t even have a drawing of the network as a whole. It had to be constructed from the separate planning consents for inidual office blocks.” It was a British version of a postwar planning strategy that would eschew a top-down vision for an incremental network that would be negotiated on an ad hoc, site-by-site basis – and thus almost doomed to fail from the beginning.The piecemeal plan was to be lubricated by incentives. Developers were offered plot ratio concessions, allowing them to squeeze more rentable office area out of their sites, and permitted to use their pedway-connection platforms for temporary offices, giving them extra revenue while they waited to be joined to their neighbour – connections that would usually never arrive. Walking the streets of the City today, you can still make out chunks of unconsummated pedway at first-floor level that have remained glazed in ever since. Other sections have been spruced up: at Suffolk Lane, just east of Cannon Street station, a pedway ramp begins inside a grand neoclassical colonnade before emerging on to a bridge, recently clad in smart timber slats. A forlorn concrete bridge over Wormwood Street, meanwhile, has just been adorned with a traditional Korean house, impaled at an angle as if fallen from the skies, by artist Do Ho Suh. Redundant for their original purpose, these aerial fingers are becoming armatures for other inventive happenings.Beyond the lack of a joined-up masterplan, there were plenty of other obstacles to the pedway’s progression. Development didn’t proceed quite as quickly as had been imagined, while the fire brigade struggled to find equipment suitable for the walkways and the police were unsure of their legal powers on these new-fangled floating arteries. All the while, bills for maintenance, cleaning and lighting soared. But the main problem was that people didn’t use them. As Rees explains: “In as far as people carry mental maps to get around, those maps are based on streets. The minute you displace that map by taking people up on to walkways, their mental map function breaks down and they get lost.”The effort of going up a flight of stairs only to come down another also proved less attractive to many than the prospect of gingerly picking their way along the kerb of a dual carriageway. The growing conservation movement put up a strong fight, too. Looking at the 1963 map, it is not hard to see why, given that sections of pedways appear to slice right through St Paul’s Cathedral.With the Big Bang of the 1980s, which brought about deregulation, banks started to acquire larger sites to accommodate their dealing floors, making it harder to thread pedestrians through the buildings at first-floor level. A belated attempt to lure people up to the existing walkways with pubs, shops and kiosks came too late. Architect Terry Farrell’s Alban Gate, a gargantuan postmodern palace that straddled London Wall and was completed in 1992, was one of the few projects of the era that embraced the pedway, welcoming people with a theatrical drawbridge entrance, but few others followed suit, leaving the Barbican and Museum of London sites as quaint anomalies.So it comes as a surprise to walk along London Wall today and find a rusted orange steel bridge flung above the carriageway. This is London Wall Place, one of the most agile projects to emerge from Make Architects, which has reimagined the pedway as a more playful and generous version of the original, with decks wide enough to incorporate benches on which you might want to sit awhile, beside green walls and reflecting pools.It will soon be joined a little way to the north by Wilkinson Eyre’s 21 Moorfields project, the commercial bounty of Moorgate station’s Crossrail redevelopment, a 564,000 sq ft glass and steel behemoth that will be connected to the Barbican at first-floor level by a modern interpretation of the highwalk, welcoming you in to the inevitable podium of retail and dining opportunities. Like London Wall Place, it will be a hulking beast, but, as you are led through the sequence of walkways in a suspended realm between street and slab, you probably won’t even notice.The elevated network will end at the Museum of London site, where the new £250m Centre for Music is planned. The concert hall’s design is appropriately in the hands of Diller Scofidio + Renfro, architects of New York’s High Line, who have a penchant for aerial drama.The ultimate City-wide plan will never be realised, but, more than 50 years from its conception, these segments of pedway are being reincarnated in a more imaginative form than ever.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89c9ef71fc008f8344e82494b9a315b086831495/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0eb0452319568bcfd44fbdad1d61ece","title":"theresa may speech party conference brexit","story":"Who would be her? At the Conservative party conference her party of lemmings strain at the leash to plunge over a Brexit precipice. She has little to lose by confronting them head on – and saving her country while she can. Here’s the speech Theresa May could make on Wednesday:“There are times when prime ministers are called upon to make monumental decisions – on war and peace or on the economic future of our children and grandchildren. When the country faces a grave peril it falls to a leader to meet it without fear or favour to particular factions, ignoring threats to their personal survival. I am well used to this now.Stepping into No 10, I took on a country in a state of shock a country so bitterly riven it seemed as if it might be beyond holding together. But I have tried my utmost. Now we have reached a political deadlock: within this party, in parliament and with EU negotiators.It can be lonely when there is a clamour from all sides urging wildly different courses of action. This has gone beyond orthodox politics. Only a forensic examination of risks and opportunities can guide me now. You know I am not driven to hold on to this job at all costs. My intent is to take us through this so we emerge with the most hope and the least harm done. I will not go on and on – but I will go on until Brexit is fully resolved. That’s my duty.Our history proves us the natural party of government, in power except when we grow complacent. Through our own folly, we now risk relinquishing power again. When Jeremy Corbyn claims to embody the new common sense, we should be laughing out loud.One strand of our party has led us astray. A kind of mania has distorted our pragmatic traditions, holding Brexit to be a miracle cure for every problem and only satisfied with an extreme form of departure from the EU.“Preposterous” and “deranged” are not the kind of words I use. But your Canada model means long checks at every border, not just in Ireland. It will be the despair of industry. It will grievously damage the interests of farmers and manufacturers. Let us know when you invent your unicorn technology to wave all traffic through.I tried to accommodate all sides. Perhaps I tried the impossible. Now it’s time to break the deadlock with a compromise that will be no one’s first choice, but which is gaining support. Call it everyone’s plan B, because it avoids everyone’s worst fears. Brexit must happen, but without harm. We will seek to stay in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the European Free Trade Association, asking for associate status, such as that once enjoyed by Finland. We will stay close to the single market, in the customs union, as Jersey is. Call it the Jersey plan. But we stay free of the EU common agriculture and fisheries policies.EEA free-movement rules give us greater control over our borders. There would be no free movement of citizens, only free movement of workers: only those with a job can move here. This will address the concern that EU citizens come here to beg or to be a burden. Migrants with jobs bring prosperity.This EEA associate status would be temporary, a fixed three-year transition for negotiations. Our sovereign parliament always has power to change it. Our European neighbours will welcome frictionless borders for free-flowing trade, and no threat to the unity of the United Kingdom or of a hard border within the island of Ireland. Make no mistake, this is Brexit. No one knows which Brexit people voted for, but I do know most people want this done and dusted.Offered this compromise deal, I trust enough of my MPs’ common sense to assert itself: to concentrate their minds, they should just glance over at the opposition. I believe MPs across the House will rally to this EEA associate option, regardless of their leaders’ positions. Every MP carries the same responsibility as I do for seeing the country through this.But if MPs reject a deal, then the only option is to put this to the people and rely on their good sense.”Could she? Would she? From all we know of her, Theresa May has no such agility or political imagination. History will record her as the worst of prime ministers if she drags the country down to a bad Brexit. But there is just time for her to rescue her legacy – and us – with a historic act of bravery.

This month, she followed in the footsteps of thousands of other talented, fed-up teachers and moved abroad – in her case, to St George’s British International School in Rome.“It wasn’t a difficult decision. My job in England took over my life. Over the past year, I had stopped laughing and smiling. I had lost all sense of who I am.”Despite being director of learning, literacy lead and director of English at her previous school, Odell, 38, had to teach 20 out of 30 lessons and mentor three new staff. “I had to get up at 4.30am to get everything done, returning home at 7pm and working for another hour before bed, as well as at weekends.” She offered to take a pay cut to reduce her teaching load, but was refused.In Italy, she has been allocated the same amount of teaching but none of the responsibilities – and she will teach a class of 16 children, instead of 34. “If St George’s will have me for ever, I will never return to teaching in England,” she says.As the new school year gets under way, an Education Policy Institute report has highlighted how the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers to stem the flow of experienced staff leaving the profession has led to a “severe shortage” in England’s schools.“There’s a toxic mix of factors, created by this government, that is making teachers decide they cannot teach in England in particular any more,” says Mary Bousted, general secretary of the National Education Union. “The low net pay of teachers means many cannot even afford rent. There is systemic overworking, with teachers routinely working 55 hours a week, and a vicious accountability system, which means teachers are not given the time and support to get better at what they do.” It reflects badly on the government, she says, that so many highly qualified teachers are going abroad. “It’s not that they don’t want to teach, it’s that they don’t want to teach in the context we’ve created in this country, and the government is responsible for that. We are haemorrhaging teachers, particularly at secondary school level.”Teaching timetables in the UK are similar to the OECD average. “But our teachers spend twice as long as other teachers in high-performing OECD countries preparing lessons, assessing and looking at data. It is that, combined with low pay, which is driving teachers away. The very measures the government has taken to police standards are decimating the numbers of teachers in the classroom and lowering educational standards.”Meanwhile, four in five British international school teachers say they are happy or very happy with their new jobs, according to the Cobis survey. “Other countries exercise much more trust in their teachers,” says Bousted. “They enable their teachers to concentrate on what’s important.”Over the next 10 years, it is expected that international schools will require up to 230,000 more teachers to meet staffing needs – 145,000 of them will be recruited from the UK, ISC Research predicts. If so, according to Schools Week, international schools could snap up more than half of all the UK’s trainee teachers over the next 10 years to meet their targets.According to Nick Gibb, the schools minister, more than 14,000 teachers returned to teaching last year, many of whom had been working abroad. “A period teaching in another country has always been an option which adds to a teacher’s experience,” he said.In Italy, Odell enjoys lower living costs and free lunches, so expects to be better off despite a lower salary. “I feel optimistic that I’ll develop as a teacher here while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.”She says: “We had very limited resources. If you have a child with significant behaviour challenges because of childhood trauma, you need access to a clinical psychologist. For example, there was a child we worked with tirelessly to keep in school, to keep him safe. He absolutely needed specialist support but children’s mental health services said they were taking only life-threatening cases.”The child was later excluded from junior school. “Despite government spouting off about the importance of early intervention, it wasn’t there. Due to this lack of resources, the needs of very young children at my school were not being met.”The job left her with high blood pressure and, like her colleagues, she suffered chronic stress and insomnia. “I feel like I’ve done my bit and I was not prepared to compromise my personal health.”With 23 years’ experience as a teacher, 12 as a head, she found it easy to get a job abroad, choosing Jeddah because the teaching profession seemed highly valued there. Now her earnings are tax-free, her transport to work is paid for, and she has a complementary two-bedroom flat. “It’s the equivalent of getting a six-figure salary in the UK.” She is not sure she will work in Britain again.Jenny Anderton (not her real name), 51, who taught at state primary schools in southern England for more than 10 years, says that in the UK she was “more of a social worker than a teacher”. She is now teaching in Seville. “I love teaching, but it was frustrating at my UK school – there was a lot of paperwork and meetings for the sake of meetings,” she says.The last straw came when a child who had severe emotional issues was excluded. “I had flagged up that he needed help. He was a child in crisis.” Instead of supporting him, the school involved the police when he bit another teacher. Anderton’s wages are £500 less a year but she is confident she will be better off because of the lower cost of living. “I’m looking forward to being appreciated, rather than having the whip cracked over me all the time, and enjoying my job again, rather than being comatose at the end of every half term. The focus in the UK on attainment, when social services is on the brink, is bonkers and exhausting. I’m not planning to ever go back.”“Teaching in the UK is a thankless task,” says Victoria Mitchell, 39, who has taught at state primary schools in Nottingham for 11 years. She took a job at an English language school in Puglia, Italy, this month. “In the UK we’re set unrealistic targets and, compared to when I started, there’s little support. Things just get swept under the carpet.”She left a previous school after she discovered a leader from the academy chain lurking in the corridor, monitoring her teaching through a window. “I felt I was constantly being watched.”Her GP advised her to get a new job and, along with 11 other experienced teachers at that school, she did. But her new school was equally stressful. “Everybody was still under immense pressure. I love teaching PE, music and art and am passionate about languages. But in the UK, the focus is entirely on maths and English.”After holidaying in Puglia, she decided to send her CV to all the language schools there and received three job offers. “I chose the one that seemed the best fit for me.”On her last day of the UK summer term a parent yelled in her face. “I drove home from my final ever day in a primary school in this country in tears.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edadf29b9629799f47bfd59410d3263c5c2449cc/0_234_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a12539d8744ffee02978f99b1604f237","title":"10 steps to starting your own creative business","story":"If you like the idea of launching a startup, but you’re not sure where to begin, here are some top tips to get you going – from hooking the market to cooking up investmentFancy unleashing your inner entrepreneur and setting up your own business? For those with a creative streak, this can be a daunting proposition. You may see yourself as an artist, designer or maker rather than a business manager. But many creative businesses are thriving in the modern economy – such as in fashion and interiors, digital development and graphic design, advertising and marketing – and creative entrepreneurs are flourishing.If you can combine your creative ability with an entrepreneurial mindset, you could make a healthy living from your talent while retaining a high degree of independence. But competition in the creative industries is massive and fear of failure looms large for many people. So how on earth do you go about making a success of a new venture? Here are the key questions to ask yourself and issues to consider as you ponder starting out on your own.1. What problem are you solving?Business advisers say that every business idea should solve somebody’s problem. This may come as a surprise if, for instance, you are setting up a cake business. But since cakes are on sale everywhere, why are yours any different? They may solve the problem for people seeking lower calorie cakes or low-cost party cakes, for instance. Entrepreneurs can succeed by offering novel solutions to old problems.2. Test your productWhatever your business idea, it is essential to test that it has a strong appeal and a discernible market. This is the all-important market research stage, where you find out who your potential customers are and how they feel about your product. Only by market testing can you hone the product into something successful. You should be prepared to radically change the idea in response to trials before any wider-scale plans.3. Identify your customersDefining your market is a key element of market research. If you’re selling dog baskets then your target market is dog owners. The next stage is finding ways to locate and connect with them. Social media offers effective lifestyle targeting and is relatively cost effective.4. Research your competitorsBecome an expert on your competitors, find out their strengths and weaknesses and look for areas where you can outcompete them.5. Come up with a business modelThe business model is the method and means you use to run the business. Are you selling from a physical shop or via e-commerce? Do you take payment in advance or by subscription? Innovative business models help entrepreneurs thrive in existing industries that are already heavily catered for, as Spotify has in music (through its subscription model) and Uber has in travel (with taxis ordered and paid for via an app). Don’t be put off by having a product that is already widely available, just try and think of a new and interesting angle to market it.7. Raise financeThe boom in entrepreneurial businesses in recent years has been fuelled by angel investors and venture capitalists. These are talent spotters with the funds to back new ventures they believe in. Banks also lend funds to small businesses, though in the current climate they are highly risk averse. Any serious backer will demand to see a well worked out business plan. This needs to detail market research and present a strong argument about why the product or service will succeed. It needs an informed estimate of the funding needed and a prediction of future sales. Watch The BBC’s Dragons’ Den to see how easily such plans can be pulled apart under rigorous scrutiny. That said, don’t be put off by rejection. Persistence can pay off. And you could always try crowdfunding through Kickstarter, Indiegogo or Crowdfunder.8. Big bang, slow burn or delayed launch?If you have a new and exciting offer, a big bang launch can be a great opportunity for maximising publicity and gives a date to work towards. But many creative businesses will build up gradually as they gather a head of steam. It could be worth creating a launch further down the line when you have some business experience to boast about.9. Cashflow! Cashflow! Cashflow!Getting paid for your services in a timely fashion is vital to the long-term survival of the business. This may be out of the entrepreneur’s hands, but it is important to understand payment cycles in the industry and factor payments into sales projections.10. Can you bootstrap?Bootstrapping – as in pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps – means running your own business, at least initially, without external funding, and ploughing the income from your activities back into the business. For many creatives, this could be quite feasible, if they sell their services on a freelance basis anyway. Once your business idea takes off, the bootstraps can be untied as you start attracting interest and funding from venture capitalists. Fundamental to the successful businesses of the future will be the way in which they adapt harnessing the power of creative thinking and innovation.Falmouth University’s business school offers courses where creativity meets commerce, and ideas and entrepreneurship are given space to grow. Combining industry experience and academic study, students are given the chance to establish their own start-ups, initiatives or services as part of their degree. They work in a collaborative, supportive environment, benefitting from the university’s industry connections and the first-hand business experience of tutors. With a history of more than 100 years of creative education, Falmouth University is now a hub of innovative digital activity, and continues to encourage cross-disciplinary work among staff and students."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/605f6abc67d8c06ca41698e4a2614809df15ced5/123_356_4749_2850/master/4749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=255a097156c644549b3c81c0260ef55a","title":"saint laurents dreams of the orient when you know a culture you cant make mistakes","story":"As a new exhibition charting Yves Saint Laurent’s fascination with the far east opens in Paris, Susie Lau tackles the line it treads between appreciation and appropriation In the autumn of 1977, off the back of a succession of lavish collections inspired by the Ballets Russes and Spanish matadors, Yves Saint Laurent delivered his critically acclaimed “Les Chinoises” collection. It was inspired by China, a country he had never visited at that point and it coincided with the launch of the house’s iconic Opium perfume. This is the starting point for Yves Saint Laurent: Dreams of the Orient, a small but comprehensive exhibition that has just opened at the Musée Yves Saint Laurent in Paris.Covering this seminal Chinese collection, as well as a collation of examples that show Asia – or more specifically China, India and Japan – as an ongoing source of inspiration for the French couturier, it begins with the theme of Imperial China. We’re immersed into a sumptuous display of pieces from the Chinese collection that sit alongside Asian artefacts to emphasise the fact that Saint Laurent was a true connoisseur of the cultures that he was paying tribute to, explains curator of the exhibit Aurélie Samuel.“He knew the culture, the history, the objects – sometimes it’s the motif or the design that inspired him, sometimes it’s the shape. For example, he knew the difference between a Han and Manchu garment.” This is evident in details such as the brocade of a fur-trimmed gold jacket mimicking the exact pattern of a Han dynasty jade vase or the shape of a blue and white Ming vase echoing in a 1983 embroidered qipao dress.Upstairs in the India section of the exhibition, Samuel is keen to emphasise the subversive nature of Saint Laurent’s method of extrapolating from cultures. For example, by dressing women in Mughal prince robes and turbans adorned with a sarpech jewel that were traditionally the attire of powerful men, Saint Laurent was re-contextualising traditional dress and thus empowering women. “He wanted to assimilate Asian symbolism to reveal to a European audience,” says Samuel.“I approached every country through dreams,” Saint Laurent once said and it’s this attitude of yesteryear’s haute couture world that feels somewhat fraught in today’s social-media-fuelled dialogue, where the risk of problematic cultural appropriation is only a Diet Prada call-out Instagram post away. Faithfully replicate a garment belonging to a culture not your own and you’re wrongly appropriating, but interpret that culture liberally, as Saint Laurent once did, and you could be accused of inauthenticity.When it comes to the borrowing of chinoiserie motifs or Japanese kimonos in fashion, Saint Laurent of course is not alone, as evidenced in the 2015 blockbuster China: Through the Looking Glass exhibition which was centred on western designers and their interpretation of Chinese aesthetics. The result is that Qing dynasty dragon robes, mandarin collars, qipao dresses as seen on Maggie Cheung in In the Mood for Love and blue and white Ming vase patterns make up the mainstream lexicon of what people recognise as “Chinese” fashion. But Samuel argues that what Saint Laurent did was far from appropriation. “He didn’t want to copy China. He wanted to find the spirit of the culture and it’s a legacy and a tribute to these cultures.”Certainly there’s no denying the sheer beauty of Saint Laurent’s pieces within the exhibition, as well as the faithful retelling of his inspiration source material, but walk past a bank of illustrations for YSL’s Opium perfume, launched in 1977, with every figure donning an Asian conical hat once known as a “coolie” hat and you would have to put it down to the context in which Saint Laurent was working.In recent years, designers have wisened up to the intricacies of cultural appropriation and have largely steered clear of overt or obvious means of “exoticising” of Asian cultures. This is especially as China, Japan and India are no longer mythical far-away entities, but economic powers that are yielding native designers who are forging a new identity in Asian-authored fashion. So, what would a modern audience make of Saint Laurent’s Chinese collection if it was shown today?“I think they would see that he understood the culture,” says Samuel. “Saint Laurent was cultivated and instructed – when you know a culture, you can’t make mistakes. If you only have an aesthetic approach, you can make mistakes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac4956ee86cb1a1c4af734ab0cc7a261b180d9a8/0_5_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f63e559ffb499ed64835122025b07b54","title":"mandy nicolas cage the most maverick actor since marlon brando","story":"The actor has been derided, imitated and made into innumerable memes. But even his worst performance has got more life to it than Ryan Gosling’s latestNicolas Cage: most fearless actor of his generation or scenery-chewing joke? The debate rages on rage being the operative word. Cage recently expressed frustration at being the object of viral internet mirth, specifically “Cage rage” memes, usually featuring the actor at his most wild-eyed in a still from 1989’s Vampire’s Kiss (the one where he turns even a recitation of the alphabet into a maelstrom of thespian exuberance).In the 30 years hence, Cage has pushed at the frontiers of acting acceptability, even if that has meant opening himself up to ridicule: the YouTube supercuts of “Nicolas Cage losing his shit” and memes such as My Hair, for example. His latest movie, Mandy, won’t help. It features Cage suffering harrowing loss, undergoing torture, ingesting hallucinogens and going on the rampage against a biker death-cult. Mandy is a doom-metal symphony of stylised excess that only Cage could pull off. In 2013, Cage obsessive Ethan Hawke called him “the only actor since Marlon Brando that’s actually done anything new with the art of acting”, saying Cage had “taken us away from an obsession with naturalism”. His legions of fans (there is a dedicated Reddit thread that calls Cage the “One True God”) would agree.For comparison, there is a textbook example of “naturalistic” acting out the same week as Mandy: First Man, in which Ryan Gosling portrays Neil Armstrong as a glum, repressed type. Armstrong’s vacuum-sealed personality, First Man suggests, is part of what made him the perfect astronaut, but it has to throw in a lot of retro space action to keep things interesting. Perhaps “naturalistic” acting lends itself to modern blockbusters where the special effects take centre stage? Put Cage in a movie and he is the special effect. One of Mandy’s most memorable scenes is an unbroken take of Cage in his bathroom, in his pants, drinking half a bottle of vodka and morphing from grief-stricken victim into howling, chainsaw-wielding psycho avenger. That’s your next meme right there.Cage has likened his style to James Cagney’s in White Heat: “Was that realistic? Hell, no. Was it exciting? Hell, yeah.” To me, he’s one of a dwindling club of movie wild men whose members might include Nick Nolte, Jack Nicholson, Christopher Walken, possibly Joaquin Phoenix. Or, going back further, Brando, Dennis Hopper or Klaus Kinski. Did Werner Herzog ever make a decent fictional movie without Kinski in it? I can only think of one: Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, where the lead was … Nicolas Cage.These are actors who can never convincingly play “normal”, and the movies would be a duller place without them (and without over-the-top freakouts such as Mandy). You could say they’ve gone beyond the frontiers but, unlike Gosling’s Neil Armstrong, they remembered to bring something back.Mandy is in cinemas on 12 October and on DVD, 30 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445c337b532313bdcc72c67331e291db88109b3c/0_0_8049_4828/master/8049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a55ccc31f050ff22e2d2eb9ff559c534","title":"harry meghan wedding chef michelin stars clare smyth","story":"Core restaurant by Clare Smyth wins double accolade in guide for Great Britain and IrelandClare Smyth, who catered for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s evening wedding reception, has been awarded two stars for her first solo venture, Core, in the 2019 Michelin guide for Great Britain and Ireland.The accolade for the restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, which opened in July 2017, is the latest achievement for Antrim-born Smyth, who, in July this year, was named the world’s best female chef and last year won the Michelin Guide’s inaugural award for best female chef.Smyth, a protege of Gordon Ramsay, was greeted on stage at the BFI Imax in central London with a kiss from her former boss. She told the audience of 400 people, including 180 chefs: “It makes it obviously even more special that Gordon’s handing it to me … It’s been a hell of a year. We’ve achieved what we really set out to achieve.”The lack of women at the top was highlighted by the fact that only one other restaurant with a female head chef – Sabot, in Mayfair, central London, where Nieves Barragán is in charge – was awarded any new stars in the 2019 guide.Smyth told the : “It’s nice to be out there and doing it for female chefs. We just need to encourage more women to come into the industry and if I can help inspire other people to do that, I think it makes our whole industry better.”Commenting on the fact that only one other female head chef was honoured at the ceremony, she said: “It’s probably a reflection of the number of women in the industry. We need more women to come into the industry.”Ramsay said: “She’s tremendous – she’s the Margaret Thatcher of cooking. She knows what she wants and she comes from a good stable. To get two stars straight away – there are chefs who have been cooking for 30 years and haven’t got two stars – is a testament to her capabilities.”Smyth, who catered for 200 people at the royal wedding evening reception on 19 May, was made an MBE in 2013 for services to the hospitality industry. She served “posh burgers” and pork belly with candy floss for guests including Sir Elton John, the Beckhams, George and Amal Clooney, and Serena Williams.Smyth left her family’s farm between Ballymena and Belfast when she was 16 to study catering at Highbury college in Portsmouth. She then worked at Sir Terence Conran’s Michelin House restaurant, the French Laundry in California and Per Se in New York, before becoming chef patron at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in 2007.At Restaurant Gordon Ramsay she became the first and only female chef to run a British restaurant with three Michelin stars – one of only seven women globally to have held the coveted rating. The Michelin inspectors said they were “bowled over by the depth of flavour … all of your cooking delivers”.Two other restaurants were newly awarded two stars, though unlike Core, both Moor Hall in Aughton, west Lancashire, and Kitchen Table at Bubbledogs in Fitzrovia, central London, previously had one star.In all, 21 restaurants were newly awarded one star and three were newly awarded two stars, which is believed to be a record. There were no restaurants joining the four in the UK, and 100 or so globally, that have three stars.Reflecting a growing trend, a number of pubs – or former pubs – were awarded one star, including the Chestnut in west Cork, one of three places in the Irish city to get a star, and the White Swan just outside Burnley in Lancashire.Brat also won a star, having opened in a former strip club in Shoreditch, east London, where it offers Basque-style cooking over an open fire.There was also a star for Salt in Stratford-on-Avon, which was launched after a kickstarter campaign. The head chef, Paul Foster, said: “I took a risk, left my job, told my wife – she wasn’t very happy … we got a hundred grand, we put everything into the restaurant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69e0e685f1d0243c62c401582ee209700b2d09b6/0_1478_4912_2946/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ba741fa42b64b82a7542e0696df559","title":"nigel slater chicken fontina cakes recipe","story":"A ball of chicken and bacon with melted cheese in the middle – what better way to make a quick supper?Put 350g of minced raw chicken in a mixing bowl.

Mayorga also revealed the protracted legal process by which she subsequently agreed to settle the claims. It was an agreement which, her lawyers claim, was never honoured by Ronaldo and contains documents that prove he knew she had not consented.Ronaldo has vehemently denied all the allegations.Mayorga said in an interview with Der Spiegel magazine that she had chosen to go public in the wake of the #MeToo revelations. By breaking her end of the agreement, she may now face the possibility of having to pay back $375,000 awarded to her eight years ago, on top of legal fees, in an out-of-court settlement reported by Der Spiegel.The alleged assault occurred in the summer that Ronaldo left Manchester United for Real Madrid to become the then most expensive player in the world. He went on to enjoy unparalleled success in Spain, forging a reputation as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He captained Portugal to victory in the European Championships of 2016 and this summer completed a £90m transfer to Juventus in Italy.In the interview, Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo met her in a nightclub, Rain, where she was working and invited her back to his hotel room. He then forced her to have anal sex with him after she had rebuffed a series of advances.“Basically he ... he begged me to touch his penis for 30 seconds,” she said. “I was laughing at him because I thought, ‘Is this a joke? This guy that is so famous and so hot ... he’s a frickin’ loser and a creep.’”Mayorga said she agreed to kiss Ronaldo on the understanding he would then leave her alone, but that instead he increased his assertiveness and began groping her, before finally forcing her into sex. She claimed she said no several times, but he ignored her.“After he assaulted me, he wouldn’t let me leave again. He wouldn’t let me leave”, Mayorga told Der Spiegel.Mayorga allegedly filed a complaint with Las Vegas police the next day. But she refused to name her assailant. She says she was then in shock for three months before ultimately determining to draw a line under the matter by agreeing to a settlement.The many documents that comprised this agreement included questions asked of Ronaldo by his own lawyers. According to Der Spiegel, an earlier version of the questionnaire he was asked to fill out allegedly includes an admission from Ronaldo that “she said no and stop several times”. It is not known whether such an admission was included in the final version of the questionnaire.As part of the settlement, Mayorga allegedly wrote a letter to Ronaldo that his lawyers were obliged to make sure he had read within a fortnight of the agreement. It is asserted by Mayorga’s lawyers, Der Spiegel reports, that this commitment was never fulfilled.According to Der Spiegel, the money that was paid to Mayorga as part of the settlement came from a bank account in the tax haven of British Virgin Islands, registered to a company that had held Ronaldo’s earnings from advertising and sponsorship.Ronaldo categorically denies all the allegations and says that sex between the pair was consensual.Ronaldo’s lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the Spiegel report “is manifestly illegal and violates the personal rights of our client Cristiano Ronaldo in an extremely serious way” and is “one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d39ac1455945bda0cf4f9d8e972e9936384fa068/0_425_2281_1368/master/2281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c28a1f84ed1e96a324ea5d2a65e1ac","title":"from party girl to belgian top flight emma coolen","story":"Less than five years after deciding she wanted to make it at the top, the Dutch player has risen from tier eight to realise her dreamTwenty-year-old Emma Coolen cared little about the game. She knew nothing about the teams. But she was there, in Stockholm, on 14 November 2013 to watch the Danish side Fortuna Hjørring’s visit to Tyresö FF in the women’s Champions League, to impress another girl.“She was a huge fan of Christen Press, who was playing in Sweden at the time with Tyresö FF,” Coolen says. “I had no idea what she was talking about but I thought: ‘OK, I’ll go there, get Christen Press’s autograph and she’ll love me forever.’ That was the plan.”Did it work? “No!” But the flirting tactic changed her life. A day after she watched Marta, Press, Ali Krieger, Caroline Seger and others playing, the Dutchwoman – who was playing casually in the eighth tier in the Netherlands – decided she wanted to make it to the top, in five years.“It was surreal, it’s really cliched but I was sitting in the stands and all these people were cheering for female footballers?” Coolen says. “I was just really impressed. They weren’t your stereotypical girls, they were fierce strong women and incredible athletes and I immediately thought: ‘I want to be like this.’ So that’s where it started. I vividly remember thinking the words: ‘What have I been doing with my life up until now? This is what I should have been doing.’”Four years, nine months and 25 days later, she pulled on the shirt of KSK Heist and came on at half-time to make her debut in the professional Belgian Super League.When she began her journey it required quite a lifestyle change. “I was about as bad as they come as a teenager,” says Coolen. “At that time I was very rebellious in school I was skipping classes and was known as the party girl, basically because I was insecure and trying to fit in.”She was playing football but not seriously – it was an excuse to hang out with a group of girls and drink on Sundays. “I never believed that I actually could make it to the top level. Which sounds kind of weird because on the internet I’ve always been very confident and vocal about reaching my goal.“When I started I was playing in the lowest league, I was smoking, drinking. But I just tried to focus on the next step ahead of me which always seemed do-able. It was a strategy that worked for me.”A week after her trip to Stockholm she decided she needed to switch clubs and approached a player she knew at FC Eindhoven: “I knew they had three or four women’s teams and were playing at all levels of football. I thought that would be perfect and I could hopefully work my way up from their fourth team to their first team.”Coolen stayed at Eindhoven for two years but found it difficult. “I was mainly there with their second team,” says the 25-year-old, who has blogged about her journey since 2015. “I was doing a lot of training on my own, a lot of work on technical stuff, but the gap between the second team and the first team was too big for me at that point. I travelled to games with the first team, posted cool pictures of the bus, but I never really played with them and that was tough.”She decided to move on and in Belgium, with VC Moldavo, she rediscovered the joy of playing, partly because the style was more suited to her skill set.“I was suddenly improving so quickly and that’s when it really started being fun for me again,” she says. “In Holland the main focus is on a player’s technical ability, but that is just one approach and for me it was always going to be my biggest weakness because I hadn’t had any technical training until I was 20.“In Belgium there’s a lot more focus on the tactical and physical ability of players it’s why I feel so good playing in Belgium. In Holland I’ll always be the worst player on the team technically, which is not a lot of fun.”However, her rapid development stalled when injury struck and she got stuck in a mental rut. So, when KSK Heist contacted her about joining them in the Belgium Super League this summer, she was surprised. “I had a hamstring injury that I didn’t really take care of because I wanted to play so badly. I spent the last year and a half being constantly injured. I was struggling to take a step back. I ran into the wall. It was physically and mentally a tough year.“Usually when you transfer up a level it’s because you’ve had a brilliant season and I had just had the worst possible year. I didn’t really know what to imagine. I signed completely blank, having not met the girls or seen them play. But it’s been everything I’ve ever wanted from playing at the highest level. It’s the life of a pro player.”It has not been easy for Heist – after three games they have three defeats and have conceded 23 goals – but that has built a dogged unity: “We went into the season with 16 incoming transfers and everyone knowing we’re the underdogs. For some reason that creates a strong bond in the team.”When Coolen knew she might appear in Heist’s first game of the season – a 9-1 defeat at Gent – what it meant did not sink in straight away but then “four days before the game I lay awake in the middle of the night and it hit me that my journey from the lowest to highest level would be complete”.• England’s under-19s began their European Championship qualifying campaign with a 9-0 defeat of Malta, including a hat-trick from Tottenham’s Jessica Naz and a clean sheet for Manchester United’s Emily Ramsey.

There are plenty of maps, blogs and guided tours cropping up online (more about that below).So what is urban hiking? Well, it’s exactly what it says on the tin: taking on a challenging walk – perhaps at pace – in city and town settings, often with a view to racking up some considerable elevation. Much like a bracing country hike in the Peaks, Alps or Highlands, climbs and descents (either via hills or staircases) are something to be enjoyed and attacked, rather than endured.The appeal of urban hiking is obvious. It’s a great way for city folk to get more exercise without any fancy equipment, it’s a sport that enables locals to discover more about the history and background of where they live and it’s a handy way for older people to get active and to socialise. Best of all? It’s pretty much cost-free.Many of us love to ramble on a weekend away, so it’s odd that when we return to our urban lives we forget how to use our legs, hopping on the bus or tube rather than stretching our limbs. Urban hiking reverses this trend and makes sport of tackling lanes, mews and markets along the way. It can be educational too – lots of guides and maps encourage urban hikers to take in local landmarks and buildings, with notes describing their connections to the history of the area.There are plenty of ways to get involved, too. People living in towns and larger cities can simply look up walking tours aimed at tourists and join these organised treks and hikes. After all, they’re not just designed for the enjoyment of people who are new to the area. Be warned though, if you want to cover a considerable distance you’d be better off striking out alone. Urban walking tours aimed at visitors are often more focused on cramming lots of sites into shorter strolls and focusing on a particular theme or period in history, rather than packing in the miles (or hills).To take to the streets without assistance, you need a bit of preparation. But not much. Armed with a smartphone with a map app and a destination punched in, you should be fine. While a bit of pre-hike research will put you in better stead, you can easily find pre-made routes and loops online to suit your desired distance (and your appetite for hills). The website of walking charity Ramblers has plenty of maps and resources for newcomers and, once you’ve signed up for its free membership, you can get stuck into the in-depth routes and guides. You can also plot your own routes on websites such as Mapometer, which allow you to easily create maps to follow and share.One of the benefits of urban hiking is how little gear you need beyond the basics (and a bit of common sense). It’s sensible to take a small bag with essentials such as water, a sugary snack, such as an energy bar or flapjack, and a light rain jacket. If your phone’s battery is poor, it’s worth packing a back-up or charger, just in case.But beyond that, try not to weigh yourself down – you’re likely to never be too far from a shop, cafe or pub, so cut yourself loose from lugging too much garb. Oh, but don’t forget a box of plasters to treat any sore feet.Thankfully there aren’t any strict rules to adhere to when urban hiking (beyond those you’d normally comply with as a pedestrian), however, one tip is to not use the same road twice along a route. Or to put it another way, you should always aim to cover new ground and not double-back on your previous, outward passage.Other than that, you’re set. What are you waiting for?

More and more people are realising that easy-going, thoughtful exercise can have surprising benefitsThis year, the Harper’s Bazaar list of “best new fitness trends and classes to try for 2018” included an incongruous addition. At No 7, wedged between hula-hoop body-toning sessions and trampoline fitness classes, was “walking” – plain, old-fashioned walking, that anyone can do for free. It seemed an odd choice of “new” activity to highlight in a list of fitness trends.The idea that walking is suddenly fashionable appears, at first, to be at odds with everything we’re told about where fitness is going – and the pace at which people want to be doing it. A worldwide survey of fitness trends shows that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is the most popular fitness trend in the west this year. In the UK, spinning is most popular, according to an industry report from UKActive and DataHub. Of course, the idea of fast, intense, time-efficient exercise that delivers insta-results fits in with how we see ourselves: as people whose lives are the busiest in world history. “I went for a walk” lacks the heroic ring of: “I just killed myself doing 50 burpees.” However, a deeper look at how people are exercising or, more importantly, want to be exercising, shows a different trend: a move away from the quick fix, back to slower (although not necessarily less difficult), more measured forms of fitness. “Conscious” is the word I kept coming across while researching this article: “conscious motion”, “conscious flow”, “conscious control”. Imagine the opposite of hurling your, perhaps uncoordinated body around a fitness class at high speed: that’s conscious movement. The idea is that, if you’re “conscious”, you’re doing whatever it is that you’re doing to your body with precision and a full awareness of the physical mechanisms at work – yin yoga is conscious, rugby is not.More importantly, it’s also about being self-aware enough to see the big picture, diagnosing your physical, spiritual and emotional needs. As you step back from your once-a-week spinning class you might become aware, for example, that you’re still a stressed, underslept commuter with a bad shoulder, dull skin, uneven muscle tone, a spine that has morphed itself into the exact shape of your office chair, an iffy diet and a soulless box-set habit. Having ascertained these things, consciously, you would then go about, best-case scenario, reconfiguring your lifestyle accordingly.The elite trainer David Higgins delivers bad news, however, for anyone who is hoping consciousness might mean not having to do any exercise at all. “The gym,” he says “is not a substitute for lack of activity during the week. It’s not, ‘OK, I’ve been sitting on my arse or lying on my back for 23 hours of the day and then I’m going to go to the gym for an hour.” Higgins was the first person I heard use the term “conscious movement”. “I don’t think most people have heard of it. I think it’s a new thing even though it’s been around for ever. I think, finally, people are realising that they don’t have to necessarily kill themselves to get major, meaningful results.”The way we’re living is not anatomically sustainable, he says. We should be integrating conscious movement into every area of our lives: lateral lunges in front of the TV rolling on our backs like children to loosen up our spines, to give two examples.“If you can find something that maybe takes you into your body a little bit more, then I’m all for it, rather than trying to escape from the stresses of life. Kind of internalise things a little bit and say, ‘How do I feel? What is my body saying to me right now?’”He says that HIIT is a quick fix whose practitioners often don’t have adequate control over their bodies to execute it safely. “That’s not where I’m coming from. I’m interested in longevity, postural control and a pain-free lifestyle. We are all going to have to look a bit more inwards if we are going to survive and live a happier, healthier, more pain-free life.”Those already doing conscious movement may be part of a wider step-change. A look at the sorts of classes on offer in Britain’s rapidly expanding independent exercise sector, for example, indicates a move towards less hyper forms of exercise. MoveGB gives its 300,000 users access to more than 6,000 physical activity providers across Britain. Its CEO, Alister Rollins, says that yoga, pilates and mind-body classes are “by far the most popular activity, with yoga at least twice as popular as a genre than any other single genre available on MoveGB” (the other three genres are gym and swimming fitness classes outdoor activities and climbing). “Mindful exercise such as yoga and pilates are growing in popularity as the market becomes more educated to holistic wellbeing, whereas HIIT once was on the top of everyone’s list for fast-hitting results,” he says. “Consumers are becoming more in tune with their bodies and the impact that mindful exercise can have psychologically.” He points to an increase in “niche yoga classes – for example, yoga for climbers and yoga for cyclists”. Yoga that is, in Higgins’s words, mitigating against any damage you might do yourself in other sports.Beyond yoga and pilates, what else counts as conscious movement? LIIT – low-impact interval training – is a good example. And a good example of LIIT is the government’s nine-week Couch to 5K initiative, where your three runs a week begin with a five-minute walk, followed by 15 minutes of walking and running split into one- and one-and-a-half-minute intervals. LISS – low-impact steady state – is another form of exercise where you’re using conscious control, whether swimming, running, jogging. And high-intensity fitness workouts have created their own niche in mindful exercise: “active recovery”, a short, low-intensity workout that aims to increase blood flow, metabolism and joint movement, has become a popular class for adrenaline junkies on their days off – or for people who have injured themselves in class.Niki Rein is the founding CEO of Barrecore, a dance-inspired workout that has expanded from one studio to 12 in a decade. Barrecore “integrates the fat-burning format of interval training, to exhaust each major muscle group, with static stretches which lengthen your muscles and offer relief”.How would Rein describe conscious movement? “When you’re not counting on momentum to execute the movement. If you imagine doing a slow bicep curl – you’re feeling the muscle on the front of your arm as you raise your hand up towards your shoulder and you’re feeling it on the back of your arm as you’re extending the arm straight. That would be a conscious movement. If you’re doing something at speed, you’re not necessarily working the entirety of the muscle and injury is more likely to happen over time. We try to work every single muscle in the body in a conscious way and you can really feel those imbalances. So, when you start seeing results, you understand why.”Rein thinks the current fascination with high-intensity exercise is linked, firstly, to the false assumption that exercising faster gets better results and, secondly, to the bragging rights that come with saying: “I’m busy.” “People feel guilty if they don’t say they’re busy. For a long time I set a bad example to my staff by not doing any self-care. There’s a lot of value placed on being busy and I think it’s a scapegoat for not keeping fit, for not eating right, not getting a pedicure, having dinner with friends. The term ‘self-care’ is growing and is helping that issue.” For those wanting the hit of a strong workout with the benefit of self-care, she recommends a mixed class such as yin-yang yoga: “Strength yoga followed by flow and yin so you don’t feel guilty for not getting in what you think you need, but you’re also getting what you probably need the most.”Walking, explains Harper’s Bazaar, somewhat awkwardly, is “often not even considered a sport and when it is only for those around retirement age”. But however unintentionally, the magazine has hit on possibly the biggest driver of conscious movement – a desire for healthy longevity. “I’m 35,” says Higgins, “and I’m looking at the long-term approach unlike the 20-year-old trainer who’s had zero stress in their life and can’t understand why you can’t get to the gym every day. I want to be a grandad one day and live as long as possible, obviously. If you get injured, you get ill, you suffer from pain – then what the hell is the point?” David Higgins’s book The Hollywood Body Plan will be published by Headline on 27 December, priced £25.

These screenings are for babies under one: the difference between Harry Potter and Fifty Shades of Grey is really marginal, or, if you prefer, totally nonexistent, to anyone so young. You would have to be either childless or amnesiac not to know that toddlers are in a completely different category. “Restraint on a parent’s lap” – or what a layperson might call “cuddling” – is unlikely to cause emotional or physical harm. This bullshit – a way of framing the maternal world so that the mother is always policed, and is relevant only in the degree to which she serves or fails her baby – makes my blood boil.But, at 11am on Monday morning, on their way in to see Skate Kitchen (certificate 15) at the Brixton Ritzy, the new mothers of south London are extremely zen. Jenny Banks is with her three-month- old baby, Arthur, her second son: “First time around you’re a bit more vulnerable to whatever the trending article is on Facebook. You care less what people think, the second time. And you’ve succumbed to the reality of not being a perfect parent.” She is meeting Charlotte Saini, whose three-month-old baby Jemima is her first: they come to the cinema regularly, and “it’s all been adult films. Some of them have been a bit crap, but never because they were a PG. It is interesting, if people think content is affecting the babies.” There is something gracious in the way she says “interesting”, when her tone conveys something more like “silly”.Gemma Browne is at baby cinema for the first time, with five-week-old Lara, who is fast asleep. “I want to do something that makes me feel like a normal, human adult,” she says. “People run ridiculous things – workshops in French singing for babies from age nought. Rock’n’roll classes. She doesn’t even know that her hands are attached to her body. But there are loads of things that are for adults. Last week I went to mother-and-baby standup, comedians do their normal routines, but the audience is all sober and it’s the middle of the day.” She recalls one woman arriving and not realising it was a baby standup. The comedian shouted: “Where’s your fucking baby?” Of the many things new babies have over toddlers, says Jenny, one is that “they don’t have very strong opinions so long as they’re with you, and they can’t move”. Plus, of course, you’re allowed to swear in front of them (though whether or not Bath council would give you a licence to is another question). “There’s this strong message around self-care at the moment,” Gemma continues. “I’m not getting a lot of sleep so I’m already a bit of a zombie. I think everyone’s realised that you need to be sane as a mum.” Esther Malloy’s baby, Eric, meanwhile, is 13 weeks old. “It’s early days. I’m still, now, learning how to get out of the front door. So it’s good to have something to aim for.”There is something so distinctive, so heady, about a mother-and-baby screening: there is none of the urgent din that older babies make. It’s all snuffling, tiny croaks and squeaks, the sound of people coming to life in Dolby stereo. I took my son to these things a decade ago and I used to get furious when they put on a film that wasn’t adult enough. I remember complaining to my mother-in-law, when they screened The Golden Compass, the dramatisation of a Philip Pullman novel. She said: “Isn’t that about the occult? He shouldn’t be seeing that!” So I dropped that line of moaning, realising that we had more urgent work establishing a cross-family code about child-rearing and witchcraft. I am cast irresistibly back there, not so much by the noises and not at all by the smell (honest), but by that peculiar warmth in the room. New mothers are so nice to each other. It has to be some kind of evolutionary thing.Which is not to say that they are pushovers. Sasha Barton, with 11-week-old baby Otto, has had to cross (a bit of) London to the Ritzy because her local council shares Somerset’s high morals. Southwark also obliges cinemas to abide by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) guidelines, which means that children cannot watch an adult film, or a 12, even if they’re too young to know they’re at the cinema. “When I found out they were showing Crazy Rich Asians for the third time,” says Barton, “I phoned Southwark council to say: ‘Seriously, we shouldn’t have to watch this drivel.’ They said: ‘We take our safeguarding extremely seriously and those are the guidelines.’ But these are advisory guidelines. Of course, the final say is with the council. I’m a public law solicitor specialising in judicial review. It’s such a small thing, but it’s important.”It is always hard to explain why it matters: what is wrong with belt-and-braces advice? Is it the end of the world when those in authority over-interpret the rules, and overstate the risks? Bluntly, yes: it’s a subtle way of marginalising a parent’s judgment. When people say, “I do this to stay sane,” they are not just talking about the need to stay “in the loop”, as Esther described. Something in the spirit rears up against being warned of a danger that feels concocted.The tide does seem to be turning against parental hyper-vigilance, towards a more trusting creed that no one is perfect. As well as the standup comedy, Charlotte went to an NCT wine-tasting last week. “You don’t give it to the babies,” she explains, helpfully. “I don’t remember any wine tastings three years ago, or anyone drinking anything at all,” Jenny says. “Not because they didn’t drink just because they were breastfeeding.” Even at the most everyday level, Gemma says, attitudes have changed: “Five years ago, I remember mums wouldn’t even leave their baby crying while they brushed their teeth.”As for Skate Kitchen, it does have some adult themes, and would introduce babies, were they sentient to its messages, to dope, mildly offensive language, teenage defiance and sex. The core characters, a group of girls, spend an above-average amount of time discussing what their vaginas look like. It opens with a painfully evocative sequence in which the protagonist does herself a terrible skateboard mischief - they call it credit-carding – where you fall awkwardly and the board slices into your vagina. So I would say this is an incredibly insensitive film to show people who have just given birth, but the babies, I know with every fibre of my being, were oblivious.A mother who wishes to remain nameless – she was meant to return to work this week, I believe – has brought her baby who, at 11 months, is at the tail-end of the age range. “I literally know the timetables of every baby screening in every cinema in south London.” Her daughter beams at us: still too young to recognise a skateboard, or indeed anything else, she is getting towards the age of being too old, too alert, too bouncy, to sit through a two-hour film. Her next outing will probably be a Pixar toddler screening. Councils really don’t need to involve themselves in this the parent-child dyad has its own wisdom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1cd75f5b550ba9a5a792f26db5e0cb53914d211/505_317_5892_3535/master/5892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3cd5bebf75822665647d85532c573b1","title":"london house prices stamp duty brexit","story":"Average price of a home in the capital is £468,544, more than twice national averageHouse prices in London have fallen for the fifth quarter in a row as high prices, stamp duty changes and Brexit uncertainty put off buyers.Despite the fall, London remains the most expensive place to buy a property by some margin, with average prices more than twice the national average of £216,103.London has become a weak spot in the UK property market, with many homebuyers unable to afford a house after a run of strong price rises.Meanwhile, a higher rate of stamp duty on second homes has affected buyer appetite in London. And international buyers traditionally attracted by the London property market are being deterred by uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations, according to analysts.Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said that after a long period where prices rose faster in London than elsewhere in the UK, a period of under-performance was to be expected.“When you look at the affordability measures, such as house prices versus earnings, they look quite stretched in London compared with other parts of the country,” he said.“Much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates,” Gardner said.“Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed7304c39e6d7ff3e0f65bdc20c342f7eff58e3/0_139_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b5a656f3859aaad8bb6b14eff1dc264","title":"conference or crack den tories john crace","story":"Stupidity takes centre-stage, with equal amounts of inspired lunacy to be found on the fringesOnce you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains – no matter how improbable – must be the truth. Which means that the only rational explanation for the current behaviour of the Tory party is that most of its members are out of their heads on psychotropic drugs. The Birmingham conference centre has been transformed into the country’s largest crack den, with the entire cabinet and the gobbiest MPs fighting over what’s left of their stash while competing to pass off their version of fantasy as reality.We’ve already had the prime minister proposing we rerun the Festival of Britain to celebrate surviving Brexit. A Cliff Richard austerity singalong with everyone breathing a sigh of relief that they haven’t actually died. We’ve had Boris Johnson, a man who managed to waste £40m of public money failing to build a bridge across the Thames, going full psycho with a plan to build a bridge across the Irish Sea. Not to mention Jeremy Hunt in an advanced paranoid state claiming that we were in a gulag run by the EU.This wasn’t just a one-off, first-day collective meltdown, as every subsequent speaker appears to have taken all this as a benchmark of idiocy to which they should aspire.First on the main stage on Monday was Dominic Raab. Such is the febrile atmosphere of this conference that every speech is being viewed as a potential leadership bid, so Theresa May should be grateful that the Brexit secretary went out of his way to rule himself out. Almost certainly completely unintentionally.“The EU needs to get serious and do so now,” he demanded angrily. This didn’t get quite the reaction he had hoped. The hall may have had plenty of empty seats – anyone with a vestige of self-respect has long since run for the hills – but most of those who had chosen to endure the punishment beating just looked blank. No one wanted to be the person to tell Raab it had been the Tory government that had been taking the rise for the past two years and the EU had been deadly serious all along. He then went on to say he had nothing to offer but his blind optimism. No plan, just a wing and a prayer.Chris Grayling is almost always a guaranteed source of stupidity, but even so his performance was still a collector’s item. After insisting the Heathrow decision had been a no-brainer – it had to have been, otherwise he wouldn’t have been able to make it – he declared that post-Brexit Britain would be exactly like Monarch airlines. Bankrupt with tens of thousands of people in need of repatriation. Sensing he now had the hall in the palm of his hands, he concluded by saying that his priority was to complete the improvement to slip-roads in Thurrock, presumably so that they can be used as a lorry park. Failing Grayling is an example to us all that you really can be hopeless and still end up in the cabinet.It’s customary for the prime minister to be present for the chancellor’s speech. But as Philip Hammond wasn’t even present for his own gig, May clearly didn’t feel the need. Not for the first time, the Undertaker was completely out of step with his party. While the rest of them were mainlining amphetamines or taking psychedelics, Phil had stubbornly chosen to overdose on barbiturates. Every word was forced out. A struggle against unconsciousness. And not just because he had almost nothing to say. This was Phil as Philler. His final words were that the future laid with AI. You’d have thought the Tories had learned from their experiment with the Maybot.There were equal amounts of inspired lunacy to be found on the fringes. At a lunchtime meeting of the Bruges Group, Priti Patel, Andrea Jenkyns and Owen Paterson – aka Dumb, Dumber and Dumbest: the three desperados fighting over a single brain cell – could be heard reprising their favourite stories about how everyone was trying to prevent the one true Brexit to a near hysterical audience. “We are the mainstream,” said Paterson. The day Paterson, the man who blamed badgers for not making themselves available to be culled in sufficient numbers, is mainstream is the day most people head for the exits.To round off a hallucinatory day, we were treated to Jeremy Wright, the culture minister without a trace of charisma, trying to persuade the few dozen or so people still alive in the hall that he wasn’t a hologram and that he did really exist. Not even he appeared convinced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856ad7a54b88a3026f9745984b3a303bc8873c06/71_0_2477_1487/master/2477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6959b0d99f3cff09f2f67c0bc73021d0","title":"nobel prize in physics 2018 live","story":"American Arthur Ashkin, Frenchman Gérard Mourou and Canadian Donna Strickland share annual award for advances in laser physics• Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland win physics NobelThanks for joining us for the live coverage of the 2018 Nobel prize for physics. Don’t forget to come back tomorrow to find out who has scooped the prize for Chemistry.The last thoughts on today’s award are from Dr Amelle Zaïr from King’s College London, who is a lecturer in advanced photonics.“I am extremely delighted that the Nobel prize in Physics 2018 recognise the invention of optical tweezers and the invention of chirp pulse amplification technique to produce ultra-short and intense laser pulses. The latter being my field of research including attosecond physics,” she says.According to an interview from a few years ago, Ashkin felt a bit miffed that he had previously missed out on the Nobel prize when it was awarded in 1997 to a trio of scientists including Steven Chu, one of Ashkin’s colleagues, “for development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light.”Perhaps today’s news is some consolation...Here’s a video from a few years ago with Gérard Mourou talking about his work. Apparently he came up with a key idea when he was skiing. “You know when you are skiing you are spending a lot of time on the chair lift, you have no phone, nothing, just you and mother nature...”Al-Khalili says the subject matter of this year’s prize, is “tremendously exciting”. “Lasers are being increasingly used as instruments in scientific research, particularly in probing the quantum world,” he says. “Lasers can be used like tweezers to manipulate and move atoms around, they can pump atoms and molecules with tiny rapid pulses of energy to probe their behaviour, and they can even help us understand some of the secrets of the quantum world that play a role side living cells, in the new field of quantum biology, something I am very interested in.”Comment in from physicist and broadcaster Jim Al-Khalili. “The most thrilling thing for me is to see Donna Strickland share this year’s prize. It is quite shocking to know that she is only the third woman to win a Physics Nobel, ever! She is also the first female winner in 55 years, particularly when we consider great physicists who missed out, such as Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell Burnell,” he says. “It is also quite delicious that this comes just a few days after certain controversial and misogynistic comments made at a conference at CERN about women in physics.”The Wikipedia entry for Donna Strickland has gone from being non-existent this morning, to having multiple sections...More on how female scientists are missing from Wikipedia in this piece.More reaction on Twitter... There is another new record here: at 96 years old, Arthur Ashkin is the oldest person to win a Nobel prize.Lots of reaction on Twitter to the news that Donna Strickland shares the Nobel prize for physics – the third woman to win in the history of the prize. “We need to celebrate women physicists because we’re out there, and hopefully in time it’ll start to move forward at a faster rate. I’m honoured to be one of those women,” Strickland said on a phone call to the press conference.Others have said that Prof Strickland should be allowed to enjoy the prize, rather than being cast as a spokesperson for women in science:My colleagues Hannah Devlin and Ian Sample have put together a first take on this year’s award – check it out here.Optical tweezers sound a bit sci-fi, but they allow scientists to use radiation pressure to hold and move very tiny objects. This means scientists can hold even living cells in place, allowing them to probe their inner workings.That’s a wrap on the press conference! Here’s a useful graphic on Strickland and Mourou’s work from the Nobel prize team:Apparently Ashkin is so busy with his latest scientific paper, he might not be able to give interviews about winning the Nobel prize...Some reaction coming in from Andrea Taroni, editor of Nature Physics: “Optical tweezers are a huge deal in many domains beyond physics for the manipulation of nonoscale and biological objects, whereas high-intensity, ultrashort laser pulses are used extensively across physics and chemistry,” he said. “And there’s the small fact that Donna Strickland is the first woman to win the prize in 55 years – woop!”Strickland again: which field does she expect the technology to be useful in? “It is used in laser machining,” she says, adding that very large lasers are being built around the world for chemistry, physics, medicine and engineering. Her thoughts on receiving “the call” this morning: “First of all your have to think it is crazy...” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99edbcac18e459ebaf4d6484abc1b479cb553d5f/0_296_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016eae00429bbe21bb98c7eabf8a27a1","title":"brooks koepka ryder cup spectator","story":"• Corine Remande, blinded in right eye, may take legal action • ‘Clearly there is responsibility on the part of the organiser’The spectator whom Brooks Koepka hit with a tee shot at the Ryder Cup is considering legal action against the tournament’s organisers after losing the sight in one eye.One of Koepka’s drives on the opening day of the tournament flew towards the crowd and hit Corine Remande. “Doctors told me I had lost the use of that eye,” the 49-year-old told Agence France-Presse. “It happened so fast, I didn’t feel any pain when I was hit. I didn’t feel like the ball had struck my eye and then I felt the blood start to pour. The scan on Friday confirmed a fracture of the right eye-socket and an explosion of the eyeball.”Koepka was quick to make his way over to the crowd and apologise to Remande, who was later treated at an eye hospital in Paris. “Quite clearly, there is responsibility on the part of the organisers,” she said. “Officials did not shout any warning as the player’s ball went into the crowd. More than anything I want them to take care of all the medical bills to make sure there is no risk of infection.”Remande, who had travelled from Egypt to attend the tournament, also criticised the tournament organisers for “not making contact” with her following the incident.

Moreover, it pressured competing outlets to not only choose their words more carefully, but also the people who get to say them. In the wake of that controversy was born a new era of ersity in sports media that brought with it a heightened degree of cultural sensitivity.Still, for as much as sports talk has evolved in the decades since Snyder put his foot in his mouth, his ideas remain. The open and direct language of athlete stereotyping has taken on more subtle and nuanced forms. Often it’s being trafficked by observers who style themselves as egalitarian and unprejudiced. Sports imitate life and all its tribalism, in other words. The problem has only become more pronounced in today’s minute-to-minute sports news cycle. “It’s really hard to get sports journalists to consider the words, the framing and the context that their stories are put in,” says Dr Cynthia Frisby, a professor at the University of Missouri’s School of Journalism.Two years ago Frisby published a study examining the media depictions of black male athletes. What she found, after analyzing a decade’s worth of news clippings, was that black male athletes receive “significantly more negative coverage” in the form of hard news stories about domestic and sexual violence all the while their white counterparts are the hero protagonists of feature and profile stories that lay bare the shades of their humanity. The separate but equal reporting doesn’t just reinforce false notions about black athletes being more “naturally talented” than their “gritty” white peers. It lends credence to a spurious concept known as stacking, in which athletes are viewed as being particularly well suited to play certain positions based on race or ethnicity. Hiic baseball players experience this when they are typecast as shortstops and second basemen.A pair of 2017 studies out of the University of Colorado showed just how insidious that kind of thinking can be. In the first, researchers asked black and white college students to rate paragraphs and photos of pro quarterbacks based on parameters like physical strength and leadership, and the black participants wound up stereotyping both races of quarterbacks more strongly. In the second, Colorado researchers restricted the survey sample to white participants across a wide range of ages and education levels those participants wound up assigning negative stereotypes to the black quarterbacks, while assigning positive attributes such as leadership to white ones. The findings go a long way toward explaining why NFL fans are so quick to call for the benching of Cam Newton (a league MVP-winning quarterback who led his team to the Super Bowl), and why pro football scouts could feel so comfortable asking Louisville’s Lamar Jackson (who won the Heisman Trophy, awarded to the country’s best college football player) to try out at receiver in the run-up to this year’s NFL draft. These quarterbacks are competing against more than 400 years of accepted logic, after all.Athlete stereotyping might be even more engrained than it was in the time of Snyder or even the great Howard Cosell, who immolated his gilded announcing career the moment he called Washington receiver Alvin Garrett “that little monkey” during a 1983 broadcast of Monday Night Football. These days, people say more and hold back their true feelings even less. They engage more readily thanks to social media, where misinformation spreads far more easily. They hide behind their keyboards and let fly with their trolling in the comments section of news articles or on their anonymous social media feeds and shape perception. It’s how former Dallas Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant gets written off as an unemployable malcontent while Richie Incognito, a man with a history of throwing around racist slurs, is deemed worthy of second chances. It’s how Donald Trump gets to belittle LeBron James’s intelligence from the highest office in the land (and as the NBA superstar was opening a school, no less). It’s how Tim Tebow can be seen as reverent for kneeling on a football field, while Colin Kaepernick gets branded a traitor for doing the same.The more that people assert Jeremy Lin’s Taiwanese-American heritage disqualifies him for an NBA career or insist that the mostly poor, mostly black college athletes who rake in millions for their schools and coaches shouldn’t be paid is the more athlete stereotyping seems like a feature of sports conversation and not a bug. And somehow these beliefs persist even as sports are mythologized as safe playgrounds for fairness and inclusion. “I feel like we’re a boiling pot right now,” says Frisby, who only sees the problem getting worse as athletes speak out more. “People really don’t want to hear another side.”Even more troubling: athlete stereotyping has increasingly tangible effects and emboldens some truly disturbing behavior. According to research from the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Diversity and Ethics and Sport, acts of racism in American sports – such as the racial slurs hurled at the Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones during a game at the Boston Red Sox – soared from 11 in 2015 to 41 in 2018. Likely, that’s just the tip of the iceberg: there were 104 reported incidents of racism in sports internationally in 2016.Clearly, words matter. Words hurt. And yet there are few, if any, consequences for bigoted language – coded or otherwise. When the conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh moonlighted as an NFL analyst on ESPN 15 years ago and, as part of a barbed critique of Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, said “the media has been very desirous that black quarterback do well,” it touched off a national controversy. But Limbaugh wasn’t fired from ESPN or blackballed in the industry or shamed into oblivion he quit while he was ahead and resumed his work as America’s foremost right-wing agitator. “It saddens me to see how many media professionals are actually fueling the fire and proud to do it,” Frisby says. “It’s up to journalists to make sure that stops.”Given the fraught state of sports discourse, it’s no wonder that so many athletes are retreating to their Instagram and Twitter feeds, or the sanitized world of the Players’ Tribune. There at least, they’re free to define themselves on their own terms they can push back against the ugly tribalism in the arena or play past it. The more they post, the less they have need for the middle men in the press box. And while that’s an unfortunate development for ink-stained wretches like me, ultimately it may be for the best. The surest way for athletes to change the conversation around them is by leading it themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83233fae539cb47e861cd781e9fb0e334eff5ff0/0_63_3994_2397/master/3994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2a246eaf8c3d556a7ee89719385de84","title":"labour of love play maryland democrats","story":"The award-winning show about the Labour party has opened in Maryland and a Democratic congressman has found a string of parallelsThe bar is offering The Labour, “a refreshing gin-based cocktail with ginger beer”, and The Tory, “a more conservative Rye whiskey based cocktail featuring Campari”. These are unusual offerings for a theatre in Maryland. But it makes sense when you see what is happening on stage just a dozen steps away.The Olney Theatre Center is hosting the US premiere of Labour of Love, a play about the electoral agonies and ecstasies, and epic ideological struggles, of the British Labour party. Set in a Nottinghamshire constituency office, containing references to Robin Hood and Nottingham Forest football club, and running through names like Clement Attlee, Tony Benn and Neil Kinnock, it is not the most obvious hot ticket in American theatre.But it opened on Saturday night to plenty of laughs and a rapturous reception. Along with admiring James Graham’s sharply written play – winner of the 2018 Olivier award for best new comedy in the UK – the audience responded to parallels with American politics and, in particular, the battle for the soul of the Democratic party. “It’s hard to be left,” says one character. The Democrats have found that a lot in recent years.Among those applauding, as a guest of the , was Jamie Raskin, a left-leaning Democrat who represents Maryland’s eighth congressional district in the US House of Representatives. He says he found the show “spectacular” and “inspiring” ahead of next month’s midterm elections, even if he “was straining to remember the conflict between Healey and the Bennites and who was supposed to be on the left who was on the right”.In one key speech in Labour of Love, local MP David Lyons complains: “When we go ‘up’ in university towns and cities for the same reasons we’re ‘down’ round here. Lose the ‘heartlands’ for being too soft on immigration, lose the young metropolitans for being too hard. Too radical for the old, too safe for the young. Too soft-Brexit for Leavers, too hard for Remain. Too left, too right, too old, too new … all we seem to do, this party, long as I can remember soul-searching, introspection. How can we still not know, a hundred years on, who we fucking are and why …”The lament is likely to strike a chord with Democrats, who are thriving in university towns, especially on the east and west coasts, but who lost traditional “rust belt” heartlands to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential race. The party is strong among women, young people and minorities but struggles to make inroads among voters who are strongly religious, favour gun rights and oppose abortion.“I didn’t know the specific district they were talking about but you can make the same kind of play about the areas that we lost in the 2016 election, like in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania,” Raskin reflected. “Economic de-industrialisation and political disengagement happened in a lot of those places. We’ve got to be honest about the fact that Donald Trump ran to the left of Hillary Clinton on trade policy, on the Iraq war – he constantly attacked her for having voted for it – on political corruption, on her connections to Wall Street and so on.“Of course it was completely fraudulent on Trump’s part, and the minute he came in he turned the whole administration over to Wall Street and the most rightwing interests in the country. But this last two years has been a period of us trying to clarify the character of American politics for people and to remind people who we are. The Democrats have got to be the fighting progressive populist party.”Labour of Love deftly dramatises the schism between the centre and the left. The action starts in 2017 and winds backward to 1990 after the interval, it resumes in 1990 and barrels forward to 2017 again. Lyons is in the Blairite mould his agent, Jean Whittaker, is proud old Labour, grateful for three general election wins but worried that socialist principles have been sacrificed. The pair’s spiky relationship has earned comparisons to Benedick and Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing.Raskin said: “It was about this secret crush that the left Labour tradition and the centre liberal tradition have on each other. They obviously belong together. We’re not going to be able to win without that. In America I guess most recently our ide was between the Bernie Sanders people and the Hillary Clinton people but we’re not going to win unless we unify progressive populism and liberal feminism. Politics is a game of addition not subtraction and so it’s all about bringing people together and keeping things moving in a humanitarian direction.”Tony Blair was in power for a decade Barack Obama for eight years. Both earned praise for what they achieved and criticism for not doing more when they had the chance for being insufficiently bold and radical. In the American case, Obama’s signature healthcare reform was a prime example. “For me, the Affordable Care Act was imperfect progress,” Raskin said. “It was progress because we gave tens of millions of people health insurance but it was imperfect because it was not universal and there were lots of fateful compromises that were built into it.“That debate in the play rang true for me because there are those who will attack Obama because he didn’t go with single-payer. Obama did say that if we were starting from scratch, single-payer universal healthcare would be the right way to go, but we’re not starting from scratch and we’ve got this very powerful interest in the private insurance companies and hundreds of thousands of people who work for them. And what are you going to do with that?”Bill Clinton’s New Democrats were emulated by Tony Blair’s New Labour in the UK, riding a wave of optimism in 1997 after 18 years of Tory rule. The character Lyons insists: “You win from the centre, always … We have a leader who knows that ‘compromise’ is not a dirty word.” But whereas Hillary Clinton saw off the insurgent challenge of Democratic socialist Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary, Labour shifted left in 2015 when it elected Jeremy Corbyn as leader. Images of Sanders and Corbyn feature briefly on TV screens during the production.What does the centre mean, anyway? Raskin recalls running for the Maryland state senate in 2006, when he was warned that his proposal to legalise gay marriage was unrealistic and made him sound “extreme”. He responded: “It’s not my ambition to be in the political centre, which blows around with the wind. It’s my ambition to be in the moral centre and that’s why I call myself a progressive because I think our job is to find what’s right, the best that we can, and then bring the political centre to us and that’s what makes politics interesting and meaningful.“So I resonated with Jean when she said if it’s just about finding a mythical centre and taking a poll, you’re going to end up not standing for anything and not moving politics any place. When people say, ‘Pull to the centre’ I’m like, well, part of me agrees with that. I’m a middle child. I like being in the centre. But to me the centre is the moral centre to find what’s right. You start with what’s right. You bring the political centre to you.”Labour of Love’s transatlantic potential was spotted by Jason Loewith, artistic director of the Olney Theatre Center, who saw it during its London run last year and immediately felt he wanted to stage it before the midterms in America. “The questions that it asks about centrists versus ideologues are being asked by everybody right now, whether you’re on the right or the left,” he said. “So it just felt absolutely time. The echoes couldn’t be clearer to me.”“How much is replicable from one constituency to another is the question on everybody’s mind. It doesn’t even matter, Republican or Democrat: the question seems to be the same on both sides. Donald Trump’s election was our Brexit moment, of seeing the centre maybe isn’t going to hold in a progressive liberal way as we thought. I think people are going to find the parallels extremely surprising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b217c47c2bb6f538db1445e2f7c6d8a6656cea/820_467_5780_4013/master/5780.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ce5c1badfceb2bd55a96d8aa16eedc0f 1320w","title":"amazon raises minimum wage us uk employees","story":"Company says it has ‘listened to its critics’ as it increases US rate to $15 and UK to £9.50 Amazon has raised its minimum wage for British and American workers, in a major milestone for campaigners pushing for pay increases to tackle rising levels of poverty and inequality in both countries.More than 350,000 US workers will see the minimum wage increase to $15 (£11.57) an hour, while almost 40,000 UK workers will see their pay rise to £10.50 in London and £9.50 across the rest of the country.Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of the e-commerce company, which has become a byword in Britain for low-paying work in recent years, said: “We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead.”“We’re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.”The new Amazon UK rate is also higher than the wage level recommended by the Living Wage Foundation of £8.75, or £10.20 in London.The company said it had “listened to its critics” and promised the changes would apply for all workers, including those on full-time and part-time contracts, as well as seasonal and temporary staff hired by recruitment agencies.The increase comes a day after the UK chancellor, Philip Hammond, promised Britain would press ahead with a new digital tax on internet companies.

But can it be reformed?It is no secret that I hate The Apprentice, because this hatred tends to manifest itself in articles about how The Apprentice should definitely end now. Such as this one that I wrote in 2014 and this one I wrote in 2015 and this one I wrote in 2016, that effectively blamed the entire current US administration on the morality of The Apprentice. Last year, like an ageing covers-band hauling itself back onstage for a mediocre Freebird encore, I reverted to the hits and wrote something about how, you guessed it, The Apprentice should definitely end now.But none of these articles actually worked. The Apprentice, despite being roughly as enjoyable as getting pelted with sun-hardened donkey dung, inexplicably remains a thing. It is still a miserable, joyless, Brexity slog about big-tied dickheads failing to make any money in a series of repetitively menial tasks, then getting shouted at until one of them gets to leave in a taxi. But I cannot kill it. So, fine, you win and I lose. Hooray for The Apprentice. Whoopy doo.But if The Apprentice is going to remain bizarrely uncancelled for the foreseeable future, can’t we at least try to make it better? I have some ideas on how to improve the series, and I’d happily welcome yours. Together we can make this dreck very slightly less abject.My biggest gripe with The Apprentice is that every single episode is identical. If you have seen one, you have basically seen them all. A large part of this is down to the tasks, which invariably involve selling things. Sweets. Soap. Snacks. Part of the reasoning behind this obsession with selling is that it plays into Alan Sugar’s origin story as someone who got his start flogging scrap metal to the Krays as a toddler or whatever, but it is tedious to watch. Not only is it predictable (oh look, they are cold-selling to shops again) but it simply is not how businesses operate. Let’s have a more realistic episode where the candidates are dropped into a real-life failing business and have to sack some real people in person. Let’s have one where they are investigated for tax fraud. Let’s have one where they brace for a no-deal Brexit. Anything – anything – not to have to watch them sell sweets again.Nothing would improve The Apprentice like making the candidates live off their earnings as the weeks go by. So, in week one, they sell some sweets. There are eight people in the team, all working two full days to acquire and sell products, and at the end they make a group profit of £200. Instead of celebrating this as a towering achievement like the show usually does, let’s ide the winnings between everyone. Each candidate gets £25 for the task, or £12.50 a day, or just under £1 an hour to spend on food and bills and tax, and that is all they are allowed for the week. Let’s see how many private jets you can buy with that.One reason I hate The Apprentice is it celebrates denial of culpability. Whenever a team member messes up, it becomes their duty in the boardroom to protect their own failings by blaming everyone else with an increasing level of genuinely unpleasant viciousness. If they succeed, they are allowed to stay. If they crack and admit that they were actually at fault, they almost definitely end up being fired. Every significant problem this country faces stems from people who were unwilling to admit their own mistakes. It is ugly, and I blame The Apprentice for it.Fourteen years. The Apprentice has been on the air for 14 years (15 in the US), and every single candidate has been a dipstick. No matter their age or background, they’ve all been aggressive, oblivious, self-interested dipsticks. You’d have hoped that the dipstick well would have run dry long ago, but no. In fact, thanks to quotes such as: “There’s no need to watch your back when I’m already two steps in front,” they are perhaps more dipsticky than ever this year. Imagine how great it would be if you could actually relate to one of the contestants. Imagine if any of them, even for a single fleeting moment, were actually nice? Obviously this would kill the show if it ever happened, but you won’t hear me complaining about that.The Apprentice starts Wednesday 3 October at 9pm on BBC One"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99137837ef27e342c7682dd4f03f9c9e61bf0de4/0_105_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8d076cf020650c712e65bc34377f99d","title":"rupaul dragcon nyc in pictures","story":"RuPaul’s TV show Drag Race has brought drag queen glamour and wisdom into the living rooms of families worldwide.

Seven-year-old Alana was riding her bike wearing a Halloween costume. Her brother Troy, 10, was on a scooter.Jimena Barreto’s ageing, gold Mercedes was travelling at 50mph as it veered across two lanes of traffic in Danville, near San Francisco, jumped the curb and plowed into the family.Carmen was injured but managed to grab the car keys to stop Barreto from driving off. The 46-year-old nanny, who worked for several wealthy families, bolted on foot. She was found a few days later in southern California, by which time Troy had died.Barreto told the police she’d taken opioid painkiller pills and muscle relaxants, and blacked out at the wheel. Prosecutors suspected she was drinking, too, although she denied it.As Carmen Pack and her husband, Bob, mourned their children, they made a startling discovery. Barreto had multiple prescriptions for hundreds of opioid pills from six doctors – and they all worked in the same Kaiser Permanente hospital.The Packs couldn’t believe it. How could the doctors not know about each other’s prescriptions? How could the hospital not know either? Barreto went from one physician to another in the same medical complex collecting prescriptions for the opioid Vicodin and muscle relaxants by faking injuries.“She would just go to a doctor saying my back hurts, my arm hurts or my neck. All these fake things,” said Bob Pack. “She asked for the medication and they just gave it to her. I was incensed. How can these doctors be so irresponsible?”Pack set out to do something about it. He worked in technology as a former executive at America Online and knew it couldn’t be difficult to set up a database to keep track of opioid dispensing and prevent “doctor shopping” for multiple prescriptions.Pack was right about that. What he hadn’t counted on were the entrenched financial, medical and political interests that would turn implementation of what he regarded as a simple life-saving measure into a 15-year odyssey that is only now coming to fruition.Starting this week, doctors in California are obliged to consult a state-run drug monitoring database to check their patients’ prescribing records before giving them opioids and other controlled medicines. It’s a victory for the Packs, but one that came years after other states introduced a similar requirement because, he said, of the power of the medical industry and its lobbying in California.“I thought this would all be done quickly, like in two years, when I set out. I was just a guy that said: ‘This makes so much common sense and this could have prevented the deaths of my children and others.’ I just kind of figured everybody would be for it. But then I learned the reality of life,” he said.Carmen Balber, director of Consumer Watchdog, a group that campaigns on healthcare issues which backed Pack’s initiative, said a coalition of medical providers, insurance companies and doctors groups fought hard against obliging physicians to check on the prescription histories of patients not just in California but other states.“Bob fought for many years to pass legislation requiring the use of this simple tool to identify dangerous prescribing to no avail because of the continued and strident opposition of the California Medical Association, the hospitals and the insurance industry and the political allies they fund in Sacramento,” she said.While California’s opioid death rate was far below some of the worst hit states, such as West Virginia and Ohio, the total number deaths was significant, running into the tens of thousands over the past 15 years because of its large population.California’s pharmacy board said that doctor shopping was so easy that one patient visited more than 100 physicians over four years, collected opioid prescriptions from nearly 60 pharmacies and was dispensed 45,000 doses of painkillers worth close to $1m on the street. The lack of prescription monitoring also helped shield those doctors who made huge profits giving large amounts of opioid painkillers to anyone who asked, such as Lisa Tseng, the first physician in the country convicted of murder for prescribing enough to cause at least six deaths and probably more.Pack was glad to see Barreto convicted of second degree murder, because she had previous convictions for driving under the influence, and sentenced to 30 years to life in prison. But he thought responsibility for his children’s deaths ran much wider.“There were six doctors prescribing to her for a long time. They never talked to each other or shared a medical file. She would go in one week, get 60 Vicodin, and a week or two later go in and get another 60 from a different doctor,” he said. “I thought, aren’t they required to share medical files so they know what they’re doing? Isn’t there some kind of computer system where they can look that up or track it? I couldn’t believe that there wasn’t any of that.”When Pack dug into it he discovered there was already a system in place going back to 1939 requiring California pharmacists to report the narcotics they dispense to the state’s justice department. In 1997, it was turned into a database – the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System, known as Cures. But it was so antiquated that drugstores were still filing reports by fax. It took weeks to enter the data and then it mostly disappeared into computer files, never to be looked at again.Pack began lobbying members of the California legislature to modernise the system and require doctors and pharmacists to use it. He saw it as working much the same as gun shops carrying out background checks in minutes.Pack won support from some members of the legislature who sponsored a bill to upgrade the Cures system, but it passed with a rider saying that the improvements must not cost the state of California money. The result was a relatively slow system that was of little practical use to doctors under pressure to cycle through patients every few minutes.Finally, a decade after the death of Pack’s children and following years of campaigning, the state legislature imposed a levy on on doctors’ and pharmacists’ license fees to upgrade the system.But then the real battle began. Cures would only be effective if doctors were obliged to consult it, and the California Medical Association (CMA) was among the most vocal opponents. It told legislators that mandatory prescription monitoring would impose “an unnecessary bureaucratic burden” on physicians and prevent pain patients from getting the medicine they need. At the same time, the association also claimed that there was no need to make the system compulsory because its members would sign up in droves.Pack met repeatedly with the CMA to try and get it on board.Pack joined others to push a California ballot measure in 2014 requiring doctors to use Cures. The CMA and other medical groups spent $92m to defeat the measure. They placed adverts claiming that Cures was “a vulnerable government-run database containing your personal prescription drug history, open to law enforcement, hackers, identity thieves or simply accidents”.The San Jose Mercury News described the adverts as “shamelessly deceptive”, noting that the Cures database had been around since 1997 and never been breached. The Sacramento Bee called the advert “an outright lie” and the Los Angeles Times described the claims as “baloney”.The issue returned to the California legislature in 2015, by which time increased public awareness of the opioid epidemic was shifting. But at a state Senate hearing, the CMA again objected to a law making Cures compulsory by saying it “will create an unnecessary regulatory burden to prescribing and increase the threat of litigation, both of which would have a detrimental impact on patient care while adding limited value to addressing prescription drug abuse”.Pack was incredulous. California had prescription monitoring before any other state, yet it was being left behind by similar programs in other parts of the country that were clearly effective.Kentucky, Tennessee and New York all saw a significant drop in opioid prescriptions after they required compulsory checks. The US department of health called Kentucky’s program, launched in 1999 and made mandatory six years ago, the “gold standard” for prescription monitoring.“Kentucky has seen its ranking among states with the highest nonmedical use of prescription painkillers drop from second to 31st place, reflecting a drop that officials attribute largely to its monitoring program,” a report by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration said last year.The position of the CMA and other medical institutions finally shifted in 2016 in the face of public pressure. Politicians who had overwhelmingly sided with the industry, and more often than not received large campaign contributions, abruptly changed their positions and Cures was made mandatory – although it would take more than two years for the requirement to be put into effect because of the CMA’s resistance.“The political reality of the opioid crisis, the thousands of people who are dying every year, became overwhelming. It was impossible to ignore,” said Balber. “But the CMA never removed their opposition to the mandatory use of Cures. We never saw the medical association reversing position and saying: ‘You’re right. Cures should be mandatory. Every one of them that should check it.’”The CMA sidestepped a series of questions about its long opposition to the legal requirement for doctors to consult Cures, including its claims that the system would created regulatory burdens and increase the threat of litigation even though that was not the experience in other states. It also did not directly address a question as to whether the association now supports mandatory consultation of Cures by doctors.The association claimed that the questions were “outdated” because, in effect, they have been overtaken by the law. It also maintained that its opposition was largely driven by concerns about the operational shortcoming of Cures even thought the objections made to the state legislature went much wider.The CMA’s president, Dr Theodore Mazer, issued a brief statement in response to questions.The number of opioid prescriptions has been falling across the country, in part because of greater doctor awareness of the epidemic and new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But Pack and others wonder how many of those now dying amid the surge in lives claimed by heroin and a synthetic opioid, fentanyl, were drawn into the epidemic by the unrestrained prescribing of painkillers.Pack is glad to see the measure he fought so long and hard for finally introduced, but the struggle took its toll.“Early on, I was working out of anger and frustration because of the deaths of my kids. But over the years, just for my own emotional sake, I had to calm down because I would get so impatient over the fighting. With politics, a year or two is nothing. They have tricks in their bag where they can delay and delay and delay,” he said.Pack is glad to see the measure he fought so long and hard for finally introduced. The couple rebuilt their lives and have another daughter now, Noelle. But the struggle took its toll.“I couldn’t fight it out of anger any longer,” he said. “I had to keep at it with an attitude of just common sense persistence and the fact that if I keep at it, it’ll save other lives. I had to take a much calmer approach because it was hard on me too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d41405b32a9b544a189e6e6976554c8d3e70b2/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6fe91b0139c18781e3ff51c62173a8e7","title":"safiya wazir new hampshire refugee state representative","story":"Wazir and her family fled Afghanistan when she was six.

If she can win the general election in November, she will become the first refugee to hold office in the state.Her victory was in a small race in an outlying part of New Hampshire’s capital, a neighborhood known mostly for its dying shopping mall, the ision of motor vehicles office and long string of fast-food restaurants. But the race mirrors what has been happening on a broader scale elsewhere: young, progressive women of minority backgrounds have launched and won insurgent campaigns. “Having somebody young, new blood in the system, I think it would be really helpful for all, from seniors to immigrants and refugees. That really gives a new perspective,” Wazir said.Wazir’s journey into politics was a difficult one.Arriving in the US, her first impressions of Concord were of loneliness and huge piles of snow.Wazir and her parents found themselves alone in a strange country where they could not communicate with anybody. They were helped by a Lutheran organisation that assists with refugee resettlement in the area, but the food they were provided with was unfamiliar, like peanut butter and sliced bread. Unsure of how to prepare what they were given, her mother would just cook rice, which they would eat on the three plates they were provided. When their case manager would come by their home to check on the family, Wazir would try to draw the items they needed.To learn English, Wazir studied a well-worn Dari-English dictionary and paid close attention to what native speakers said. As a refugee in Uzbekistan, she had to learn Uzbek and Russian her third foreign language came easy to her.She started working jobs at Walmart and Goodwill not long after she began high school to help her family make ends meet. After she graduated in 2011 aged 20 – older than most students as she had to restart her secondary education – she decided to attend the New Hampshire Technical Institute, a local community college. She took night classes so she could continue working, but that meant graduating took five years.In 2013, she gained American citizenship and was pregnant with her first child.“It was a beautiful moment. I couldn’t hold back my tears,” she said. “I said: ‘I’ve finally found my home where I can deliver my baby as a proud mom of a US, American citizen.”However, she now worries that others may not be able to follow in her footsteps.Just days after Wazir’s victory, the Trump administration announced that the US would take in a maximum of 30,000 refugees next year, down from a cap of 45,000 this year and 50,000 in 2017. Donald Trump has made limiting immigration a key point of his administration and has repeatedly painted refugees as potential threats to the nation’s security.Between 2010 and 2017, 1,422 refugees were resettled in Concord according to statistics from the New Hampshire department of health and human services. While seemingly not an overwhelming number, their presence was felt in a city of just 43,000.Many of Concord’s refugees have settled in the Heights, the neighbourhood where Wazir’s race is taking place. The majority of refugees there are Bhutanese and several stores selling south Asian foods and spices have been established on Loudon Road, the main thoroughfare of the Heights.Downtown Concord is festooned with the flags of different nations as the city celebrates its ersity with its annual welcoming week. But not all in the city are pleased by changing demographics.In losing the primary, Patten lashed out at recent immigrants.At the polls, he told the Concord Monitor that minorities who recently arrived to Concord were “getting everything”. Speaking to the Boston Globe, he said: “It used to be the Heights would support a Heights person … but the Heights has changed, basically, from what it used to be. We have many immigrants in there now, and she’s from Afghanistan so she was treated like the princess.”He also questioned how Wazir – who has two daughters and is pregnant with a third child – could balance motherhood with public service.Patten now plans on backing Wazir’s Republican opponent, Dennis Soucy, in the general election. He told the Globe he was backing Soucy because the Republican had been in the Heights for decades.In an interview with the  in her Concord home, Wazir said she was choosing not to respond to Patten’s statements except to say that immigrants like her are a part of the city’s fabric today.“We’re also part of the community,” she said. “We also work hard for New Hampshire. We pay our taxes. We earn money and we spend it here.”She does not credit her victory to the growing immigrant community in the area she says it was her persistent door-knocking in the neighbourhood and interactions with the people of the Heights that won her the primary.But immigrants and refugees in Concord could again become a flashpoint in the general election.Posts on the public Facebook page of her Republican challenger point to hardline anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views.On 12 September, the day after the primary, Soucy shared a meme depicting what appears to be a smiling Middle Eastern man with the words: “We can kill as many as we want and your stupid government keeps letting us in.”Another meme shared by the account in August reads: “Muhammad owned many slaves. Robert E Lee was against slavery. So why are we tearing down statues instead of mosques?”In a written statement to the , Soucy charged that Wazir has never voted, does not know the community and does not have the best interests of the community in mind. Wazir says she has voted in local, state and national elections, has been a part of the community for 11 years and is committed to representing the Heights.While Soucy provided a written statement to the  after being contacted multiple times, he was not open to responding to specific questions. After the  inquired about his stance on immigration and asked about the memes on his Facebook page, one of the memes was deleted.Wazir says she has tough skin as a refugee in Uzbekistan, she faced discrimination and her classmates taunted her by calling her a “terrorist” because of where she was from. Despite the openly anti-immigrant attitudes some people in the state hold, Wazir says she has been comfortable in New Hampshire and not run into discrimination.The New Hampshire Young Democrats helped Wazir organise her campaign and reached out to voters by mail and text on her behalf. The group’s president, Lucas Meyer, said Wazir’s victory was a very promising sign.“There are some ugly spots in this where people made some pretty disgusting remarks about her win, but I think the overwhelming majority of response has been incredibly positive,” he said. “In an otherwise pretty depressing, isive political world right now, this is a moment of clarity and inspiration for a lot of people.”One of those inspired already is Rajesh Chauwan, who came to the US as a Bhutanese refugee a decade ago and works at the New African Asian Market in the Heights. He said he was excited by Wazir’s victory and what it would mean for New Hampshire’s refugee and immigrant communities.“That will encourage the population,” he said. “Now we can do something in our new country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53a19d602a927447cf87ef65e8ebe249bb2fcf20/0_73_4975_2985/master/4975.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96d5def13d65f21ef141667ebdbfbfde","title":"how to be good man me too month reading feminist classics","story":"A year after the first Harvey Weinstein revelations, how can men show solidarity with women? One Swedish professor decided it was time for some deep reading“He covered my mouth with his hand and introduced his penis. I thought my last hour had arrived. I had the feeling my stomach was turning.”These are not the words of a woman testifying as part of the #MeToo movement, and they are not the words of Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the US supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last week – although the hand over the mouth, if not the reference to the penis, mirror her words. (Kavanaugh denies the allegations.) This is, instead, the experience of a young woman as recounted by the French feminist and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir in her 1949 classic The Second Sex.I took that book down from the shelf about a month ago it had sat there, untouched, for years. How many times had I pretended to have read it, nodding knowingly when someone mentioned it at a dinner party, or in a seminar at the Swedish university where I work?A year after the first revelations about the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, I wanted to to sit down and read about women’s experiences, to stay silent for a while, and hopefully learn something. It has been painful to listen to the stories of systematic sexual abuse that have emerged as a result of the #MeToo movement, and also an education it has forced me to see things I had failed to see in the past. Before, I knew sexual assaults were endemic, but I didn’t realise they were this endemic. I also understood that the blame is often put on the victim. But I had never really seen this, not in such a concrete and shockingly visible way.It has been a late awakening and, over the course of the year, a couple of overdue questions emerged: what can men do to show solidarity with women, and what can we do to address a culture of toxic masculinity and begin examining ourselves?There is clearly more than one way to do this. The journalist Richard Godwin has described in the  how, in his quest to examine modern manhood, he found groups where men were doing “breathing exercises, talking about their fathers, pretending to be tigers, leaning in on one another, working out which Jungian archetype we vibed with, and trying to articulate why we all felt so defensive and angry and misunderstood so much of the time”.I opted for a quieter approach, following the advice that, to show solidarity with the movement, you could begin by seriously listening to women. So I decided to spend the month leading up to the first anniversary of the Weinstein revelations reading some feminist classics, which, for inexplicable reasons, I had never got round to. I’m sure there are embarrassing and unflattering underlying reasons for this omission, but I’m not sure what they are. Perhaps it was as depressingly simple as the fact that the works of (white) male authors had always been closer to hand – through reading lists and book reviews and recommendations – than the works of (black) feminist writers.With the help of two editors from this newspaper, a list of 13 books was compiled – far from comprehensive, but including some of the most influential feminist works of the last few centuries. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, 1792 The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir, 1949 The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, 1963 The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer, 1970 Woman Hating, Andrea Dworkin, 1974 Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis, 1981 Sister Outsider, Audre Lorde, 1984 Gender Trouble, Judith Butler, 1990 Feminism Is for Everybody, bell hooks, 2000 Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg, 2013 Men Explain Things to Me, Rebecca Solnit, 2014 Bad Feminist, Roxane Gay, 2014 We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 2014.In early September, I started reading. Halfway through De Beauvoir’s The Second Sex, I came across a passage that seemed to sum up the shocking insight of #MeToo. De Beauvoir writes that almost all young women, including what she calls “well-protected” ones, have been exposed to “regrettable incidents”, which, in conventional circles, are “hushed up by common agreement”.This reminded me of last autumn, and the experience of watching the evening news with my wife and eight-year-old daughter as the welter of #MeToo allegations began. The news anchor read out some of the testimonies that had been shared on social media. Usually, when horrible things are reported, we could, as a well-protected family, who previously lived in Wales, now in Sweden, calm my daughter down by saying that these things hardly ever happen in our neighbourhood. But we couldn’t do that now. These regrettable incidents could not be hushed up by common agreement.De Beauvoir tells the story in her book of a young girl, no more than 10 years old, who is molested by her grandfather. She cannot find the courage to tell her parents. De Beauvoir writes: “Such incidents are usually endured in silence for the little girl because of the shame they cause. Moreover, if she does reveal them to her parents, their reaction is often to reprimand her. ‘Don’t say such stupid things … you’ve got an evil mind.’”I remember reading the detailed allegations against Jean-Claude Arnault, the influential cultural figure who is married to one of the members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel prize he used to casually call himself the academy’s 19th member. In an article published in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper, 18 women came forward to tell their stories. In graphic detail, they described instances of abuse and rape, and like Weinstein, Arnault was accused of exploiting his power to threaten and blackmail women. He was alleged to have targeted, in particular, those who were weak, vulnerable and “damaged”. On Monday, he was convicted of one count of rape and sentenced to two years in prison. The other cases were dropped for lack of evidence or because they had exceeded the statute of limitations.Only four of the women who testified against him showed their faces. They were the ones who had rejected him outright when he had tried to grope them in bars and elsewhere. Never before had I quite grasped the shame of being the victim as I did when reading this line, from one of the women who had been raped and did not show her face: “I was ashamed I was one of those he chose as victim, to be one of the ‘damaged’ women.” Worse than simply being the victim, he had chosen her as his victim, because she was “damaged” and too weak to say no.I had known, for a long time, that blame is casually ascribed to women who are attacked. I had known this, in theory, as an abstraction. I wonder why #MeToo had to happen for this to stop being an abstraction to me. This story has, after all, been told a thousand times before. It was there, in large print, in the books I read throughout September. I mean, is it possible to read the following story, from Gay’s Bad Feminist, and still think of shame as an abstraction? She writes about an 11-year-old girl who was raped by a group of boys and men in Texas, and the fact that the New York Times chose to headline their story Vicious Assault Shakes Texas Town – as if we should feel sorry for the town and the boys. “It was an 11-year-old girl whose body was ripped apart, not a town,” Gay writes. “It was an 11-year-old girl’s life that was ripped apart, not the lives of the men who raped her.”A few weeks after the allegations against Weinstein began emerging, a liberal columnist in Sweden wrote that we need to distinguish between real victims and fake victims, claiming that, if all women were as thick-skinned as his 19-year-old daughter, there would be no #MeToo. The problem, he wrote, was that too many women want to assume the role of victims. Their problem is that they don’t know how to say no and to stand their ground.“It never crossed my mind to say no or that I should say no, that I could say no,” writes Gay. When she was 12, a boy she thought was her boyfriend started pressuring her to have sex. One day they were riding their bikes in the woods. She didn’t know that his friends were waiting for them by an abandoned hunting cabin. The boy pushed her to the ground and took her clothes off. She was raped by the group, who kept her there for hours. “I felt fear but I didn’t know how to say no.”After she was raped, Gay didn’t say a word to anyone. She didn’t want to get into trouble. “I was a good girl, so that’s what I did.” In class the next day, one of the boys leaned towards her and said: “You’re a slut.”A few days after the liberal columnist said women should be more like his 19-year-old daughter, hundreds of Swedish women, all actors, came together under the hashtag #SilenceAction, publishing a long series of detailed accounts of brutal sexual assault.Here is one of the many testimonies. In a hotel, after a party, a woman is on her way into her room. A man – a world-famous actor – follows her. He pushes her to the floor and throws himself on top of her. “Now he’ll rape me,” she remembers thinking.I wanted to ask the liberal columnist: how would your thick-skinned 19-year-old daughter deal with that?Before #MeToo, I had not really understood the connection between power and sexual abuse. I had seen it, of course. But again, only really in theory, as an abstraction.In Men Explain Things to Me, Solnit writes that she surprised herself once when she began an essay by recounting what was, ostensibly, a funny incident – a man refusing to be interrupted while explaining, in great detail, the content of a book she had actually authored. That same essay ended in her writing about rape and murder. These incidents are situated on a continuum, she argues, which stretches from “minor social misery to violent silencing and death”.“Dead men don’t rape”, read a poster that used to hang over Dworkin’s desk. By the time I’d read a third of the books on the list, I didn’t blame her. In the acerbic pages of Woman Hating, Dworkin writes that, as a woman, you have to ask yourself a number of pressing questions: “Why everywhere the oppression of women throughout recorded history? How could the Inquisitors torture and burn women as witches? How could men idealise the bound feet of crippled women? How and why?”There were books on my list that were not quite as brutal books less concerned with rape and sexual oppression than with the cultural pressure on women and how to be a woman. At the end of Wollstonecraft’s A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, she sets out a future “experiment”, by which women would share with men “the advantages of education and government”. In The Female Eunuch, Greer argues that women need to stop seeing themselves as wives and mothers because, confined to these roles, their “horizon shrinks to the house, the shopping centre and the telly”. By 2013, Sandberg, the chief operating officer at Facebook, was writing from a business perspective about the need for more women in leadership roles. Her advice to women, expressed in the title of her book, is to lean in – to do what you would do if you weren’t afraid.I nodded my way through these books, recalling the discussions that started at my university about a year ago when, emboldened by what seemed like a revolutionary moment, we discussed a range of radical ideas to facilitate the career possibilities for women, from offering significant research time to women to recruiting women to senior academic positions. One year later, these initiatives have boiled down to a not-so-radical mentoring programme.If these books were familiar, written from a predominantly white, privileged perspective, the next titles were not. Davis begins Women, Race and Class by describing the life of the female slave. Davis notes that, while white women of the abolitionist movement spoke out on behalf of black women, they were unable to grasp the slave woman’s condition, because the black woman, through her experience of hard work, rape, flogging and resistance, had developed traits that set her apart from the white woman. The black woman, like working-class women, worked until they could work no more. They could only dream of the life of the white housewives.One of the problems with the women’s movement, Lorde writes in Sister Outsider, is that “white women focus upon their oppression as women and ignore differences of race, sexual preference, class and age”. As a consequence, “women of colour become ‘other’, the outsider”.As I finished the last book, I was thinking about all the men – and many women – who refuse to call themselves feminists. The writer bell hooks says that whenever she introduces herself as a feminist, people respond that feminists are lesbians who hate men and want to make life miserable for white men. When she then asks them about the feminist books they’ve read, they go silent.We need to “create a mass-based educational movement to teach everyone about feminism”, hooks writes in Feminism Is for Everybody, and I can’t stop thinking that this is what #MeToo is.Sure, #MeToo is many things, and some feminists, including Greer, have openly criticised the movement. It has been suggested that many of the incidents are too minor to warrant serious attention, and that women should be better at saying no and reacting immediately if assaulted.I’m reminded of this when I speak to a female friend, a few days before finishing this article. When she says she is surprised to learn I am “pro-#MeToo”, I find myself responding defensively, assuring her that I do recognise some unfortunate potential side-effects. As if to avoid the broader questions of #MeToo and feminism, we end up discussing the tragic case of a man who killed himself after allegations of sexual abuse that later proved false.A year after the first Weinstein allegations, it could be tempting to look back and focus only on examples of where #MeToo went wrong. But we need to remember why the movement, first started by the civil rights activist Tarana Burke in 2006, had to take the form it did. It is not as if these stories are new. They just hadn’t been heard properly. And that was one of the most uncomfortable insights from reading these books: that the stories of sexual abuse that emerged last year had been there all along, for centuries. They just hadn’t been discussed, publicly, in the way they have now.A year ago, in the , the writer Emily Reynolds asked what men could do to examine themselves and show solidarity with the movement she advised men to ask women questions and start listening. I’m sure there is much to be learned from going on a man camp and discussing masculinity with other men, but I believe the simple advice from Reynolds is potentially more powerful: ask, read, listen, widen your perspective, call your own perspectives into question.We hold feminism to an unreasonable standard, Gay writes, as though both feminists and feminism must be flawless. She says she is not very well versed in feminist history. She has a wardrobe full of shoes and bags. She listens to sexist rap and reads Vogue. But so what? She is full of contradictions, like everyone else.“I would rather be a bad feminist than no feminist at all,” she writes, and on reading this line, I see an opening, an invitation to me and all the other men who wish to be supportive. I think: if she can be a feminist, then maybe we can, too.Even though, of course, I’m sure I’ll be a much worse feminist than she is.• A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft, 1792• The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir, 1949• The Feminine Mystique, Betty Friedan, 1963• The Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer, 1970• Woman Hating, Andrea Dworkin, 1974• Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis, 1981• Sister Outsider, Audre Lorde, 1984• Gender Trouble, Judith Butler, 1990• Feminism Is for Everybody, bell hooks, 2000• Lean In, Sheryl Sandberg, 2013• Men Explain Things to Me, Rebecca Solnit, 2014• Bad Feminist, Roxane Gay, 2014• We Should All Be Feminists, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, 2014.• The Happiness Fantasy by Carl Cederström is published by Wiley.

The era of Portuguese colonialism was ending, the fight for independence that would become one of the many proxy battlefields of the cold war was intensifying and, after three months spent on dangerous roads and in a capital city growing more paranoid and hallucinatory by the day, the Polish Press Agency reporter was spent.“My money ran out and I am barely alive,” he wrote. “It is more or less clear what will happen, which is that the Angolans will win, but it is going to take a while and I am on my last legs.”Kapuściński, long acknowledged as one of the greatest journalists of the 20th century for his literary evocations of wars and revolutions in Africa and Latin America, was right on both counts.He was haunted by what he had seen, what he had done – and what he had failed to do – while the nascent conflict he had chronicled would stagger on until 2002.The experience provided him with the raw material for Another Day of Life, his deeply personal book “about being alone and lost” in the chaos and confusion of Angola.Eleven years after Kapuściński’s death, the book has been adapted into an award-winning film that mixes animation and documentary to retell and update the story.The idea came to the film’s co-director, Raúl de la Fuente, and his producer and partner, Amaia Remírez, when they were on holiday on Menorca 10 years ago. The Spaniards had loved Kapuściński since they were teenagers, and saw Another Day of Life as both a geopolitical parable and a portrait of a journalist enduring a dark night of the soul.One of the main challenges they faced was how to evoke the sense of confusão “a state of absolute disorientation” – that permeates the book. The answer lay in Kapuściński’s two-notebook habit: one for straightforward, factual reporting one for impressionistic observations and reflections.While De la Fuente and Remírez travelled to Angola to shoot documentary footage and track down the book’s surviving protagonists, the Polish animator Damian Nenow took on the task of translating Kapuściński’s brutal poetry for the screen. “His descriptions of the world and how it changes are pure animation – they just cry out for animation,” says Nenow.The journalist’s thoughts, fears and recollections are rendered in surreal sequences of disintegrating cities, bodies and even a fragmenting telex machine. In one of the film’s most stunning scenes, Kapuściński and an Angolan journalist, Artur, come across a long stretch of road littered with the corpses of civilians, and imagine them being slaughtered by a cloud of weapons that roils a red sky.“We never debated whether it was right or wrong because it somehow felt natural in the context of Kapuściński’s writing,” says Nenow. “This guy wasn’t following facts per se he was always showing the world through the prism of the emotions of the people he met. He was always adding a lot of allegorical magic and poetry to it.”Accusations of “not following the facts per se” – or of simply inventing episodes – were levelled against Kapuściński in a biography published eight years ago, which claimed he had crossed the line between reportage and fiction.Nenow acknowledges the controversy, but says Kapuściński remains an iconic figure in Poland, where, he says, people have long been aware of his approach. “Kapuściński’s books are obligatory in school you have to read them when you’re a teenager. So it’s not a surprise for any Polish person – it’s not rocket science – that he was not strictly following facts.”Another Day of Life ends with the journalist speculating as to the fates of some of those he met in the confusão of 1975: Artur, the bright young guerrilla Carlotta, and the Che Guevara-like figure of Comandante Farrusco, a Portuguese special forces soldier who swapped sides to fight for liberation.It was that epilogue that gave De la Fuente his way into the film, which is released in Spain this month and is due to reach British cinemas next year. “I had the chance to go back to Angola with my camera and look for them, and say, ‘Look Ryszard, here’s Artur’, who feels like the biggest loser in the war because the society he wanted never materialised, ‘here’s Farrusco’, who’s still a soldier, ‘here’s Carlotta’s sister’. I felt I had to fulfil a commitment to him and I wanted to answer his questions.”Not long before he died in 2007, Kapuściński and Farrusco managed to speak by phone with the help of the Polish ambassador in Angola. The former commando, who still addresses people as “comrade”, is now 70 and his bones have begun to ache as he tends his garden.Time, however, has done nothing to diminish his affection and admiration for the middle-aged Pole who materialised at his redoubt almost half a century ago, an unexpected emissary from a habitually indifferent world.“Kapuściński was a born writer and he’s someone who’ll never be forgotten in Angola,” says Farrusco. “He knew what injustice was. He wasn’t just a journalist. Journalists sometimes do in-depth reporting from war zones but Kapuściński was a man of principle. I don’t have the words to describe exactly what his presence and personality meant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17501494b9f3ea61415163a9d525983838bffb42/0_260_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c83f75b95bdd96f5d9a84f1c59fb54ed","title":"spanish pm accuses catalan president of encouraging radicals","story":"Riot police clash with activists outside Catalan parliament on anniversary of referendumThe Spanish government has accused the Catalan president of “encouraging radicals” after a day of protests to mark the first anniversary of the region’s unilateral independence referendum ended with riot police charging demonstrators outside the Catalan parliament. About 180,000 people were estimated to have gathered in Barcelona on Monday to commemorate the vote and show their support for Catalan independence, many of them carrying banners reading “1 October, no forgiving, no forgetting”.During the peaceful demonstrations city streets, motorways and a high-speed rail line were blocked, and activists attempted to surround the Catalan parliament and the Barcelona headquarters of the Spanish national police.Catalonia’s nationalist president, Quim Torra, had praised those undertaking direct action earlier on Monday, urging them to “keep up the pressure”.The Catalan police force, the Mossos d’Esquadra, said 30 of its officers were injured on Monday night as they tried to stop protesters forcing their way into the regional parliament and demonstrating outside the police HQ.Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, urged Torra to rein in those responsible for the violence. “Catalan politics has to come back to the Catalan parliament,” he tweeted on Tuesday morning.“President Torra needs to fulfil his obligations and not jeopardise the political return to normality by encouraging radicals to besiege the institutions that represent all Catalans. Violence is not the answer.”The scenes of unrest will be damaging for the Catalan independence movement, which has always prided itself on being peaceful and democratic – even in the face of the violence used by Spanish police to prevent the referendum.But with the movement increasingly ided and political progress limited, its radical sectors are growing impatient at their leaders’ failure to deliver the republic they promised and some have called for Torra to resign.The former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont, who fled to Belgium after the Spanish government sacked him and his cabinet for staging the referendum, was among the first to criticise the masked activists who had tried to enter parliament.“If they’re wearing hoods, they aren’t 1 October people,” he tweeted. “If they use violence, they aren’t 1 October people.

Six of the men are believed to have died.Ngati Oneone has long opposed having the controversial statue of Cook placed on the sacred mountain of Titirangi, and on Monday the Gisborne district council said it would be moved to the Tairawhiti Museum instead.The council would also consult with the local community regarding the renaming of the Cook Plaza on top of Titirangi, as well as various walking tracks and sites on the mountain.Meredith Akuhata-Brown, a local councillor, told Maori Television the removal of the statue would allow a more nuanced and “honest” story about New Zealand’s history to emerge.Discussions are under way in the Gisborne region for Poverty Bay – so named by Cook in 1769 – to be replaced by its Māori name, or given a dual name.Akuhata described the name of Poverty Bay as “horrendous” and said it was particularly painful as the region had numerous social and economical challenges it was working to overcome."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648835.1538477433!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"welfare payments delayed due to european banking issue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMany parents across the country woke on Tuesday to discover their monthly child welfare benefit of €140 had not reached their accounts. Social welfare recipients, including parents who receive child welfare benefits, did not receive their monthly payment on Tuesday because of a European “industry wide payments issue”.Many parents across the country woke on Tuesday to discover their monthly child welfare benefit of €140 had not reached their accounts. The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection confirmed a European bank payments issue was affecting some social welfare payments due to be paid into personal accounts.The department said it had processed all its payments as usual and that officials from the department had contacted the main banks. “We understand that they are working to resolve the widespread payments issue as quickly as possible,” the department said a statement, adding it would continue to monitor the situation and update customers on its website and via social media. A spokeswoman for the department said the delay in payments was a general banking issue and not specific to welfare payments. However, the absence of child welfare payments would be most noticeable given that they are paid on the first Tuesday of every month. She added that affected banks had said the problem should be resolved and payments issued by the end of the day.The Banking \u0026amp Payments Federation Ireland said shortly before 11am that processing had recommenced and that all customers would receive payments into their accounts in the course of the day. Ulster Bank said on Twitter it was aware of an “industry wide payments issue” that had delayed some credits being applied to Republic of Ireland bank customer accounts. “Investigations are ongoing to be able to apply these credits to customers accounts as soon as possible.” A statement on the Permanent TSB website confirmed that payment transactions between banks had not been received on Tuesday morning due to a “European payments delay”. “This means that any payment due to transfer to your account from another bank this morning has been delayed,” it said. “We are monitoring the situation and payments will be processed as soon as received.”An Post said in a tweet its counter services had not been affected by the issue and customers who normally collect their child benefit payments in the local post office could do so. A spokesman for AIB said all incoming payments to bank customers had been processed. However, the bank noted on Twitter it had been advised of delays with incoming credit transfer from EU payment systems and were investigating the matter. In a statement, Bank of Ireland said all payments between BOI customers and between BOI and AIB had been processed over night and were up to date. However, it warned that there had been a delay in processing payments from “some other institutions” following a central European bank issue which had affected all SEPA system banks. The monthly welfare benefit of €140 for families with one child is usually paid on the first Tuesday of every month. Families with two children receive €280, with three children receive €420 and four children €560. Separately, the Green party called on Monday for the Department of Social Protection to urgently address delays of up to five weeks in illness benefit payments to patients.“The withholding of payments to patients when they are unwell is shocking and unwarranted and should be immediately addressed,” said Green party health spokesperson Dr Séamus McMenamin, adding that it was unclear why the department had changed to a new paper-based form ahead of the move to electronic certification next year.“There is a marked change in practice and increased workload which needs to be negotiated with GP representative organisations. Patients should not be disadvantaged in the interim.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Inquest adjourned until and unless all criminal proceedings are completeDanny Whelan admits murdering the 31-year-old in Waterford in April last yearChild welfare recipients affected by Europe-wide banking systems glitchLouth TD says he has a problem with abortion and cannot \u0026lsquovote in favour of 12 weeks\u0026rsquoEuropean Commission has called for end to daylight savings practiceDUP leader says it is not a \u0026lsquosacrosanct\u0026rsquo piece of legislation in context of Brexit negotiationsPigs, pigeons and chimpanzees can remember the what, where and when of an eventGeneva body condemns Alessandro Strumia for \u0026lsquoattacks on iniduals\u0026rsquo in presentation \u0026lsquounacceptable in any professional context\u0026rsquoOireachtas committee to raise questions on latest security issue affecting 50m usersEU working on minimised checks plan in bid to sell Border guarantee compromise to UKEU negotiators work on softening \u0026lsquobackstop\u0026rsquo plan to give political cover for compromisePoliticians to be targeted over departmental control and perceived humiliation of forcesEmergency meeting of top officers convened as reservists drafted to fill gaps on third shipBen Gilroy also forbidden from acting as legal adviser to othersSurvivors say they were shown file on Bill Kenneally but board failed to notify GardaDonohoe to hold meetings with FF to obtain assent for budget day packageProposed route advanced by planners includes 18km link between east and west of cityMinister expected to rule out granting military personnel the right to strikeThousands of businesses being extorted by paramilitaries, says senior PSNI officerParliamentary Budgetary Office advises broad, non-volatile tax base in budget"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648197.1538425544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"crew shortage prevents naval service vessels setting sail","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted recently to supplement crew shortages on the LÉ Eithne, the navy’s flagship. Photograph: APTwo Naval Service vessels were unable to set sail last week because of a crew shortage while reservists have been brought in to plug gaps on a third ship, it has emerged.Emergency talks were held last Friday in Haulbowline between Chief of Staff, Vice-Admiral Mark Mellett, Assistant Chief of Staff Brig Gen Peter O’Halloran and the Flag Officer Commanding, Cmdr Mick Malone.Meanwhile, the issue of shortages in the Naval Service, the Air Corps and the Army is expected to feature highly in the annual PDForra conference of non-commissioned officers.The LÉ Orla, a coastal patrol vessel, and the LÉ Niamh, a large offshore patrol vessel, were unable to leave their Haulbowline base, it is understood.Members of the Naval Service Reserve were drafted in recently to supplement crew shortages on a third ship, the LÉ Eithne, a helicopter patrol vessel that is the navy’s flagship.Shortages are such that Naval Service personnel are being asked to return to sea early, sacrificing part of their pre-planned shore leave. This has prompted a level of dissent from some of those asked.Retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne said the relationship between the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence is now “toxic, broken, dysfunctional and dangerous”.Key to the current problems, said the senior ex-officer, who has been critical of military pay levels , is the “long term political and institutional neglect and indifference towards the Defence Forces”.Lieut Col Earnán Naughton, general secretary of Raco, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, said the Defence Forces’ “governance and command structure is breaking down”.“Within the Air Corps, there is a 30 per cent shortfall in pilots and technicians which means the service is operating at less than 70 per cent capacity,” he said. “Army officer corps strength is about 40 per cent down.Senator Gerard Craughwell said Naval Service petty officers and senior non-commissioned officers have been asked to take up lower-ranked duties to make up crew numbers so ships can get to sea.Staffing difficulties are linked to the problem of retaining Defence Force personnel. But strained relations between senior officers and the department run deeper than just this issue.An example cited is how the department treated a joint submission to the Public Service Pay Commission which is looking at pay rates, particularly rank-and-file earnings and restoration of pay cuts.The Defence Forces were asked to tell the department what they wanted, which senior officers did in writing but then heard nothing back until after the submission was forwarded directly to the commission.Last night, the Defence Forces press office said Vice-Admiral Mellett “received briefings regarding naval operations and the challenges associated with the delivery of Maritime Security and Defence services” in Haulbowline.The departmentsaid naval reservists had been given training recently. The service has 92 per cent of its numbers, it added.Recruitment is continuing and staff will get pay rises worth between 6.2 per cent to 7.4 per cent. In addition, they will enjoy the restoration of the 5 per cent allowances cut under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648190.1538425342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces veterans claim lack of respect being shown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRetired Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan and his grand-daughter Aleesha Penrose (9) at an Army protest in September: 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement, a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families, says Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsRetired Defence Force veterans are planning to mount a highly visible public campaign in which politicians will be targeted over what the retirees see as a lack of respect being shown to serving Defence Force members and their families.The perceived lack of respect manifests itself in the relationship between, on one side, the Defence Forces and, on the other, the Government and Department of Defence as well as in the Government’s approach to general pay and conditions within the Defence Forces.According to retired Regimental Sgt Maj Noel O’Callaghan, a leading member of a close-knit group steering the campaign, 1,760 Defence Force members are on family income supplement – a fact seen as a collective humiliation of military personnel and their families.The Defence Force establishment is supposed to be 9,500 personnel across the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. However, at present it stands at some 8,800, many of whom, particularly the rank-and-file members, are struggling financially.Depletions have opened holes in all ranks, including skilled cohorts, such as pilots and aircraft technicians, and further up the command structure, as well as among mechanics and communications officers in the Naval Service, according to sources.The Department of Defence is seen by campaign members as treating the Defence Forces with a degree of contempt. Uniquely in terms of the public sector, the head of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff, is not his own “accounting officer” which means that, even when a budget has been agreed for the Defence Forces, he cannot spend within the agreed parameters without reference back to the department.The actual accounting officer for the Defence Forces, the person with responsibility for recruitment and retention policies, is not the Chief of Staff but the secretary general of the department.The need for departmental approval for almost everything is seen as being insisted upon to an absurd degree.As another of those supporting the campaign, retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne, puts it: “If a local community group came to me to ask could they borrow a tent for a one-day parish event and I had a spare one, I would still have to ask some junior official in the department if it was okay to lend it. Escalate that situation to a critical level of command and control and you can see there’s something wrong.”The campaign aimed at politicians will be rolled out for next May’s local government elections, and also should there be a general election in 2019.Minister of State with responsibility for Defence Paul Kehoe (constitutionally, the full minister is Taoiseach Leo Varadkar) got a foretaste of the campaign last Saturday when retired Defence Force personnel paraded outside his constituency office in Wexford.Service defence force personnel are prohibited for strike action, or anything of a similar nature, and also from political involvement. Retired members retain a reluctance to stage political displays, preferring the parade option instead.The campaign will be overseen by five retirees, including Sgt Maj O’Callaghan, and, later this month, they plan to meet and agree the message which they hope local activists in each of the general election constituencies will deliver to candidates.The campaign “will target the message to inidual candidates who are not cognisant of the needs of the Defence Forces”, says Brig Gen Aherne, adding the veterans want “the military family to vote strategically”.Attention is likely to focus on sitting TDs connected to the current Government.“We would encourage veterans to parade in front of every Fine Gael TD’s constituency office, every Independent Alliance TD and the three inidual TDs – Michael Lowry, Sean Canney and Michael Harty – supporting the Government. We are looking for respect and loyalty for the Defence Forces,” says Brig Gen Aherne.He cites several measures needed urgently to address the crisis.There should be a commission to address the relationship between the department and the Defence Forces there should be a reactivation of the Council of Defence, a formal body in which the department and senior officers are supposed to meet but which, according to Brig Gen Aherne “has not met for years because it is a statutory body and the department doesn’t want anything on the record” the implementation of the 2015 White Paper on Defence, and immediate discussions on the implementation of the European Union working time directive.Brig Gen Aherne says also that the operational implications for the Defence Forces in relation to anything that Brexit might throw up have yet to be fully considered.“When the Western Brigade, of which I was the last General Officer Commanding was collapsed – by ministerial order – responsibility for the entire Border was transferred to the brigade headquarters in Rathmines.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648751.1538468533!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"facebook data breach 5m accounts in eu may be impacted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Irish Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for regulating Facebook’s data processing activities in Europe, says it is concerned about the breach. Photograph: Getty About 5 million European accounts may be impacted by the massive data breach affecting the accounts of 50 million Facebook users worldwide, it has emerged. The social media company reported on Friday it had discovered a security issue that allowed attackers to exploit a vulnerability in its code. This affected the “View As” feature, which allows people to see what their own profile looks like to someone else, therefore leaving user’s data exposed. The chair of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Hildegarde Naughton, is to raise the Facebook data breach at the committee’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon. In its announcement in a blog post on Friday, Facebook said it was taking the issue “incredibly seriously”. The Irish Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for regulating Facebook’s data processing activities in Europe, said it was “concerned that this breach was discovered on Tuesday and affects millions of users”. It said at that time Facebook was “unable to clarify the nature of the breach and risk to users” and that it was pressing the company to “urgently clarify these matters”. In a statement on Twitter on Monday evening, the commission said it understood the number of potentially affected EU accounts “is less than 10 per cent of the 50 million accounts in total potentially affected by the security breach”. This means about 5 million of the users affected by the breach may be in the EU. “Facebook has assured us that they will be in a position to provide a further breakdown in relation to more detailed numbers soon,” the commission added.Facebook says its data regarding the geographic location of its users is based on a number of factors, such as the user’s internet protocol (IP) address and “self-disclosed location”.It says these factors may not always accurately reflect a user’s actual location. Ms Naughton said on Friday it was “quite alarming Facebook users have suffered such a data breach”.She said it highlighted “the precarious nature of uploading sensitive or personal content into the trust of social media giants”.“What security measures are in place for account holders and what are Facebook doing to prevent such a future occurrence? These are just some of the questions that we require answers for.”Facebook has also faced scrutiny this year over how third parties use its data after it emerged in March that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user data and used it in political campaigns.In June, Facebook apologised to 14 million users that posts they intended to share privately may have been published publicly because of a bug affecting its “audience selector” tool, which allows users to decide whether to publish a post only to their friends or to a broader audience. Because Facebook’s main establishment in the EU is in Ireland, the Irish Data Protection Commission is the “lead supervisory authority”, or regulator for the company. New powers granted to the EU’s data protection authorities under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allow the imposition of fines of up to €20 million or 4 per cent of total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. However, under the regulation, any penalties imposed on data controllers must also be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive”. The commission also has the power to order companies such as Facebook to provide it with any information it requires in order to investigate such data breaches, and to carry out investigations in the form of data protection audits.Facebook, which has its headquarters at 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, California, employs over 30,000 people worldwide, including about 2,500 in Ireland. It claims 1.47 billion daily users as of June this year and reported $40.7 billion in revenues, or $15.9 billion in net income, in 2017.Under the EU regulation, all data protection authorities, including the commission, have extensive powers of enforcement. This includes the power to obtain access to any premises of a data controller or processor, and to its equipment. They may issue warnings that data processing activities infringe, or are likely, to infringe provisions in the regulation. They may also issue “reprimands” where processing operations have been in breach of the law and they may order the data controller or processor to bring their data processing operations into line with the regulation. The data regulators may specify the manner in which this is to be done and they may specify a timeframe within which it has to be done. Data protection authorities also have powers to order data controllers to notify the iniduals impacted in a data breach. They may impose a “temporary or definitive limitation” on their activities, including a ban on processing personal data.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire DUP leader Arlene Foster has said the Belfast Agreement should not be considered untouchable in Brexit negotiations.Speaking to the Daily , Mrs Foster said it was not a sacrosanct piece of legislation.She said: “It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted Remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we can’t touch the Belfast Agreement.“Things evolve, even in the EU context.”Mrs Foster also said she wanted to see more focus on the positives of Brexit.“I think the reason why so many people are turned off by Brexit is because they are being fed a diet of negativity - whether it’s infighting, Brussels, being disrespected by people over there.Mrs Foster was speaking ahead of the Tory party conference where Boris Johnson will use his speech to issue a clarion call to activists to “believe in Conservative values”.In what will undoubtedly be seen as a pitch to replace Theresa May as leader, Mr Johnson will not only restate his opposition to the prime minister’s handling of Brexit but call on Tories to focus on law and order, tax cuts and house-building in order to defeat Labour.As Mrs May celebrated her 62nd birthday, Mr Johnson was pictured jogging through a field near his Oxfordshire home, in a photo apparently designed to mock the prime minister’s famous memories of “running through wheatfields” as a mischievous schoolgirl.Mrs Foster praised Mr Johnson’s “belief” and “spirit” and said she’d be happy to work with him as prime minister.“People want hope, they want to be positive,” Mrs Foster told the newspaper.She also said she would look at any new offer to the European Union on the Irish border, but Northern Ireland must leave on the same terms as rest of Britain.It was separately reported on Monday British Prime Minister Theresa May said she is preparing to make a new offer on the border aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Brexit negotiations.“We should wait to see what the text actually says in relation to any offer that has been made to the European Union,” Ms Foster said.“We always said that we have just the one red line - we cannot be separated from the rest of the United Kingdom, from a constitutional position and also from an economic reason as well.”Meanwhile, the DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson said fixation on the Irish backstop is getting in the way of a deal that would be good for everyone.If people stopped being so pessimistic and put half as much effort into entering a trade agreement between the UK and the EU “then we would all be better off,” he told RTE’s Morning Ireland.Responding to Mrs Foster’s remarks saying she could work with Boris Johnson if he became UK prime minister, Mr Donaldson said she had said there was “a lot of solidity in what he said,” but that did not necessarily mean she supports him.It all depends on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, if there is a no deal scenario, then there will have to be a change in how northsouth institutions operate, he said.Mr Donaldson said he wants to see the Belfast Agreement continue. Ms Foster had been reflecting the reality of what could happen in a ‘no deal’ scenario.“We would be deluding ourselves if we think that (no deal) would not change the way we do business.”He gave the example of the single market for the island of Ireland. If there is a no deal outcome then that will have implications and adjustments will have to be made.In response to a Times of London report that Mrs May will put forward new proposals on the backstop which would involve the UK remaining tied to the EU’s customs rule book beyond the two-year transition, and until a mutually acceptable technological solution on the Irish Border could be found, Mr Donaldson said that such a proposal had not been put to the DUP.“It is a speech from one paper. We are meeting the prime minister this afternoon, let’s see what she has to say today. But it’s not just a matter for the prime minister, it is for the EU and the Irish Government too.” – Additional reporting PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648842.1538477333!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"peter fitzpatrick i felt i was just there to push a button","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeter Fitzpatrick will stand at the next election as an Independent candidate.

Mr Fitzpatrick confirmed on Monday he was resigning the Fine Gael whip and will stand at the next election as an Independent candidate.His resignation reduces Fine Gael’s Dáil strength from 50 to 49 TDs.

Peter Fitzpatrick’s seat is safe, he asked me to stay. I said ‘no’.” He said Mr Varadkar had known he was unhappy and he had expressed his opinions openly at party meetings.“When the Taoiseach called me, he said this Government is going to go on for longer than anticipated, maybe a deal has been done between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.”Mr Fitzpatrick also claimed Fine Gael was more interested in style than substance and said middle class households were not being looked after.When asked on RTÉ’s Sean O’Rourke programme whether the 8th Amendment had influenced his decision, he replied: “that’s only one thing. I do have a problem with abortion. There’s no way Peter Fitzpatrick is going to vote in favour of 12 weeks.” Asked whether he would support the Government during votes on the budget Mr Fitzpatrick said he would, once the Government “look after the middle class”. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was sorry Mr Fitzpatrick had made this decision. “I know that he has been unhappy for some time and was a strong opponent of holding a referendum on the Eighth Amendment,” Mr Varadkar said. “I spoke to Peter a few weeks ago when he decided not to seek a nomination to contest the next general election as a Fine Gael candidate. “At the time, he confirmed that he would continue to sit, act and vote as a Fine Gael TD until the end of his mandate. I regret that he has since changed his mind. “Fine Gael is confident that it will retain its two seats in the Louth constituency.

Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand AFPGetty ImagesTwo weeks. That is the time the UK has to present its own guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border and prevent negotiations slipping to a crunch EU summit in November and ever closer to a hard Brexit. Just six months before the UK leaves the EU, the notorious “backstop” – the fall-back solution to the post-Brexit border if it is not sorted in a future trade deal – remains no closer since both sides agreed there should be one last year.British prime minister Theresa May agreed in March to include a legal text on an operable backstop – but just not the backstop that the EU has proposed. It would break up her country, she has consistently argued, as it would mean two customs unions within the UK by keeping Northern Ireland under existing EU economic rules.\u0026nbsp EU negotiators are still waiting for May’s own proposal so both sides can start negotiating on a legal text and get down to the business of drafting that has been absent from negotiations for many months. In simple terms, the legally operable backstop – a last resort should all other options fail – is essentially a manual to follow to avoid checkpoints springing up along the new 499km EU-UK frontier from Carlingford to Foyle after the UK departs the EU in March 2019.“This is a legal text it is not a political declaration,” said one EU source. “It cannot be fudged. It has to be legally watertight.”Warnings about the threats to the constitutional integrity of the UK raised the political temperature in the Brexit negotiations and the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has since the summer been trying to “de-dramatise” the backstop in order to resolve the last big remaining issue to agree a withdrawal treaty.\u0026nbsp Should May’s backstop proposal materialise in time and Barnier tells the EU leaders at the European Council summit in Brussels on October 18th that both sides are within touching distance of a deal, then they may agree to\u0026nbsp arrange a special Brexit summit probably during the week beginning November 12th. Finding agreement before then may take the heat out of a November meeting.The border issue rests on the geographical scope of the backstop: whether it extends UK-wide (which London has proposed and Brussels has rejected, and hardline Brexiteers within the Conservative Party don’t like) or a Northern Ireland-specific solution (which Brussels has proposed and London has rejected). It appears an eitheror choice given the economic and political complexities around this conundrum of whether or not the UK stays in the EU customs union. The UK wants to protect the constitutional integrity of the UK. The EU wants to protect the integrity of the EU’s single market.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp The EU would likely agree to the UK staying if it remained fully aligned with EU rules. But since the UK would then have to \u0026nbspapply the external tariff on all non-EU goods, it would \u0026nbspnot be able to \u0026nbspagree trade deals with other countries – a red line for the UK.Last month’s informal EU summit in Salzburg left May desperately clinging onto her “Chequers plan” – which would keep Britain aligned to European standards on goods and food – despite being dismissed by the EU as unworkable and rubbished by the hard Tory Brexiteer rebels ahead of her party conference this week. To create wriggle room, EU negotiators are behind the scenes preparing an “improved” backstop, softening the language to try to take the political heat out of the border issue. They are planning to play down the need for extensive checks between Northern Ireland and Britain that would create a border in the Irish Sea or on the island under its backstop. They may also be willing to agree to a strong political statement saying they believe the backstop will never be used and a commitment to resolve the border issue in a deep trade agreement that will make all trade between the UK and EU as frictionless as possible. Brussels sees this as a way to give May political cover at home. Noises out of London yesterday suggest that May may be working on some kind of hybrid proposal – a UK-wide customs backstop along with Northern Ireland-specific regulatory alignment with the EU on goods that would require some checks between Northern Ireland and Britain.She has yet to formally present her counter-proposal on the backstop – a kind of emergency custody arrangement for Northern Ireland if there is to be a orce before future living arrangements are agreed by the parting couple."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Fears of growing lawlessness in Palu as president orders more rescuersSurvivors stream away from ruined homes as thousands try to get on flight at airportMagnitude 7.5 earthquake triggers tsunami that devastates part of island of SulawesiIbrahim Mohamed Solih declares India as \u0026lsquoclosest ally\u0026rsquo after recent pivot towards ChinaFormer intern being sued by TV host Zhu Jun after she accused him of groping herThe number of cases rises sharply this year to 820,000 peoplePresident Michael D Higgins sends condolences as over 400 people confirmed deadThe president\u0026rsquos direct acknowledgement could add weight to criminal court inquiryChinese media describes the claims as a ploy by the US president to win support in pollsIndian penal code section deemed \u0026lsquoarchaic, arbitrary and unconstitutional\u0026rsquoChina\u0026rsquos top naval officer cancels talks with US top brass over US decision to impose sanctions for China\u0026rsquos purchase of Russian weaponsNarendra Modi accused of cynicism for \u0026lsquoModicare\u0026rsquo initiative ahead of general electionAldi Novel Adilang (19) rescued by Panamanian-flagged vessel in waters off GuamElection result extraordinary rebuke to Abdulla Yameen, who jailed political opponentsRobots are involved in mission that aims to shed light on origins of the solar systemCommunist Party control of worship to continue under Catholic Patriotic AssociationAustralian brand withdrawn after punnet in Auckland supermarket found to have needlesJames Ricketson (69) had been visiting Cambodia for more than 20 years\u0026lsquoReform through education\u0026rsquo call for Muslim region comes amid international criticism\u0026lsquoHe suffered from a highly virulent virus\u0026rsquo for which there was no treatment, says minister"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3648803.1538474026!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit eu is sticking to ireland first stance on border says junker","story":"The discussion in Britain over its departure from the European Union is still far removed from reality, the European Commission\u0027s president Jean-Claude Juncker said at a forum in Freiburg.  Video: European Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, speaking in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Photograph: EPA European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has reiterated to British prime minister Theresa May that there must be agreement on the Irish border if the UK wants a Brexit deal.Despite the rejection of key elements of Mrs May’s Chequers blueprint for Brexit at last month’s informal summit in Salzburg, Mr Juncker said the EU still wanted an agreement.However, addressing the European Parliament in Strasbourg ahead of the next EU summit in Brussels later this month, he stressed the EU would not compromise on key principles.“We will have an interesting meeting as far as Brexit is concerned. We want to have a deal. Those who think a no-deal would be a better solution are not aware of the difficulties such a scenario would imply,” he said.“When it comes to the Border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we are sticking to the point of view we have expressed so many times - Ireland first.”The summit on October 18th to 19th has been billed as the “moment of truth” when it will become clear whether it is possible for the two sides to do a deal.Mrs May has said the Government is working on new proposals to resolve the issue of the Irish Border - ensuring there is no need for the return of “hard border” controls - although it is unclear whether they will be ready in time for the Brussels meeting.The parliament also heard renewed criticism of foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt over his comparison of the EU to the former Soviet Union. Manfred Weber, the leader of the main centre right grouping in the parliament, said Mr Hunt needed to apologise for his comments.“Now we experience a new level of populism when the foreign minister of Great Britain, Hunt, is comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union,” he said.He quoted Polish former foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski who said: “Please Mr Hunt, show us the gulag, please Mr Hunt show us the Soviet Union army troops in your country, please show us the Stasi system in your country.”He added: “So Sikorski is right. Mr Hunt, you should apologise for what you have said.”Mr Hunt’s comments were welcomed by former Ukip leader Nigel Farage, who said the foreign secretary had been echoing a view he had expressed for years.“For a decade here I have noticed that that centralising authoritarian tone began to sound very much like the old Soviet Union,” he told the parliament.“To see the British foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt now using that language means we have shifted the centre of gravity, we have shifted this debate.”The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MEP Diane Dodds - whose party props up Mrs May’s Government at Westminster - warned they would never accept the “impossible demands” of the EU for a “backstop” which would see the imposition of customs controls between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK if the two sides failed to reach a wider agreement on trade.“The idea, as proposed in the backstop, that we would allow Northern Ireland to become some sort of semi-detached part of the United Kingdom is both offensive and outrageous,” she said.“Protecting the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom is a red line that cannot be broken or bent.“When it comes to the stability of the United Kingdom and the security of Northern Ireland’s place in it - mark my words, we are not bluffing.” - PA Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireThere are exactly six months to go before Britain leaves the EU. With time running out to reach a Brexit deal, Theresa May is confronted with the choice she has tried to avoid since becoming prime minister: retaining unfettered access to European markets or bolstering the UK’s autonomy.The EU has given Britain until mid-October to strike a deal that will avoid creating a hard border with Ireland – the biggest remaining obstacle in the orce talks.But the two sides also have to come to an initial understanding on Britain’s long-term relationship with the bloc, which could determine the country’s trajectory for decades.The challenge for the prime minister is to find a solution acceptable both to Brussels and the House of Commons that will achieve an orderly Brexit and reduce the uncertainty hanging over business and the economy.For months she has sought to square the circle with her so-called Chequers proposal, under which Britain would follow the EU’s rule book for goods trade, but go its own way on services and the free movement of people.But Chequers is opposed by some 60 Conservative MPs and the opposition Labour party. European leaders at this month’s Salzburg summit also objected to it as cherry-picking that could allow the UK to undercut Europe’s stringent regulations.Here are the remaining options open to the UK and the EU – their prospects for resolve the Irish border question their likely economic consequences and their chances of success.EEA membership would ensure that goods and services sold in Britain were automatically free to be sold in the rest of the EU. Britain would need to align with European rules for goods and services.To ensure frictionless trade – avoiding customs declarations for goods at ports – the UK would need to retain membership of a customs union with the EU, precluding separate trade deals with other countries.Many advocates of this option see this as an interim, medium-term phase until technology can resolve Irish border issues.George Yarrow, chair of the Regulatory Policy Institute and emeritus fellow of Hertford College, Oxford, has long favoured this stepping stone route for Brexit. “In the long run, a customs union is a seriously inhibiting factor for the UK as a global trading nation,” he said.Solved as long as the UK remains in a customs union.This is the least damaging form of Brexit. The government estimates that there will be a hit of 1.6 per cent of GDP to the economy once customs barriers are erected, but this will be significantly less – 0.5 per cent – if Britain stays in the customs union. The government also estimates that there would be no detrimental effect to public finances.The EEA option would be acceptable in Brussels. It has some support in both the Labour and Conservative parties. But it is not acceptable to Mrs May because it would violate her red lines on three issues: European courts having a role in Britain freedom of movement and the ability to strike trade deals ahead of leaving the EU customs union.A customs union with the EU would give the UK autonomy over its services, which comprise 80 per cent of the economy, while keeping its membership of the single market in goods and agriculture. Border issues would be resolved but almost all free trade agreements with other countries would be prohibited.The withdrawal of Britain from the single market in services would be a hit to the economy. The OECD estimates that services trade barriers within the EU are four times smaller than those between the EU and non-members.Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said that a middle way “guarantees a reasonable level of trade access to the EU” but there would be costs in “continuing uncertainty over the trading relationship for some time”.The government has not produced an exact estimate of the costs, but its models suggest a long-term cost of 3 per cent of GDP from the gradual ergence of services regulationA possible compromise but unlikely to satisfy many people. Theresa May would balk at the membership of a customs union Brexiters would complain of their inability to strike trade deals and the common regulation of goods Brussels would see a British attempt to cherry pick the single market. This would be tough to negotiate.The hard Brexit option. The UK would have autonomy to set its own regulations, and its immigration and trade policies. There would be no tariffs between the UK and the EU, but there would be significant non-tariff barriers from customs and regulatory checks at borders.Julian Jessop, chief economist of the Institute of Economic Affairs, who supports this option, accepts that there would be costs. “Trade with the EU will not be as frictionless as now,” he said.He stressed that it is much easier to measure costs of a policy than its longer-term benefits, but he believes there are many potential gains for Britain from autonomous regulations and trade policy.“An FTA is the combination that has the best chance of minimising the additional costs and maximising the potential benefits,” he said. “I can’t say with a high degree of confidence whether this is definitely better or worse than the current relationship as an EU member. But this action would give us the best possible chance”.Would require a technological solution, which is currently unavailable, or agreement that Northern Ireland would have a different customs regime and separate goods regulations from the rest of the UK.The vast majority of economists suggest this would be the most painful form of Brexit: additional trade barriers would be large while potential benefits of trade deals with the US and other countries would be small.The government model suggests a long-term hit to the economy of just under 5 per cent of GDP. Most other estimates are in a similar range. The IEA is an outlier. It calculates net benefits of up to 7 per cent of GDP, once many trade deals had been signed and what they call improved regulation are introduced.Acceptable to Brussels, so long as Britain agrees to the Irish backstop, under which there is no hard border iding the island of Ireland, and to many Brexiter-Conservatives. However, it is unacceptable to Mrs May, on the grounds that the Irish backstop would tear apart the integrity of the UK.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Solid is how we evolve the web in order to restore balance – by giving every one of us complete control over data, personal or not, in a revolutionary way.Applications developed through Solid may have a similar function and feel to familiar apps – such as chat apps,\u0026nbspvideo-sharing sites and music players –\u0026nbsphowever there is one key difference: All data that passes through them is under the control of the user.But while the decentralised platform aims to wrest power away from\u0026nbspinternet\u0026nbspgiants like Amazon, Facebook and Google, the effort will need to be huge to have any kind of impact.Facebook and Google now have direct influence over nearly three quarters of all internet traffic, thanks to the vast amounts of apps and services they own that\u0026nbspincludes YouTube, WhatsApp\u0026nbspand Instagram.\u0026nbspBerners-Lee, waves as he in introduced to the audience during the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games (Getty Images)To realise this vision, Berners-Lee has founded a new company called Inrupt, which will provide the necessary infrastructure to support Solid.\u0026nbspHe will also be taking a sabbatical from MIT and his other projects in order to\u0026nbspdedicate his time to Solid and Inrupt.People want to have a web they can trust. People want apps that help them do what they want and need to do – without spying on them, he wrote.Apps that don\u0027t have an ulterior motive of distracting them with propositions to buy this or that. People will pay for this kind of quality and assurance... It is going to take a lot of effort to build the new Solid platform and drive broad adoption but I think we have enough energy to take the world to a new tipping point.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

On Twitter, she added: Trust me it\u0027s worth the wait.Appearing on TMZ, West himself confirmed the delay, saying that he hoped to record in Africa later in the year. “It’s just a full Ye album, and those five albums that I dropped earlier were like superhero rehabilitation,” he said, referring to the five albums he produced and released earlier in the year.ORIGINAL: Considering how sporadic and temperamental West’s current behaviour appears to be, there’s no way anyone can know for sure whether he intends on still releasing the album or scrapping it all together.Delaying the album inevitably would not be an unprecedented move for West take, for instance, Turbo Grafx 16, a record he\u0026nbsppromised to release in the summer of 2016. The album never materialised, with fans having to wait until summer 2018 for West’s\u0026nbspThe Life of Pablo follow-up –\u0026nbspthe seven-track album ye.However, Turbo Grafx 16 never had an exact release date, unlike Yandhi which also has an album cover – a clear MiniDisk with purple tape on it, reminicent of the 2013 album cover for Yeezus. Fans\u0026nbspand music critics have speculated that West has delayed the album so it doesn\u0027t\u0026nbspcompete with Lil Wayne’s new record\u0026nbspTha Carter V, although a Tweet from West contested\u0026nbspthis.The Independent has reached out to West’s representatives in a hope of getting a new release date.What have we heard of Yandhi so far?Whether any previously released tracks will actually appear on the album remains to be seen. However, West has released a couple of\u0026nbsptracks over the last few weeks, including the aforementioned Lil Pump collaboration “I Love It” and the track “XTCY”.During his Saturday Night Live appearance he also performed “We Got Love” with Teyana Taylor, a track initially meant for her album K.T.S.E,\u0026nbspwhich was produced by West and released earlier this year.There’s also a snippet of a track available on Instagram. The nearly minute-long clip came alongside a message reading: “Yandhi is releasing this Saturday”.Who will feature on Yandhi?A variety of other artists are rumoured to appear on the record, including regular collaborators Kid Cudi, 070 Shake, Ty Dolla Sign and Young Thug.Perhaps the most controversial collaborators expected to appear on the record include\u0026nbsp6ix9ine and XXXTenacion, who West says recorded vocals before his untimely death earlier this year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

So it\u0027s possible that you might spot part of the Orionids\u0026nbspany time from now until 7 November.Rare electric blue clouds captured on film by NasaAnd while 21 October marks the peak of the show, the Moon might mean you\u0027re more likely to see them the week before. Around the middle of the month, it will get out of the way in the sky and make it easier for the Orionids\u0026nbspto shine through.At their peak, the Orionids could see as many as 20 of the meteors streaking across the sky. That makes it a relatively muted meteor shower compared with some of the other annual displays, but it still should be visible for the ground.And what they might lack in quantity they can make up for in quantity: the Orionids are known in particular for the brilliance of some of their lights, making them especially easy to spot.As ever, astronomers recommend heading out to somewhere with relatively little light pollution so that the night sky is more visible. Find somewhere dark and allow your eyes to adjust before looking up into the sky – wherever you\u0027d like, and with no special equipment needed at all.In keeping with their name, the meteor shower\u0026nbspwill be most visible from famous constellation of\u0026nbspOrion. But in practise, you can look just about wherever you want – and some experts recommend looking up with friends, so that you can survey the entire sky at once.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The company offered no further details.\u0026nbspThe discount sports giant paid £90m for the troubled high street group, picking up all its UK stores, branding and stock. Mr Ashley said he planned to keep 80 per cent of House of Fraser outlets open, and outlined ambitions to turn the brand into the “Harrods of the high street”.However, last month it emerged that stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon were set to shut, with Mr Ashley blaming “greedy landlords”\u0026nbspfor “refusing to be reasonable”. The retail tycoon, who also owns Newcastle United, has come under fire from property groups for his approach to rent negotiations with landlords. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: “What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords – a two-party process – where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can’t cry ‘unfair’ in the media when it doesn’t get what it wants.”House of Fraser stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon face closureSports Direct should hug House of Fraser customers even if it’s priceyHouse of Fraser customers’ anger as gift cards no longer validMr Ashley has also faced criticism for his failure to address House of Fraser customers’ concerns, after\u0026nbspall online orders were cancelled and gift cards were made invalid. Meanwhile, a number of brands have been left out of pocket following the sale of House of Fraser, after administrators EY revealed that suppliers including Gucci, Prada and Ralph Lauren, would not be paid money owed to them, with some amounts running to millions of pounds. Mike Saul, Mulberry founder,\u0026nbspwarned that luxury brands would “think very hard” about continuing to deal with House of Fraser under its new ownership.

Someone should have told them beforehand.”The EU leader’s comments come after a UK government report published in September warned flights could be disrupted in the case of a no-deal, since\u0026nbspEU-issued aviation licences would not be valid.Airlines would have to seek inidual permissions from the bloc’s 27 states to operate in those states.Ministers had previously\u0026nbspexpressed\u0026nbspdoubt on\u0026nbspthe prospect of planes being grounded if there is a no-deal Brexit, with transport secretary Chris Grayling saying in September last year:\u0026nbsp“Flights will carry on. Does anybody seriously think the Spanish government, which would see hotel bookings collapse in 2019, is going to intervene to stop planes flying? Of course, they’re not.”At the meeting in Germany, Mr Juncker\u0026nbspsaid: “What I really regret in the context of Brexit is that there was no real Brexit campaign in terms of actual information in the United Kingdom.“The people are finding out now – including British ministers and ministers on the continent – how many questions it poses, all the things we need to resolve.”He continued: “I ask myself what is going to happen to the 250,000 dogs and cats who leave the European continent each year.“Right now they just pass through the customs, all these dogs and cats coming to mainland Europe each year.“There are lots of people in Europe who just want people and animals to just cross borders, but I think we are going to have a four-day quarantine.“If you want to go to Brittany for eight days for holidays, then maybe you need to leave the dog or cat at home, or maybe you will stay home altogether.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson speaking at the Conservative Party annual conference at the International Convention Centre in BirminghamProtestors set off on an anti-Brexit march, organised by the \u0027Best For Britain\u0027 campaign group, in central Birmingham Royal Navy Commander, Nathan Gray lands his F-35B onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.Headteachers from across England and Wales hold signs in Parliament Square, London, as they prepare to march on Downing Street to demand extra money for schoolsFormer leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson (C) arrives at the Old Bailey Courthouse in London, Britain, 27 September 2018.

London building’s history, rooted in the poverty of the Victorian era, is repeating itselfClick to followThe IndependentThe early residents of Toynbee Hall, with Rev Samuel Barnett sitting to the right of his wife HenriettaIt stands where gastropubs now jostle beside the old East End of Petticoat Lane market, where streets are overshadowed by the gleaming towers of the modern City of London.\u0026nbspAmid such bustle, it is easy to overlook the lower rise, altogether more modest Toynbee Hall, and still easier to miss its significance.\u0026nbspYet this is the place that provided formative experiences for two key architects of the welfare state, William Beveridge and Clement Attlee. \u0026nbspThis is the place that can claim a pivotal role in the creation of social justice initiatives such as\u0026nbspthe Child Poverty Action Group.\u0026nbspIt is where the Poor Man’s Lawyer scheme started in 1898, and where free legal advice is still offered today – along with debt counselling, investigation of social problems and many other community services.More than a century after Toynbee Hall opened in 1884, it remains a place of pilgrimage for researchers and innovators the world over, seeking out the institution where so much began, and where so much is still being done.\u0026nbspAnd now, after a £17m restoration and redevelopment, chief executive Jim Minton is determined the reopening of the Grade II listed building should be marked by an exhibition showcasing Toynbee Hall’s history as a “powerhouse for social change”\u0026nbspand suggesting what it could do in the future.“So much did happen here and so much has been inspired by here,” he says.\u0026nbsp“This is a great moment to open the place back up again, to show the community what they have achieved and to say, ‘Let’s achieve even more in the future’.\u0026nbspBecause the problems have not gone away”20th century (Toynbee Hall Archives)There is, of course, a certain irony in that last point.Toynbee Hall was created to help lift the East End out of poverty but continues to confront\u0026nbspthe same issues of low incomes, high debt and poor housing that affected the area in 1884 – with contemporary twists.Since the\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspvote,\u0026nbspsays Minton, “our free legal advice service has started dealing with questions from people from other parts of Europe who have heard something, or been told something by their employer.”While in the 1880s the head of Toynbee Hall described casual labour – the system that saw men massing outside dockyard gates hoping to be picked for a day’s work – as “the hardest problem of east London”, there seems something of a modern echo when\u0026nbspMinton notes: “Over the past 10\u0026nbspyears, we have seen a significant change towards in-work poverty, among people in insecure employment, or on zero-hours contracts.”And yet, when Toynbee Hall opened in the 1880s, it did so during a decade that was supposed to herald a new and better beginning.\u0026nbsp“It was the end of an epoch,” recalled Winston Churchill.\u0026nbsp“The great victories had been won.\u0026nbspSlaves were free.\u0026nbspConscience was free.\u0026nbspTrade was free.\u0026nbspBut hunger and squalor were also free and the people demanded something more than liberty.”Minton\u0026nbspsees parallels today with 1818: low income, high debt, and poor housing\u0026nbsp(Toynbee Hall)In 1883, Reverend Andrew Mearns\u0026nbspwould shock middle-class Victorians with\u0026nbspThe Bitter Cry of Outcast London, his pamphlet exposing the horrors within the “rotting and reeking tenement houses” of London’s “great dark region of poverty, misery and immorality”.In 1888,\u0026nbspJack the Ripper would add fresh horror with his Whitechapel murders, virtually\u0026nbspon Toynbee Hall’s doorstep.\u0026nbspAnd in the\u0026nbspparish of St Jude’s – occupied despite the\u0026nbspbishop’s warning that it was “perhaps the worst district in London” – Reverend Samuel Barnett and his wife Henrietta were\u0026nbspwell-placed to separate grim reality from lurid sensationalism.The reality was plenty bad enough.\u0026nbspIt featured whole families living in a single room, whole neighbourhoods sharing a single lavatory, with sewers running down the middle of streets.\u0026nbspAnd yet the casual labourer was often paying more in rent per cubic foot than the rich of South Kensington.\u0026nbspThe precariousness of his income meant landlords felt justified in charging higher rents to cover themselves against inability to pay or moonlight flits – an early example, perhaps, of what is now known as the “poverty premium”.In 1883 Rev\u0026nbspBarnett was able to return to his old university to speak at the Oxford Union, and to win by unanimous vote the motion that “the condition of the poor in our large towns is a national disgrace”.\u0026nbspAnd he found a receptive audience when, in November 1883, he came “as a prophet”\u0026nbspto talk to a small group of graduates at St John’s College, Oxford, urging them, as one listener recalled, to “share the life of that dim and strange other world of east London”.For the Barnetts, this “university settlement”, proposed eight months after Karl Marx’s death, would help show the people demanding something more than liberty that they did not need to go as far as revolution.“The poor,” Rev Barnett\u0026nbspwrote in 1895, “think progress is to be won by revolution.”\u0026nbsp But\u0026nbsphe believed\u0026nbspprojects such as\u0026nbspToynbee Hall could help preach “the good news of a unity greater than rich or poor … Humanity will help the poor see the rich as their brothers, and God as their father.”Gustave ​Doré’s\u0026nbspimage of the slums of Victorian London may have been sensationalised for a middle-class audience but the reality was\u0026nbspbad enough (Alamy)Rev Barnett and the\u0026nbspforceful, equally accomplished Henrietta\u0026nbsphoped the young Oxford men would do in the city something akin to what the gentry was supposed to do in the countryside: befriending the poor and showing them how to lead better, fuller lives.\u0026nbspThe Barnetts’ vision, however, also contained large doses of humility.Before devising any bright ideas of their own, the Oxford men were supposed to learn from the poor among whom they were going to live.\u0026nbsp“The needs of east London are often urged,” Rev Barnett told them, “but they are little understood.\u0026nbspHe who has, even for a month, shared the life of the poor can never rest again in his old thoughts.”And so began the building, in the heart of the East End, of something resembling an Oxbridge college.\u0026nbspNamed Toynbee Hall, after the Barnetts’ recently deceased kindred spirit Arnold Toynbee, the Oxford historian credited with coining the term “the Industrial Revolution”,\u0026nbspit opened its doors for the first time in 1884.\u0026nbspRev Barnett was the first warden.\u0026nbspThe volunteer residents\u0026nbspdined in a hall adorned with the crests of their old Oxbridge colleges.\u0026nbspThey were soon offering help, solidarity and a rather mind-boggling array of activities to the East End.In one of the most definitive accounts of the early years of Toynbee Hall, Professor Emily Abel described how East End errand boy Ernest Baker found himself assisting in the running of the Toynbee Hall Elizabethan Literary Society.The Natural History Society broadened East Enders’ horizons by taking them into the countryside, and under the tutelage of some of the more vigorous volunteer residents, the Toynbee Travellers’ Club introduced the London poor to the joys of mountain climbing in the Swiss Alps.As Prof Abel noted, Toynbee Hall’s early residents did not always avoid being clumsily patronising –\u0026nbspone suggested the Shakespeare Club could counteract east Londoners’ “inability to amuse themselves rationally”.Created with

is at workA nurse takes blood from a patientInpatient Donald Ritson lies in bed in Ward 24 in Milton Keynes University HospitalAmong those present was a shabbily dressed character who said his name was Richter.\u0026nbspIn broken English, he berated Morley for supporting the imperialist foreign policy of Britain and other “capitalist nations”.“Go down to Limehouse or Shadwell and see how the people live,” said Richter.\u0026nbsp“Their slums, impoverishment, degradation and prostitution!\u0026nbsp That’s where your foreign policy should lie.\u0026nbspThey are the victims of your capitalist organisation which is just as powerful and cruel as the force of arms.”Morley and others politely begged to differ –\u0026nbspso politely that Richter was invited back to Toynbee Hall for tea a few days later.William Bowman, a Toynbee Hall resident who was present at the tea, recalled how Richter, “who seemed hungry”, tucked into the cakes and was particularly fascinated by the buttered muffins, which he had never tried before.But he wouldn’t budge from his belief in violent revolution.“History has shown,” he told the Toynbee Hall residents between mouthfuls of cake and muffins, “that no great change has been brought about without the shedding of blood and revolution.”Eventually he declared: “I have enjoyed this talk, but now my time is up.\u0026nbspI must go to visit my friends in Limehouse.”Richter\u0026nbspshook hands with the assembled company and departed.\u0026nbspOnly much later did the Toynbee Hall residents realise that they had in fact been having tea with the exiled Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin.In a gentler way, some of the stances taken by Toynbee Hall and its residents have been, if not revolutionary, then at least profoundly challenging to conventional wisdom.\u0026nbspEven as the hall opened, the Barnetts were\u0026nbspin the process of parting ways with the Charity Organisation Society (COS), which had started in 1869 as the Society for Organising Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicity.Much emphasis was placed on repressing mendicity\u0026nbsp– begging.\u0026nbspRather as some now rail against a perceived “benefits culture”, the social reformer Octavia Hill, a driving force in the COS, firmly believed that indiscriminate alms-giving “degraded” the poor, making them happy to rely on charity and unable or unwilling to support themselves through hard work.In a possible echo of the current debates around fit-to-work benefits tests, it was believed that extensive scrutiny of applications for “relief” was needed to distinguish the virtuous but luckless worker from the “clever pauper”.“The main tone of action,” maintained Hill, “must be severe.\u0026nbspThere is much of rebuke and repression needed, although a deep and silent undercurrent of pity may flow beneath.”In the eyes of the Fabian Beatrice Webb, the Barnetts “discovered that there was a deeper evil than unrestrained charity, namely unrestricted and unregulated capitalism and landlordism.”And so in 1888 the matchgirls of the East End found allies in Toynbee Hall when they went on strike, protesting against pitiful wages and factory conditions that included white phosphorous fumes destroying jawbones, giving\u0026nbspmatch-makers “phossy-jaw”.In an early example of Toynbee Hall residents learning from their East End neighbours, a group of them made their own investigations, then helped shape public opinion with letters to The Times detailing the matchgirls’ “deplorable conditions” and below-subsistence wages.\u0026nbspAfter its first warden Samuel Barnett died in 1913, it could be said that Toynbee Hall rose to other challenges.\u0026nbspOn Sunday 4 October\u0026nbsp1936 Oswald Mosley tried to march his uniformed blackshirts through the East End.\u0026nbspJewish groups, trade unionists and leftwingers mobilised to block the fascists’ path with barricades and cries of “They shall not pass!”When the police tried to clear a route for the British Union of Fascists, the “Battle of Cable Street” began.\u0026nbspThe fascists did not pass.\u0026nbspDefeated by the dogged East Enders, police commissioner Sir Philip Game was forced to tell Mosley to march west, out of the area.A week later, however, in what became known as the Mile End Pogrom, about 200 fascists smashed up Jewish shops and houses in the Mile End Road, even throwing a young child and elderly Jewish man through a window.Toynbee Hall warden Jimmy Mallon was appalled.\u0026nbspHe called a meeting at Toynbee Hall that led to the creation of a Council of Citizens of East London, which then issued a notice to be displayed in shops and workplaces.\u0026nbsp“Citizens of East London,” the notice warned.\u0026nbsp “Forces are at work to destroy the common sense and toleration and good humour on which we pride ourselves.\u0026nbspWe must work against these forces.\u0026nbspBoycott provocative demonstrations.\u0026nbspMaintain calm and good temper.\u0026nbspStand together for fair play.”Meanwhile, Jimmy Mallon joined a delegation that persuaded the government of the need for what became the Public Order Act 1936.It banned the wearing of uniforms for political purposes, as well as enhancing police powers to deal with marches.Profumo found redemption at Toynbee Hall, rising from dishwasher to chairman (Toynbee Hall Archives)Such achievements are, perhaps, one answer to the sour aside of East Ender and future Labour leader George Lansbury, who in 1928 wrote that Toynbee Hall was used as a stepping stone by ambitious young careerists who would eventually claim that: “The interests of the poor were best served by leaving east London to stew in its own juice while they became members of parliament, cabinet ministers, civil servants.”Had he lived long enough, Lansbury might have added that Toynbee Hall was also used by at least one ex-cabinet minister to forge a new, post-scandal career.It is often recalled that in 1963, after being caught lying to parliament about his affair with Christine Keeler, John Profumo began a new career washing dishes at Toynbee Hall, rising to become chairman in 1982 and “learning humility” in the process.\u0026nbspBut it is often forgotten how much Profumo achieved at Toynbee Hall.\u0026nbspHe raised funds, helped ease overcrowding through involvement in the Toynbee Housing Association, and backed potentially controversial schemes like the “Grendon outpost”, providing aftercare for former psychiatric-prison inmates.In what could have been another riposte to George Lansbury, William Beveridge freely acknowledged that his coming to Toynbee Hall, aged 24, in 1903 had been the stepping stone to other things.\u0026nbspBut in the same breath, he said that none of his later achievements would have been possible without the “special knowledge … gained in Whitechapel”.During his two years at Toynbee Hall, Beveridge was able, he later recalled, “to learn about the main economic problem of those days, not from books, but by interviewing unemployed applicants for relief”.And Beveridge’s recommendations were implemented by the post-war government of fellow Toynbee alumnus Clement Attlee, who spent a year as the hall’s secretary in 1910.\u0026nbspAttlee came to Toynbee Hall with prior experience of the East End, having been the manager of Stepney Boys’ Club and an assistant to Beatrice Webb.In his 1920 book Social Worker, the Oxford-educated former public schoolboy revealed some of the lessons the East End had taught him.I met a small boy in the street one day.Attlee (first left) at Toynbee Hall in 1910 (Courtesy of Anne, Countess Attlee)Echoing the Barnetts’\u0026nbspgrowing distaste for the COS, while seemingly anticipating some of the thinking behind – and modern arguments about – the welfare state, Attlee inveighed against\u0026nbsp“the suggestion that those in need of relief should be passed through a sort of sieve”“They will spend much time finding ways in which small wages may be made to go a long way, without considering whether those wages should not be raised, or recognising that the claim to a share in the better things of life which is expressed in the purchase of luxuries is a more hopeful thing than submission to low wages.”In the newly restored Toynbee Hall, Jim Minton expresses pride in the connection to men like Attlee and Beveridge. But he is careful to temper such pride with a recognition of the work still to be done.\u0026nbspDespite 134 years of “progress”, despite the wealth represented by those gleaming City of London towers, the East End – still – contains two of the three worst-rated UK parliamentary constituencies for child poverty.\u0026nbspAnd in 2015, the last time such official statistics were compiled, the east London boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham were ranked the worst local authority areas in the country for income-deprivation among older people.Child food poverty ‘sparks return of Victorian scourges’Nearly half of all children in London and Birmingham ‘live in poverty’Government must tackle ‘slum’ conditions faced by private rentersMy forefather’s life in Manchester’s slumsTower Hamlets, Toynbee Hall’s local borough, has about 2,000 homeless families in temporary accommodation and in 2015 just over a quarter of its population was found to be living in income deprivation.“We are talking every day to people who have financial problems,” says\u0026nbspMinton.\u0026nbsp“There are still huge amounts of poverty in east London.“The learning process that Attlee and Beveridge and hundreds of other less famous people would have gone through at Toynbee Hall,” says Minton, “would have been about challenging, and saying: ‘This is unacceptable.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening, and what can we do about it?’”“That,” he declares, “is very much the spirit we want to keep alive.”\u0026nbsp‘Toynbee Hall: A Powerhouse for Social Change’ is open Monday-Friday and on the third weekend of every month at Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London, E1 6LSBattle of Cable StreetShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

There has been a lot of misinterpretation, holding it up as a sacrosanct piece of legislation.”The DUP campaigned against the Good Friday Agreement\u0026nbspin 1998, when it was approved by referenda on both sides of the border.The former first minister also endorsed the spirit and belief in Mr Johnson\u0027s Brexit plans, ahead of the ex-foreign secretary\u0027s eagerly-anticipated speech to conference, which is being interpreted by many\u0026nbspas a leadership bid.We won\u0027t compromise to rescue the Tory party, Verhofstadt warnsLive: Boris Johnson rally to dominate Conservative conferenceThree Tory ministers back new Brexit vote, conference toldJohnson\u0027s plans could collapse government after DUP reject themMs Foster said: “I think people want that hope, they want to be positive. I think the reason why so many people are turned off by Brexit is because they are being fed a diet of negativity - whether it’s infighting, Brussels, being disrespected by people over there.“We haven’t been able to talk about the aspirations for the nation, we’ve spent so much time arguing about what’s happened, is it going to be a disaster for Ireland in inverted commas...instead of actually focusing on what we can achieve in the UK with the Brexit negotiations.“What we want to see, and I’m not making a comparison between Boris and the Prime Minister, is belief. We want to see that spirit.”Asked if she would work with Mr Johnson, Ms Foster\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“Our confidence arrangement is with the Conservative Party. It was signed by the two chief whips. It is a party-to-party agreement.“Whoever leads the Conservative Party we will work with as it’s in the national interest. The reason we signed the agreement was to ensure Brexit.”It will come as a boost to Mr Johnson, after the party\u0027s Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson initially described his suggestion of a Canada-style trade deal as too vague.In a separate interview with Bloomberg TV, Ms Foster torpedoed the prime minister\u0027s plan for regulatory checks in an attempt to resolve the Irish border wrangle.Asked if her party could accept such\u0026nbspchecks, she said: “No and it’s been very clear all along that has been our one red line - that we cannot have either a customs border down the Irish Sea or a regulatory border because that would make us separate from the rest of the United Kingdom and that doesn’t work from a constitutional perspective and it doesn’t work from an economic perspective either.”Political opponents roundly condemned the DUP leader\u0027s comments.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

He will solve the problem by building a bridge between the UK mainland and Ireland. Mr Boris Johnson is more known for burning bridges than for building bridges!We will never undermine the principles of the European project to rescue a political party who is not even capable to find a common line on the mess of Brexit“Then there’s Mr Rees-Mogg who’s saying ‘yeah, I have the proposals for the future of Brexit, ordinary citizens and their savings can be secure after Brexit!’ and in the meantime he’s opening for himself an investment fund in Ireland, to transfer his money to Ireland.”He added: “Jeremy Hunt, who is comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union. But in his case that is not so abnormal: he has once even confused Japan with China. This is not the first time this is happening.\u0026nbsp“The previous time he was insulting his wife, but this time it’s something far more different: he’s insulting not us, but millions of ordinary citizens who have lived under Soviet rule for so long. That is in fact a point on which he has to apologise, I think, because we cannot take it as such a thing he said.”Other senior Brussels politicians also used the debate to tear into senior Conservatives. Manfred Weber, leader of the centre-right European People’s Party and an ally of Angela Merkel, told MEPs that British politicians would have to start taking responsibility for their mistakes.“Brexit means leaving the European Union and this means losing the advantages of this Union. That is the simple principle behind this,” Mr Weber said.“The big challenge for the politicians in Great Britain like Hunt and Johnson is probably that after March next year they have to take over responsibility.\u0026nbsp“For the first time they have to explain to people what they did, what are the mistakes of their political engagement, and they can’t blame Brussels anymore for what is happening in Britain. That is a big change for them.”Mr Weber, a likely candidate to be the next president of the European Commission, also called for “ring-fenced” protections for EU citizens living in Britain and British citizens living in the EU in the event of a no-deal.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

public to decide what they want us to do next\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsHeidi Allen has become the latest Conservative MP to back a Final Say Brexit referendum, arguing there is now “no alternative”.The prominent backbencher said that, with the Chequers proposals “dead” and the threat to jobs from crashing out of the EU without a deal, the decision had to be thrown back to the public.Ms Allen blamed Boris Johnson and other Tory right-wingers for killing off Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which now had no chance of approval at Westminster – even if it can be revived in Brussels.Clark insists ‘we need to have a Brexit deal’, contradicting May“They have behaved unacceptably through this and have completely tied her hands,” she said. “It is they who have made Chequers dead.”She then added: “That being the case, then I think that it is the end of the road, which is very disappointing and for me leaves us with no alternative.“Should we come to that and no deal ... then we need to go back to the public to decide what they want us to do next.”Crucially, Ms Allen said the option of staying in the EU under existing terms would have to be on the ballot paper.She told BBC Radio 4 that she would still support in principle an “11th hour” deal hammered out by the prime minister but that it was now clear many in her party would not.Her comments came as the Conservative faithful gather in Birmingham for the party’s annual conference and after Mr Johnson’s latest broadside against the prime minister’s negotiating stance.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s

It’s also a way of crashing the economy\u0027Click to followIndy PoliticsBusiness minister Claire Perry has broken ranks to warn that a no-deal Brexit would be “catastrophic” and “a way of crashing the economy”.Theresa May and other cabinet ministers have insisted the UK can prosper even if it crashes out of the EU without an agreement – insisting that remains an option.But Ms Perry said: “No deal is a recipe for a catastrophic series of consequences.“It’s also a way of crashing the economy and of doing great damage to our most productive industries.”We won\u0027t compromise to rescue the Tory party, Verhofstadt warnsSpeaking to Sky News, Ms Perry agreed the UK had to be ready for the danger of crashing out, saying: “We have to be prepared for it and we are preparing for it.”Nevertheless, her warning undermines the prime minister’s determination to claim the UK is seriously contemplating a no-deal – something widely seen as a bluff on the continent.They also mark the very different approach of the business department, headed by Greg Clark, who – at the weekend – insisted a Brexit agreement is essential.The comments are a far cry from Ms May’s continued insistence, repeated after the EU threw out her Chequers plan, that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.Created with Sketch.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit deal Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchOther senior ministers, led by Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, and Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, have argued Britain could “thrive” after crashing out, after initial disruption.Ms Perry was a strong Remain supporter, who hit the headlines in February 2017, when she branded hard Brexit supporters in the Tory party “like jihadis”.Arlene Foster says Good Friday Agreement is not \u0027sacrosanct\u0027Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionClaims of Tory turf war amid \u0027shambolic\u0027 release of migration plan Big companies will get huge tax cuts after no-deal Brexit, Raab saysShe said the atmosphere of the Brexit debate “sometimes borders on the hysterical”, but returned to government a few months later nonetheless.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet -

Boris Johnson will draw a big crowd for his “Chuck Chequers” rally.But there is a bigger danger waiting in the wings for the Tories: They simply don’t have a domestic agenda big enough for the moment.Labour has, over the past few days, set out its vision for Britain. It is, in places, scary. But give Jeremy Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this, it is undoubtedly clear and bold. As one Cabinet minister says, half admiringly:  “They’re hungry.”The Tories need to show  they have a better plan, one that will deal with people’s concerns— and they don’t have any time to waste. As one minister warns: “I’m just really terried. People don’t realise what a big deal this is.”The Tory Party’s problem is that it isn’t giving the country a vision of where it wants to take it. One former party leader has taken to lamenting that the Tories have “lost the narrative”.At conference last year, Theresa May declared that it was her mission to solve the housing crisis, to restore the British dream of home ownership for the many.But in the past  months, the Government has made far too little progress on this. Yes, some sensible steps have been taken. But the policies that will really solve this crisis, proper planning reform and a massive, Government-led housebuilding programme, haven’t happened.The result of all this: Jeremy Corbyn gets closer to power. As this newspaper revealed yesterday, Labour is now ahead in the seats that decide general elections thanks to its massive lead among renters.The likelihood of someone in their late twenties or early thirties on an average salary owning their own home has halved in the past  years.This is an electoral time bomb for the Tories. They can’t expect those without capital, or any prospect of getting it, to be capitalists.By the time of the next election, the Tories need to show people that their lives are getting better AND explain the damage  Corbyn would do to the country.One minister points the finger of blame at Number  for the Tory predicament. “A fish rots from the head down,” he tells me. But the Cabinet can’t escape its share of the blame, either.With a few exceptions, min­isters aren’t doing enough to take on Labour’s arguments. As one former Secretary of State fumed to me during Labour conference: “It’s outrageous. Where are the Cabinet ”If the Tories get Brexit wrong, it could cost them the next election. But eventhey get a decent deal, it won’t guarantee them victory. For the public will vote on domestic issues — whether the housing crisis is solved, the state of the health service and what is going on with schools.Corbyn has simple answers to all these questions: They might be wrong, but they are answers. The Tories now need to show the country  they have answers too.AT last, some positivity and optimism about this country’s post-Brexit future from the Government.I can reveal  it is planning a major new festival celebrating the UK for . The aim is for this festival to tell the world a story about Britain as we leave the EU and take charge of our own future. It is meant to coincide with the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee and the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham that year.Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright,  who is pushing this idea in Whitehall, has told colleagues  it will be: “Future-facing, telling a story about the UK’s unique strengths, particularly as a place to invest, as we forge a new future outside the European Union.”If the Government gets it right, this festival could be a great statement about the open, dynamic country that Britain is going to be after Brexit. It should emphasise how this country is going out into the world after leaving the EU, not pulling up the drawbridge.The aim should be to put on something that stands comparison with the great post-war Festival of Britain in  or even the Great Exhibition of , which showcased Victorian Britain’s global reach and technological edge.One Secretary of State, who is backing the idea, tells me: “People just want something really positive.”But cynics might note that there is an advantage for the Tories in a feel-good festival in an election year.But I understand he will  have a harsh message for the Westminster politicians in attendance. He will  tell them to stop bickering and positioning and get on with delivering for the country.Mr Street will say that outside the Westminster bubble, the public just want politicians to get on with things, rather than constantly jostling for position.What makes his  speech so interesting is that he is a Downing Street favourite. Indeed, I understand  some of those close to Theresa May are pushing for a similar tone in her speech.They believe  her post-Salzburg speech went down so well with the public not just because she was standing up to the EU but because she was taking charge and being that “bloody dficult woman”. They think she should use her speech to tell members  they won’t get everything  they want from the Brexit talks, but that she will get the best deal for Britain.Others, though, are wary of this approach. One Cabinet minister cautions that after last year, May should play it safe as “you can’t have two bad years  in a row”.THE Government has rightly guaranteed that the three million EU citizens living in Britain will be able to stay in the event of no deal.This is sensible. These citizens contribute a lot to this country, and help keep our economy and our public services moving.But it is also right that the Government is now discussing what the rules will be for deporting EU citizens who commit crimes after Brexit in a no-deal scenario.The details have not yet been decided and, as one government source puts it: “No one wants people deported for getting a parking ticket.”But it is right that those who are convicted of a signicant offence are removed.• SPOT the leadership bid will be one of the games  the Tories play in Birmingham.Any Cabinet minister who starts talking about their childhood will be accused of planning a run for the top job.  This leaves ministers walking a tightrope as they prepare their speeches. Some are dealing with this challenge by handing their time  to others.Penny Mordaunt, the Aid Secretary, is simply introducing a series of “British heroes” who do development work.But one of those involved in conference planning suspects that even this is about leadership as Mordaunt “doesn’t want to spend  minutes defending the aid budget to a hall of Tory activists”.James Forsyth is political editor of The Spectator.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

What’s great about the first episode is that the contestants, all of whom talk the talk about how fantastic they are, are thrown into the deep end with a task that’s designed to test their logic.They are sent on what is a bit like a treasure hunt, in Malta, armed only with a map and some euros.This task is all about logistics, negotiation and identying, and let’s say it doesn’t end well.It turns out that, unfortunately, logic is not something all the contestants are in possession of.During this series we will travel all over the country, including to Glasgow to sell emerging artists’ work to the unsuspecting public.When I say that task was more challenging than ever, I’m referring partly to the challenge of actually getting to Glasgow because it was during the storms. Remember them Turbulence was an under-statement. On the flight there, I was gritting my teeth and grabbing on to Claude like there was no tomorrow.One thing I love about the show is that there are equal numbers of men and women, and they are on a level playing field.Let’s face it, the same cannot be said out there in the “real” world.One thing I’ve been reflecting on over the course of my time on The Apprentice is how much things have changed for women in business since I started out.When I was having my kids  years ago, the very notion of “work-le balance” didn’t exist. But I’m pleased to say that working women aren’t trying to Have It All any more, and the days are gone when women feel the need to keep quiet about having kids at work.Women are now more able to demand flexible working and feel entitled to have time off for, say, ante-natal classes.More “mumpreneurs” are starting their own businesses. Still, you rarely catch working mothers using childcare as a reason for being absent from work — while men, I’ve noticed, almost get points for doing so.And it is still the case that working mothers and women working flexibly are less likely to be promoted.So I don’t quite agree with Ann Widdecombe, the former Tory MP, who wrote this week that women today have “never had it so good” yet still “whinge” about inequality.Because while it might be true that things have changed for the better, most CEOs are still male.Women might never have had it so good but it’s still not good enough — and it’s not “whingeing” to point that out.HONESTLY, watching Jeremy Corbyn forgetting Labour’s six tests for a Brexit deal, when interviewed by the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, was like watching a hapless buffoon.No wonder he got two Es at A-level.This is the leader of the party that makes it up as it goes along – buying votes, promising everyone everything . . . and delivering absoutely nothing.As Margaret Thatcher said, The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.HERE, The Apprentice star Karren picks out some highlights to look forward to during the show’s new season . . .Wyatt said: “Bill Cosby is doing great . . . Mr Cosby knows that God is watching over him . . . he knows that these are lies.“They persecuted Jesus and look what happened . . .  I’m not saying Mr Cosby is Jesus, but we know what this country has done to black men for centuries.”Just to be clear, Cosby’s conviction has nothing to do with race.The man is accused of rape and drug-facilitated sexual assault, by an astonishing  women . . . of all races and ages including some as young as .He has finally been put in prison and his victims have justice. He is a vile rapist, a violent sexual predator.His sentence is based on his crimes, not his colour.Unlike Cosby – a “disgusting sexual deviant” according to one of his victims – Jesus was innocent of the crimes laid against him.Cosby, meanwhile, has admitted to giving sedatives to young women in order to have sex with them.In short, Cosby admits his crimes, the jury find him guilty and the judge sentences him.Attempts to make this out as a racial issue are simply ridiculous.I KNOW it’s hard for men to face up to losing their hair, but someone needs to tell David Beckham that by far the best approach when it happens is . . . acceptance.But, judging from the photos of him looking a bit like a smiling Brillo pad this week that is not the route he is taking.David,you are reading this, you are a handsome man and no one caresyou have a thick head of hair or not – please don’t turn into Shane Warne.I guess the reality star has yet to realise no one is forcing her to go out.She just needs to learn the power of saying no.In the past, I had a dreadful habit of saying yes to an engagement when I meant no, then spent days trying to think of ways to get out of it.I completely changed my le when I decided to simply things by saying yes to an invitation when I wanted to go – and no when I didn’t.IT’S hard to believe not only that West Midlands Police are allowing “thrill-seekers” to spend Halloween in a cell used by serial murderer Fred West – but that they are charging them £ to do so.Offering this “spooky ghost hunt” at the notorious Steelhouse Lane cells in Birmingham is in very poor taste – so disrespectful of West’s victims, including his daughter who is a surviving casualty of his and is clearly still suffering every day.No doubt the relatives of those West murdered still suffer every day, too.So the fact that a stay in his old prison cell is being offered as Halloween entertainment is positively ghoulish.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and quipped: “You’ve put the jinx on me!”And in a Sunday Times interview, Mrs May joked that she will take a “sackful” of cough sweets on stage with her for the speech.At last year’s event, Philip Hammond ended up handing her a pack of lozenges as she struggled on stage.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis suggested the party had taken efforts to secure the stage this year so that it doesnt start falling apart again.He told the BBC: We are checking the stage and making sure its a good stage for people to be able to view, enjoy and have a really good conference while they are in the hall.Mrs May is hoping to use the party gathering in Birmingham to see off threats to her leadership from the likes of Boris Johnson."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT0004382318851.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may chequers brexit conservative conference boris johsnon","story":"As the Tory conference started in Birmingham yesterday, the PM gave angry delegates hope by hinting there was “flexibility”.Meanwhile, Tories on all sides of the Brexit debate rallied round her after Boris Johnson launched his most personal attack yet.Marking the start of the Tories’ choppy annual conference in Birmingham, the under fire party leader told BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that a free trade deal is “at the heart of Chequers”.She also refused to rule out further fudges with the EU despite being asked to five separate times.And behind closed doors, Mrs May gave angry Tory delegates hope by saying there will be “flexibility” with Chequers in the last few weeks of negotiations.During a National Convention meeting with regional party bosses, The Sun has learned that the PM also conceded for the first time that her full plan to keep to the EU’s rules on goods and collect its customs tarfs has been knocked back by EU bosses.But “aspects of it will still work”, Mrs May told them.The key concessions came as senior Tories on all sides of the Brexit ide lashed out at Boris after the former Foreign Secretary issued his most personal attack on the PM yet.The mop haired senior Tory branded her Chequers plan for a softer Brexit “deranged”, and questioned whether she really believes in exiting the EU at all.That left Mrs May being forced to insist: I do believe in Brexit.But a long list of senior party figures seized on Boris’s latest diatribe in a Sunday newspaper to accuse him of attention seeking,Former Brexit Secretary and fellow Leave campaigner David Davis attacked Boris for coming up with “good headlines not good policies”.Scots Tory leader Ruth Davidson accused Boris of hypocrisy, branding it “strange” he is attacking Mrs May’s Northern Ireland backstop pledge having previously heaped praise on her for it when he was in the Cabinet.And in the more caustic comments of all, and TV celebrity Lord Digby Jones leaped on Boris for saying f*** business’.The former business minister told the party faithful from the conference patfrom: It showed him up to be the irrelevant and offensive person he really is.The Sun can also reveal a group of Tory MPs who have formed an ‘Anyone But Boris’ campaign to frustrate any leadership bid intend to boo Mr Johnson at a conference rally he will headline on Tuesday.One Tory minister said: “Several colleagues have said they are going to give Boris a taste of their own medicine and turn up to boo him.“He won’t be very happy at the idea that some of us are getting very fed up with his antics.”The backlash came as three dferent polls also yesterday revealed Mrs May is still liked by more voters than Boris.If the election was a two way race, a BMG Research poll for HuffPost UK found % backed Jeremy Corbyn versus % who supported Boris.But in answer to the same question comparing Mrs May and Mr Corbyn, the PM came out on top by % to %.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned Brussels would stir Britain’s “Dunkirk spirit”it forced a bad deal on Mrs May.He told The : “If President Macron thinks we will come crawling back to the club in a few years’ time, it is a profound misreading of our character.”In what was seen as the first of a series of pitches at the four day conference to succeed Mrs May, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the EU to the Soviet Union yesterday for treating Britain as a prisoner it won’t allow to leave.Remainer-turned-Brexiteer Mr Hunt told the hall: “What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream  The EU was set up to protect freedom.“It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving.Mr Hunt also issued a plea for warring Tory factions to come together and end their Brexit civil war.He added: “We can only unite the countrywe are united ourselves. In Parliament. In the Government. And in the Cabinet”.Meanwhile hardline backbench Tory Brexiteers put on a concerted show of strength last night hinting they could oust the PMshe did not change her Chequers plan.Boris’s close ally Conor Burns took direct aim, warning: I say to the Prime Minister - we dont want to change you, we want you to change the policy of Chequers.And he urged her to please, please adopt a Canada style trade deal instead, suggesting the affection he held for the PM was at breaking point.And he was backed at the Brexit Central website rally by Jacob Rees Mogg, who said Chequers was “not only a dying duck in a thunderstorm, it’s the deadest dying duck in a thunderstorm.And he blasted campaigners for a so-called Peoples Vote, comparing them to Chinese communist and Libyan tyrant Gaddafi.He said: Once you put peoples in the title it is not true, it is about the elite, about those in charge and we should be very careful about that.A former Defence Minister also accused the PM of behaving like scheming Italian prince Machivelli and risked sending betrayed Tory voters into a political wilderness.Mark Francois - who served as Conservative frontbencher for  years - told The Sun the Chequers plan looks like “some Machiavellian process or series of backstairs deals” that has “sought to overturn their clearly expressed decision”.And he said the political weather meant those Brexit-loving Tory voters would be left homeless and may never vote again.A study yesterday revealed that Brexit is already costing the public purse £m a week.The Centre for European Reform’s analysis found the UK economy is already .% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum.But in an attempt at a Brexit boost, ministers announced that the UK will host a nationwide Festival of Britain  Northern Ireland in .FORMER Labour Minister Digby Jones warned pro-business Tories must unite as “Jeremy Corbyn is to wealth creation what Diane Abbott is to mathematics”.SCOTS Tory MP Ross Thomson savaged the one word conference slogan “OPPORTUNITY”, raging: “I couldn’t help thinking of the other words ‘missed’, ‘lost’, ‘wasted’ and ‘squandered’.”TRANSPORT boss Chris Grayling’s own train to Birmingham was late — but he was spotted passing the time playing FarmVille on his phone rather than working.FORMER Remainer Jeremy Hunt delighted the Leave-backing party faithful by comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and then channelling Maggie Thatcher by telling Brussels “no, no, no”.TORY Peter Bone said ex-Ukip boss Nigel Farage should be made a Lord and put in charge of Brexit, adding: “If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If was Mr Hammond’s rival offer to defeat hard-left Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn’s Socialist blueprint.Mr Hammond told the conference: “Global internet giants must contribute fairly to funding our public services. The best way to tax international companies is through international agreements.“But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop. If we cannot reach agreement, the UK will go it alone with a Digital Services Tax of its own.”The Chancellor will push ahead with the move after losing patience with the US.Despite repeated promises for global action to end the tax dodge, President Trump’s administration is still stalling on a solution as it reaps billions from the firms, with so many based on the US’s West Coast.Britain is instead now looking at Europe-wide action, as France is also keen for something to be done. The Treasury is also consulting on a second online levy, an Online Sales Tax, to force digital retailers such as Amazon to pay more tax too.But sources close to the Chancellor said he is going cold on that as he fears the giants will just pass it straight on to consumers.The Cabinet has been under heavy pressure to combat Mr Corbyn’s polished offer of Socialist solutions to angry voters’ woes during a successful Labour conference last week.Mr Hammond tackled the Labour boss head-on yesterday, by pledging to “harness the power of the market economy” instead of “a discredited ideology that will never solve real-world problems”.He insisted Tories must face up to the anger among many British workers, saying: “Too many feel they are working for the system, but the system isn’t working for them.“So our challenge is to ensure st-century capitalism delivers for those people. It will be this technological transformation, and how we manage it — not Brexit — that will define the future of our country and our party.”Mr Hammond added: “Show them that, crucially, the change that technology is driving will address their concerns, not make them worse.“If we look for a moment like the party of “no change”, then we should not be surprised that some will be tempted by the dangerous populism of our opponents.”Mr Hammond also answered the calls of big business who have been stung by PM Theresa May’s attack on excess profits and boardroom culture. Tory donor and City billionaire Michael Spencer said the party had “lost its way” on business, accusing the PM of “letting herself down”.But the Chancellor said: “Let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business. That means we listen to business.” And in a change of tone on Brexit, a more positive Mr Hammond also predicted a “deal idend” that could fund tax cuts and public service spending once a deal is reached.He also said the Treasury was keeping sufficient “fiscal firepower” to hand to deal with any economic fallout from a No-Deal Brexit.BRITAIN still lacks the confidence to intervene in foreign wars due to the disasters of Iraq and Afghanistan, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.LIZ Truss says a German airline turned her into a “radicalised” feminist when she was  years old.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the images depict hunted animals and theres detailing of animal forms. So this man knew about animals and sea creatures.

Now imagine being in the situation where more people would have turned up to see your speechyou hadn’t turned up yourself. That’s the position Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright was in this afternoon. You see, Jeremy was originally supposed to deliver his speech to Conservative Party Conference as a hologram. A projection. A digital apparition. It was the brainchild of his predecessor, Matt Hancock - now Health Secretary, and much more comfortable in the ‘Minister of Fun’ brief than Wright. You remember him. He’s the one who did Parkour.  And had his own app - called Matt Hancock - which wasn’t very good, but at the very least didn’t leak the Defence Secretary’s mobile number to literally anyone who wanted it. Before Theresa May’s last reshuffle, The Right Honourable Jeremy Wright QC was the attorney general. The government’s top lawyer.I’ve seen Wright deliver learned, competent speeches about tricky subjects like cyber security. He was quite good at it.Which made his move to Culture, where hed have to talk about sportand musiceven more baffling. But while the hologram stunt might have been infinitely better suited to Matt Hancocks talents, at least it would have given Jeremy a bit of pizazz. Wright, a curious charisma vacuum, took to the stage to tell an anecdote about his school play to a concert hall barely busier than the upper room was for the Last Supper. “When I was , I was shy and didnt much like being the centre of attention. I’ve changed,” he joked, fooling nobody. He went on: “But that year I was persuaded to take a large part in a school play. “The effect on my self-confidence, on what I felt I could do, was signicant and long-lasting. “So much so that I feel able to say to you thatI had not stood on that stage then, I would not be standing on this stage now.”  It’s hard to think that when Wright wrote those lines into his speech, he’d imagined delivering them them to a crowd which could have comfortably fit in the school hall which saw his theatrical debut. A conservative estimate - pun intended - put the size of the party faithful somewhere just south of , scattered through the four levels of Birmingham’s cavernous Symphony Hall. I genuinely just went into the hall to see how sparse the crowd was, but so empty was the auditorium I almost felt obliged to keep my seat until the end of his address to make up the numbers. It’s not just him, though he was the most pathetic example. There were plenty of seats free for Chancellor Philip Hammond’s speech. There was no compunction to turn up early for Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, or even Tory conference favourite Ruth Davidson, who gave a speech which hit all the right notes, but was never going to win a Grammy.

Local chairman reportedly heckled their leader as she defended her Chequers proposal at a behind-closed-doors meeting of the National Conservative Convention. Attendee John Stafford told the Dailyit was a wave of grumbling adding: The party leader normally gets a standing ovation... but Mrs May just walked off and that was it. This is my th party conference and Ive never seen that. Another person in the room said: There was a boo when she mentioned Chequers. It was a bit embarrassing. The humiliating claims came as a kickback went into full swing in Birmingham - with a former Brexit minister saying Mrs Mays plan are causing Brexiteer members considerable alarm. Steve Baker said the blueprint - which will see the UK share a common rulebook with Brussels on some goods exports - takes off the table all of the benefits of an independent trade and regulatory policy.  He also claimed US officials despair of Chequers as it would leave Britain as a satellite of the EU. The row erupted as Boris Johnson prepares to take the axe to Mrs Mays Chequers plan in a speech to the conference this lunchtime.  And Brexiteers are set to be enraged even further - as reports emerged Mrs May will compromise even further with the EU. The Times reported the Prime Minister is preparing a grand bargain offer to Brussels that would involve the UK staying tied to EU customs rules on goods after a transition period ends in December . If true this would bar Britain from striking global trade deals for many years.  Its reported that this temporary arrangement would have no time limit - and end only when a technological solution to the Irish border issue was found. Mrs May today admitted her husband Philip poured her a stf drink after EU chiefs told her last month that her Chequers plan will not work. She is still trapped in deadlock with the EU, with each side urging the other to budge just days before a crucial Brussels summit.  The gathering on October  to  has been billed as the moment of truth when it will become clear whether it is possible for the two sides to do a deal. But talks have become trapped over the issue of the Irish border. Mrs May says the EUs plan would drive a wedge between rules for Northern Ireland and those for the rest of the UK - essentially, a border down the Irish Sea. Chancellor Philip Hammond upped the ante last night in a drastic warning thattheres no deal, full border checks WILLbetween Northern Ireland and the Republic.  He told a fringe event at the Tory conference: The challenges around the Irish border are around the legal requirements we will havewe are not in a trade block within the European Union to operate the [World Trade Organisation] compliant border, which does require checks at the border. That’s what the WTO rules require.” European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hit back this morning - saying the EU would not compromise on key principles, and there must be agreement on the Irish borderMrs May wants a Brexit deal. We want to have a deal, he said.  Those who think a no-deal would be a better solution are not aware of the dficulties such a scenario would imply. When it comes to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we are sticking to the point of view we have expressed so many times - Ireland first. Mr Juncker also suggested British planes may not be able to land in the EUBrexit goes wrong. And he warned a four-day quarantine may be imposed on pet dogs and cats passing from the UK to continental Europe and again on theirjourney. Speaking at a public meeting in Freiburg, Germany, Mr Juncker asked: Whats going to happen to air traffic in Europeeverything goes wrong  British planes will not be able to land on the European continent. People didnt know that. Someone should have told them beforehand. The UKs current Brexit plan is based on a deal Theresa May drew up at Chequers, her country retreat, in July . At the time it was seen as a major sht to soft Brexit - prompting hard-Leaver Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson to resign. The Facilitated Customs Arrangement is a bid to solve the biggest problem of Brexit - how to stop a hard border between Northern Ireland and either the EU, or the rest of the UK. It would keep the UK closely aligned with the EU in a new free trade area for goods. Under this plan, the UK would share a common rulebook with Brussels for goods, including agricultural and food products. Britain would also collect some, but not all, customs tarfs on the EUs behalf. Parliament would technically keep the right to block future rules. But Tory Brexiteers said this olive branch would useless in practice. They forced Theresa May to amend the plan to say the EU should collects tarfs on the UKs behalf. Mrs May insisted this didnt scupper her plan. But EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier disagreed, and has continued to suggest there will be a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Remainers and Labour have also opposed the Chequers plan, saying it leaves Britain half-in-half-out of the EU in the worst of all worlds.With a November deadline to agree a deal with the EU looming, and the plan facing a vote in Parliament after that, the UK is now ramping up plans to leave in March  with no deal."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa finally unveils brexit immigration","story":"NewsTheresa May finally unveils Brexit immigration plans scant first details to end free movement once and for allThe Prime Ministers finally giving some ground but her plan has scant details - and still faces being picked apart by BrusselsShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsBut the Prime Ministers plan has scant details - and still faces being picked apart by Brussels \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTheresa May today finally unveils the first details of Britains Brexit immigration system as she claimed it will end free movement once and for all. Anyone earning below a certain salary faces being barred from the country - while EU workers will be treated in the same way as those from the rest of the world, the Tory leader claims. High-skilled workers who want to live and work in Britain will be given priority while low skilled immigration will be curbed, Tory chiefs say. And tourists and business visitors making short trips to the UK from low-risk countries would be dealt with swtly through electronic visa checks and e-gates at airports. The Prime Minister declared: Two years ago, the British public voted to leave the European Union and take back control of our borders. When we leave we will bring in a new immigration system that ends freedom of movement once and for all. But the plans still lack detail and face being picked apart by Brussels - because Tory chiefs admit any arrangements for future trading partner countries will depend on the deal thats struck.  Its widely expected that the EU will demand some kind of carve-out for EU workers in order to maintain trade with the UK. And in interviews today Mrs May admitted mobility is always part of trade deals. Whats more, Mrs May refused to rule out the possibility of high-skilled immigration going UP - despite vowing to bring total numbers down below the failed target of , a year. Tory chiefs set out details of Mrs Mays policy ahead of a speech to the  Tory conference by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. It comes after a report by the independent Migration Advisory Committee recommended treating EU migrants in the same way as those from the rest of the world. But despite more than two years passing since the Brexit vote, actual solid details of how the system will work are still very scant - and provided by Tory chiefs, not the Home Office. Tory chiefs said a White Paper detailing how the new system will work will only be published this autumn, ahead of an Immigration Bill next year.  The party say all security and criminal records checks would be carried out in advance in a similar system to that used by the US.But the Home Office has suffered multiple admin scandals including Windrush. And this suggests Brits would face similar checks when going on holiday overseas. Applicants will need to meet a minimum salary threshold to ensure they are not competing for jobs that could otherwise be recruited in the UK, Tory chiefs said. There will be no cap on student visas, which are run through a separate system. And Mrs May would not comment on whether there will be an exemption for care workers after warnings of an exodus of vital EU staff. Home Secretary Sajid Javid is preparing to set out the immigration blueprint in a speech to the Conservative party conference.

Welcome to the Conservative Party conference of , where the Tories are trying to pretend they can organise a knees-up that doesnt somehow end in whacking themselves in the testicles.Its day one, and theyve already failed. Their Great Blond Hope has not only been victim of a Big Daddy splash by Lord Digby Jones, hes been impersonated by Phil Voldemort Hammond and had his ideas characterised as not much good by David Mine Are No Better Davis.We are now uncomfortably close to the arbitrary date for leaving the European Union, chosen by a Prime Minister who herself was chosen because she wasnt someone , and as is the way with things on horizons it looks worryingly like an out-of-control hydrogen explosion.We all know whats happened - the referendum supposed to uny the Tories has caused them to turn on each other like cannibals who gave up chlorinated chicken for Lent, the question supposed to be settled for a generation remains unanswered, and Theresa May is still PM primarily because she isnt someone .So what is Brexit going to look like, under the Tories  . Project Oh Dear Jeremy Hunt is a man who has more in common with an Anglepoise lamp than the rest of the human race. He can be pointed, turned on, and turned off again, but usually fails to illuminate anyone. He is now second-favourite to be Prime Minister next year, which should be adequate proof of just how boked the Tories are.Boris is trolling, Sajid and Gavin are manoeuvring, Chris Grayling is in a siding outside Melton Mowbray and Hunt - a man who, the Leveson Inquiry heard, tried to hide behind trees to avoid journalists while still being visible to them - is now, let me say it again, one of the favourites. Its a bit like saying the green Opal Fruit is your favourite. Or that the USSR, which invaded countries that tried to leave it and killed millions, is just like the EU, which negotiates, even with people who dont know what theyre doing. .

Boo hiss to foreigners! Elephants are British! Wait, what  . Project Is This Really The Best You Could Do  Brexit, the Tories are assuring us and their donors, will mean a bonfire of unnecessary rules and regulations about meaningless, bureaucratic tripe like child car seats, not getting killed at work and hiding your money from the taxman.It gives us a chance to set our own rules such as only banning dangerous cladding  months after it burned  people alive, and onlyits on new buildings, which means all the people living in older properties can go sizzle.It also wont matteryou sleep surrounded by highly-flammable material on the sixth floor, oryou dont have a sprinkler system, or the fire exits are blocked or non-existent. After Brexit, you wont want to live anyway. . Project Genuine Fear  The government of the UK is trying to exit a union it doesnt want while protecting one that it does. To do so they are relying on a referendum they say must be respected, while ignoring a referendum they say must be over-ridden.All the people concerned were told beforehand that Brexit would spell the end of the Good Friday Agreement, a hard-won peace in Northern Ireland, and possibly the end of the Union altogether. That they have now,  months from doom, had this explained to them again by a comedian shows just what a bad joke the Tories are.Patrick Kieltys dad was murdered by the Ulster Freedom Fighters for exposing their organised crime. The Tories border solution involves asking those self-same people to pretend theres a border where there isnt one, and file paperwork well in advance before smuggling guns, drugs and people across  miles of hedge that we cant police. Laugh  Youll die. . Project It All Onto Someone Else Presiding over economic chaos  Watching John Lewis go down the pan, the world turn against you, and Jacob Rees-Mogg destroying all his own suggestions by moving his investment funds to the EU and trying to get a trade deal with the Peoples Republic of Jam Jar Or Something Like That  Well, why not shoot some more badgers. Not in the head, thats too quick. Kneecap them and watch them suffer. Burn some cattle, bankrupt some farmers, blame it all on the EUs crazy rules about bovine TB which isnt harmless so long as you pasteurise your milk, mostly doesnt kill cows and could easily be stopped with a vaccineonly we could be bothered.When someone says but Brexit means we can abandon these rules! Save the badgers! point out we still have to abide by EU ruleswe want to sell beef, milk or cheese to the EU. And dont, for heavens sake, let anyone say that the only way to change those rules is to, er, remain in the EU.With a Tory Brexit, hard or soft, youre looking at Jeremy Hunt being in charge while making swingeing NHS cuts, making it quite the worst reboot of a franchise since Indiana Jones And The Hospital Of Doom.Youll see people burning in another tower block before long, a fresh wave of terrorism when we havent dealt with the current one, and Tories blaming badgers, migrants, and anything  that moved because, after Brexit, theyll no longer be able to blame the EU. The Tories have spent the past  years blaming Europe for all the things they cocked up themselves. Without the EU, people are going to blame the Tories. Which is why their days are numbered.

But eventually, after years of comfort eating and feeling worthless, she decided to overhaul her boozy lestyle and chip habit for good.Using Fatnosis techniques developed by TV weight loss expert Steve Miller, the -year-old has since made an incredible transformation.Since starting her weight loss journey in her mid-twenties, she has dropped a whopping six-and-a-half stone and now wears size  clothing.Today, she has old photos of herself stuck on her walls. And she uses them to motivate herself to keep slim - even talking to them each day and promising her former self she wont get back to that. “In my moments of weakness, I look to my old fat photos and think, Don’t worry I won’t let you get back to that, I’m looking after you, she said. Laura, from Ruislip, west London, had piled on the pounds after eating pub food at lunch and swapping dinner for rounds of cider and caloric shots.  When she got home from the pub, a plate of oven chips would be her tea - or she would eat out at pizza restaurants and other fast food chains. But when she started a new job working with a homeless charity, she realised she needed to set a healthy example to clients to inspire them to be healthy. She credits former Fat Families host Steves simple eat less, move more Fatnosis ethos as the key factor in losing the pounds and keeping them off. Her confidence is now at an all-time high - and she says admitting to herself that she wasnt happy was the first step to changing her body. Laura said: I was always the chubby kid at school and always remember wishing I could fit into the pretty dresses like the rest of my group of friends.  I just wanted to be like everyone  and look nice, my confidence was at a real low growing up so I never used to even think about picking nice outfits to wear, the goal was always to find clothes that just hid the fat. I boozed and ate my way through college like many students do which didnt help the problem of my weight and by my late teens I was overweight, depressed and started an unhealthy relationship. She added: After years of feeling worthless and comfort eating, I broke free in my early to mid-twenties and started living le for myself. I decided that I wasnt happy and I wanted to do something about it, to regain control of my le and live it to the full. It was then that Laura began working with the homeless.  On her feet all the time helping others, she realised that she had to set a good example and be an inspiration for people in need. “They were by no means overweight, but I was and I wanted to be a picture of health and be someone they could look up to, she explained. She added that, having failed at plenty of faddy diets, meeting Steve was the breakthrough in her weight loss journey. I have overhauled my diet completely now from the days of chips and booze, and I now cook everything at home and eat a lot of healthy protein and veg dinners, with lots of walking outdoors for exercise, she said.  Looking back at who I was, I was never happy until now and I feel like I have my whole le back and my whole le ahead of me to enjoy the way I want to. Today, Laura can wear whatever she wants. I no longer walk into stores and look for the baggiest shirt to hide away in - I find the prettiest fitted dress and I think, Yes, Ill look great in this one, she said. Steves simple eat less, move more philosophy couldnt have been more beneficial and it works so thats the most important thing for me. She added that her goal one day would be to inspire others and help them with their own weight loss. Having gone through that journey, I will be able to understand and help them, she said.

Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping said: One of the partners is the city council which owns a lot of the housing stock. They can use threats of eviction to pressure parents to get onto their kids by saying we are not having this or you are out on the streets. Kne crime has risen by  percent across Nottinghamshire and the force, with its partners including the city and county council, want to see that number dramatically reduced. Kne crime went up nationally by  percent last year.  Councillor Jon Collins, leader of Nottingham City Council, said: All the evidence shows that the risk of losing your home or your parents and grandparents losing their home by being involved in this activity is a serious deterrent. This is one of the conditions in the tenancy agreement, which means thatsomeone in a property is - and they do not need to have been convicted - is involved in kne crime, just like drug dealing or any kind of firearm issue, that gives Nottingham City Homes working with Nottingham City Council powers to seek eviction.

Tanya Cox, , from Hull, has been working in the industry since she was  but says she often thinks about getting a real job. She was scouted as a glamour model while working as a lap dancer and says her past experience enabled her to be comfortable in front of the camera. Despite loving her job, Tanya says she thought about giving up her career when jobs dried up after she turned , reports the Hull Daily Mail. However, shes now finding success again as she breaks into the mature market. How did you get into modelling and was it something you always wanted to do  I never really thought about doing any modelling work but whilst I was working as a lap dancer, I got approached by an agency and was askedI would consider doing any modelling work. I was quite shocked as I thought you had to be tall and skinny to do any kind of modelling but they reassured me that was just the fashion industry and that I was perfect for glamour. How old were you and how long have you been doing it  I came into the industry at  and I’m now . What was it like at first and what kind of things you were doing  Having already worked as a lap dancer for three years, I was very comfortable with modelling straight away. I think its the taking your clothes off bit that worries most new glamour models but as I had already been doing that for three years, that was the easy part, it was learning to find the light and what angles suited me that took the time the learn. Was you aware of any challenges the industry faced at the beginning  No, when I first came into the industry, everything seemed great, people were much more reliable with higher standards always putting quality first back then. But now its more quantity over quality and trying to get as much as possible shot in the time frame are booked for. Was there ever a point where you regretted getting into modelling  When I first turned , my work really quietened off as some companies considered me too old for the young market but I still looked too young to break the mature market. It was a very low point in my le and feeling my career slip away made me so depressed at times that I wished I never started. What has been the best things about it  Are there any moments which stand out where you loved it  I think for me, it helped me to find my own inner strength. I was guilty of never sticking up for myself when I was younger but now Im the first to say when anyone is out of order, whether its towards myself, a friend or even a stranger. Also through modelling and dancing, I have now met the best friends that I have ever had. I trust them completely and never doubt anymore that they all love me, as much as I love them. What has been some of the worst things about it  The worst thing about modelling is the high cancellation rates which has been getting worse and worse each year since , but I dont think that is just an industry problem, I think society in general has forgotten its manners because I have noticed that more and more people cancel social meets with friends than ever before too.  Have you ever been judged based on your career  What do you think of that  Not in my personal le, but since my work started to quieten off and I have been trying to get a normal job, I do feel like employers are discriminating against me as I dont even seem to be able to get an interview these days, and when I was younger I always found it so easy to get work. When a place I worked at closed down, I had a new job within a week. How successful have you been  I felt pretty successful when I was younger but I do think I would of had a better career had I started when I was younger as it only lasted a few years before my peak ran out. I am now just starting to finally break the mature market, so fingers crossed I can make a success of that, but early days yet. Modelling must have changed since you started - have you seen that and in what way  It certainly has, all the technology keeps changing, I dont know how the photographers keep up. And unfortunately the budgets arent as big anymore. I really miss the days of make-up artists and clothing departments on all shoots, but these days its only the very biggest companies that provide those now and for most shoots we just get a list of what types clothing to bring with us and have to do our own hair and make-up. Do you think it will change in the future and in what way  We are seeing dferent types of models coming through now We are and I love that we are now celebrating ersity with models now coming in dferent shapes, sizes, styles and ages. I met a new model on set recently who had just started doing topless modelling at . Social media has also come to the forefront and many models experience trolling - is that something youve experienced  Yes, I have had a few negative comments but, for every bad comment I get, there is always at least  positive comments to counter-act it and the troll then usually ends up getting loads of grief for his her comment anyway so it always back fires on them.  Would you advise someone to get into the industry  What would your advice be and how would they go about getting a break  Although when times are good, its not just a job to me, it is my le and I do love modelling but because of how dficult I have found trying to find a normal job since, no I wouldnt recommend anyone getting into the industry. Butsomeone is  per cent certain that its what they want to do, I recommend joining the online portfolio sites over an agency so you can speak to the photographers you are shooting for direct yourself as the agencies dont always give you the right information. Just make sure you always check references and remember you should never do anything that your not comfortable with. Is age a big thing in modelling and have you ever felt stigmatised by others in the industry  There is definitely more work for younger models, but thanks to films like American Pie making MILFS, GILFS and Cougars sexy, it has opened up the industry to mature models too which is great but the down side is that once your above , everyone feels the need to point out the fact that your older by using the terms MILF Cougar etc alongside all your publications. I am still struggling with this eight years on as I keep getting called a MILF and find the term really offensive. Looking back now, do you feel empowered by it all  I feel that the industry has helped me to realise that it is OK to just be myself and that my imperfections make me human, approachable and more relatable. What agency are you with  Im not with any agencies anymore. They did help get me work when I was new but once you are established, the bookings come to you direct and I also had a problems with been given the wrong information and been sent on jobs for levels I dont cover.

David Bonnick was just  when he landed the windfall on a scratchcard and quit his job. He became an alcoholic and started using cocaine after falling in with the wrong crowd, Bristol Crown Court heard. Hes now been jailed for  months for attacking his girlfriend Ellen Sweeney when she finished with him. She was so scared of him she thought it would be safer to end it in public when he attended an appointment at the Bristol Royal Infirmary.  But Bonnick, now , did not react well and followed her in a furious rage to the adjoining Bristol Childrens Hospital, where he floored her with a vicious punch. She immediately lost a tooth and suffered a fractured jaw which needed metal plates inserted. Bonnick had made a chilling prophecy earlier that day, telling her: Theres going to be tears today, theres going to be teeth knocked out, you mark my words. He pleaded guilty to the attack in August and was jailed on Friday. Miss Sweeney, his partner of three years, made a statement recounting how she had tried to get away from him for a long time. She wrote: David is extremely controlling. Do what he says and things are okay.  If not he is violent and Im sick of being his punchbag. I fear he could do anything to me in private and I could end up dead. My le and being a mother are worth more to me than what is happening. Peter Binder, defending, said his client had a serious problem with alcohol. When sober he is the nicest person in the world, he said.

Although he has no signs of the illness now, doctors have said he could lose the ability to walk, talk and eat for himself at any time. He has also been told his le could end in his fties, like his mum Geri, who died at the age of .  Jordan was told he would develop early onset frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s Disease after inheriting a gene - which caused the degenerative conditions - from his mum. Last month, doctors gave the entrepreneur the crushing news he had a rare mutation of the MAPT gene, which causes the condition. And he has been warned his health will deteriorate as he gets older. He now plans to have his sperm screened for the gene so he and girlfriend Lucy Thomas, , can start a family before his symptoms develop.  Jordan also plans to tick travelling to Hawai, buying a house, and doing a skye off a bucket list. He said: “When I was told the diagnosis I was devastated. “We had been in the waiting area for what seemed like hours – it was only  minutes but it felt like an eternity. “As soon as I walked into the room I knew it wasn’t a positive result. “Nobody can prepare you for that. “If there are no advancements then I’ll have a shorter le than most. It’s like a death sentence. “Its very hard to explain. Were all dealt cards in le and I was just incredibly unlucky.  Jordan was given the news he had tested positive for the gene when he and sister Kennedy,  decided to get themselves checked after watching mum Geri deteriorate over a period of six years. He was finally given the results on September  after three gruelling months of consultations and blood tests. Jordan said he saw the full impact of the disease while caring for Geri, as he watched her lose the ability to talk, walk and eventually eat and breathe for herself. Her family first noticed something was wrong in , when she suddenly began acting out of character. However she was not diagnosed until  and sadly passed away in . Jordan said: “Mum was full of love and very much a people person. “No one had a bad word to say about her, she was very kind and lovely. “We’d noticed irregularities in her behaviour. I remember one Saturday she went to pick up Kennedy from school but it was a weekend. “Her character changed from being a loving woman and she became quite cold. “She seemed to lack compassion which was a huge change from when she’d covered us in love. “She slowly got stripped of her communication. She couldn’t talk a lot and then she began to lose her mobility and couldn’t go out alone. “As the disease progressed she lost the ability to walk and care for herself and for the last  months she was bedridden. It was heartwrenching.”  Jordan said that despite his initial shock, he and girlfriend Lucy have discussed plans for their future together and that he feels like his diagnosis will give him a unique perspective on le. They are considering having IVF when they decide to start a family as the process will allow doctors to screen his sperm for the dementia-carrying gene. Jordan said: “I feel like the diagnosis is actually a licence to live. “It’ll make me step back and appreciate the bigger picture. It’s going to allow me to make choices to live a fulfilled le. Lucy added: “We’ve decided that it’d be probably best to have children first and then get married. “We know it’s dferent to how most people would it do but it’ll give Jordan more time with his kids. “It’s hard to deal with knowing he won’t be there one day but it’s important to retain perspective. “We will have a le together despite everything.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum claims baby almost lost","story":"NewsMum claims baby almost lost four toes when single strand of her hair wrapped cut off circulationAlex Upton, , from Devon found her baby son Ezra wailing in painShareCommentsByHannah Smith:,  OCT NewsBen and Alex Upton with their children, Ezra,  weeks old, and Charley, aged six \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum claims her baby almost lost four toes when a single strand of her hair cut off the circulation for  hours.

After spotting his red, swollen toes, she discovered a piece of her hair had wrapped around his toes for around  to  hours - leaving him in agony. The unsettled baby had developed hair tourniquet syndrome, which mostly affects infants when hair becomes tied around their toes, fingers, tongue or umbilical stump.

His normal routine is he wakes up, has his bottle then has a nap. He wasnt having any of his milk and was just screaming. It wasnt until I was changing him and saw the little bit of hair that I realised why he was so upset. It was just a single strand. One of his toes was really swollen and it had become really red and sore where the hair was. I pulled at it and realised how tightly itd wrapped around his toes. Itd tangled around three or four of them. Dementia diagnosis for man, , as he becomes youngest adult in UK with diseaseI managed to get it off except for the toe next to his big toe.

His toes are so small that it was hard to get under the piece of hair. After  minutes, I thought Id have to call the doctor or take him to hospital but in the end I managed to get my tweezers underneath and pull it off. After that, I did take Ezra to the doctors just to be checked over and they gave me some anti-bacterial cream to put on it.

Retired engineer Tony, , snapped up the canary yellow vehicle shell for pound and spent six hours a day for a month converting the boat into a vehicle the wheeler dealer himself would be proud of. Tony, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, said: Making this Only Fools boat has been a laugh for me, Ive absolutely loved it.  I love seeing the smiles on peoples faces when they see my boat come through. If you watch one episode of the show and then watch it a couple weeks after you see something youve missed. So theres always something new to discover - the one liners are so smartly written and I just love it. Trigger is quite amusing because wherever he comes on he says alright Dave  I always laugh at that. The show just makes me laugh. If somebody doesnt laugh at Only Fools and Horses theres something seriously wrong with them.  Dad-of-four Tony bought the boat for pound, eight years ago and has splashed out a further pound, modernising it. Tony said: When I bought the boat it was already called Trotters Independent and we had so many comments when we were in Derbyshire that I decided to keep the boats name. When my mate suggested putting a car on it after Id had four pints of Guinness I thought it wasnt a terrible idea. Two months later Id started looking for a car to put on the back of my boat. Grandad-of-four Tony tracked down a seller from Haywood, Staffordshire, flogging the shell of a yellow Reliant Robin who wanted to keep the engine.  Tony said: I struggled to find a car because some people didnt like what I was going to do with the car. I came across a car for sale where this chap wanted the engine and I just wanted the body, so we came to an arrangement and I ended up with the body of the car. Tony had help at the weekends from boat builder stepson Richard Pemberton, , who joined him for eight hours a day helping to renovate the boat. It involved measuring the boat and assessing which elements of the car would fit. Tony said: All the work was quite technical, which is why I had to get Richard involved as he knows how to build boats. There was a lot of work to do between cutting things, welding and working with fibreglass.  It still had to look like the car, so the bonnet at the front is on the same plane as the back. Its just exactly the way it was when it was a car - just a bit longer and with a boat in between. The most exhausting and dficult thing was to work in between the weather because youre on the canal, so you really feel its effects. He added: The wind and rain can be scary. I nearly fell into the canal a few times barely holding on to parts of the boat, but falling into the canal would have been worth it to get this done. I was determined to get it done and the boat kept getting better and better, so it wasnt dficult to motivate myself to keep working. The more I work on it the more ideas pop into my head as well. Ive just installed a new tiller system, which makes it easier to steer, but I wont be adding any more Only Fools and horses additions. I think its all sorted now.  Tony bought the narrowboat eight years ago and moved into it permanently a year later. His partner of  years, Pamela Allen, , joins him at the weekends but doesnt live on the boat with him. Tony said: I live on the boat and have been living on it for the past seven years. I love it because I get my peace and quiet, and thankfully I never get sea sick. Ive got everything in my boat that youd have in a house. My home essentials include my fire, central heating, cooker oven, microwaves, fridge, and obviously Guinness. I moved into the boat because I got fed up of living in a house. Ive wanted to do this for about  years, and I thought Im not getting any younger andI dont do it now I never will.

Model Kira Mayer, , claimed she was victimised behind bars with many prisoners resenting her glamorous looks.Her chest was scalded “to the bone” in the alleged attack and months after the incident she still has a “red bleeding scar,” she said. She claims she got into a row with her cellmates who expected her as a “newcomer” to clean the cell and toilet. And the social-media star is shocked by le in prison in general - and says she wants to be fed oysters and have hotel service.  Speaking of the alleged attack, Mayer said: “Its been two months now, there was a deep burn to the bone. “And here they did not even give me any special medication to treat this. “I was just sent to the punishment box. “Im not a rebel, but I was strongly against the pressure on ‘newcomers .

Human rights monitor and prison visitor Eva Merkacheva - also a prominent Russian journalist - wrote: “Incredibly, she manages to look the same behind bars as she looks in her Instagram. “Long hair, and huge doll-like eyelashes.”  The prisoner, used to tropical photoshoots and exotic holidays, said: “I’m always beautulthe media visit me.” And Mayer has not let the incident prevent her from making a series of extraordinary demands from warders in her Moscow detention centre ahead of her move to a penal colony for her  month sentence. But insistence on being served oysters and deliveries from top restaurants has not gone down well. Mayer said: When they brought me some strange porridge for breakfast, I asked: Can I have a hot croissant, orange fresh, mixed omelette and cheese  “I thought it was possible to order food here like in hotel. They laughed. “Next, they have such ugly metal bowls here.

It also turned out phones are not allowed here. I used to have three mobile phones and was on Instagram all the time. “I askedI could get even the most basic iPhone with internet but they laughed at me even more.” Mayer pleaded guilty to assaulting a traffic police officer who stopped her driving her Mercedes without a licence on the way to a manicure in Moscow. She offered a threesome to the officer and his colleaguethey ignored her motoring offence, according to reports citing law enforcement sources. The policemen “declined her offer and detained her”, it was reported.  From her cell she admitted to Merkacheva that she was “very afraid” of jail. Later she said she “told myself I had to continue living. “Now I almost dont cry,” said Mayer, ex-girlfriend of Russian pop-singer Alexey Vorobyov. “My regular le is gone. “I was on the way to my manicure - but ended up in a detention jail.” She said: “Only now do I realise I used to live like a princess. “I spent the whole summer behind bars, its sad. “I want to go to the Seychelles. “I do breathing exercises and it makes it better. “Half of my fellow inmates didnt like me straight away for my looks. “The other half were asking me all sorts of girly questions.”  She also blamed her female judge Katerina Kirichenko for her “harsh” sentence, claiming she “did not like me”. “In our country you can go to jail simply because you annoy someone,” she said. She admitted trying to hide the fact that she had been jailed “but it leaked out”. She said: “I realised that jail might be good and will increase my popularity.” Her latest ploy is to suggest a hair selling business to her jail governor.

Hamilton will have said, ‘get a goal against them and they’re dead’ but the players were well fired up on Saturday, I didn’t have to do anything.“When the goal goes in from Boyle, great delivery from Calvin Miller, you know you have something tangible to hang on to.“I’m so pleased, I don’t want to go overboard because it is only three points but it is a big three points for the club.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb1fc3fa9f22.jpg ","title":"tennis clubs days may be numbered","story":"The future of a Maryfield tennis club is set to be decided this week.Members of the Craigie Community Sports Hub will meet residents for further consultation on Wednesday evening.Craigmuir Tennis Club, on Dalkeith Road, first opened its doors in the s.It is believed the historic club’s days are numbered following discussion between residents and Craigie Community Sports Hub.Despite becoming one of four sports clubs involved in the hub several years ago, the courts haven’t had a single ball served on them in more than two years.Hub secretary George Allan confirmed there would be a further discussions regarding the matter on Wednesday.He said the hub would make a full statement about the future of the club courts after the meeting.It’s understood the only viable option for the hub is to sell the land before reinvesting the money into other sports facilities in the local community.Craigie Community Sports Hub has already completed the development of a G pitch at Craigie High School and the adjacent pavilion.Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mr Allan said: “We don’t want to pre-empt anything until the consultation with the residents.“There is a meeting scheduled to take place on Wednesday evening.“Following that we will be making a full statement.”It is understood committee members from the hub surveyed the clubhouse and the courts in recent weeks before a decision was made for the potential sale of the land.Residents in neighbouring Dalkeith Road and Robson Street had spoken about the long–term future of the courts earlier this summer.Cameron Brown, , whose family moved into the area in , said previously he would “love” to see it reopened as a tennis court."},{"url":null,"title":"these were csaba laszlos last words as dundee united boss","story":"Deep inside the bowels of Tannadice was where Csaba Laszlo carried out one of his last acts as Dundee United manager, speaking to the press after his team hit self destruct in losing - to Ross County on Saturday.Csaba was quizzed on where it all went wrong for him, not just on the day, but over the course of his near year-long reign as the sense he was a dead man walking filled the air.He was down and seemed defeated when laying out his defence and it was clear it was going to be the last time he spoke as the manager of Dundee United Football Club.Askedhe had considered resigning, he said: “I don’t think resigning is an option but it was a terrible result.“The team know that and we have to take the responsibility for it.“It wasn’t just one or two people # it’s the full team who have to take the responsibility.“I don’t think we are so bad going by results but we lost five goals at home.“Especially being so positive after the Falkirk game, we were % going into this dficult run.“We knew it wasn’t going to be easy but we showed real confidence and the injured players have slowly been coming back.“We wanted to avoid a result like Saturday – it’s not what we wished for.”Csaba did confirm that, as ever, he would speak with chairman Mike Martin which ultimately led to him being sacked on Sunday afternoon.The Hungarian also conceded he and the players had let the fans down with the display and recent struggles.He added: “I believe in my players and they feel the same after losing the game.“They don’t want to push the responsibility away – it’s not that easy.

Last year he had two games in the hotseat after Ray McKinnon was sacked and led the team back to the top of the ision via impressive victories over eventual champions St Mirren and away to Dumbarton.At the time that prompted the board to urge him to apply for the job permanently but Ellis felt he lacked the experience to take on a club of United’s size.A year on that view might have changed and, was he to succeed Csaba, he would be a popular appointment in the dressing-room.The fact he’s a leading contender is further indication of how highly he is rated by his employers. While it was hoped Csaba would be the man to lead the team back to the Premiership, for some time now the former Raith Rovers stalwart has been viewed by many within Tannadice as a future boss.That said he does face competition from others with more experience and both Neilson and McIntyre will be interested.The pair could need convincing the Tangerines can succeed.Although he’s been out of a job since ending a dficult spell in England with MK Dons in January, Neilson’s stock north of the border remains high.As head coach of Hearts for two years from , he guided the Tynecastle outfit to promotion from a Championship that included hot favourites Rangers and Edinburgh rivals Hibs.On a tight budget, he then steered them to a top-six finish and Europa League qualication in their first season back in the Premiership.McIntyre has considerable experience from his time in charge at Dunfermline, Queen of the South and Ross County, where he lted the League Cup.He’s been out of a job since being sacked by the Staggies in September last year.While it’s known both are keen to get back in management, they’ll onlyin the right circumstances.In August, McIntyre turned down the offer to succeed Paul Hartley at Falkirk. He felt the budget there would not be sufficient to mount a promotion challenge.Likewise, earlier in the summer the vacant post at St Mirren was there for the taking for Neilson.After talks with the board, the -year-old decided their expectations were unrealistic and the job wasn’t for him."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb1fac75a342.jpg ","title":"youngsters bring dash of colour to dundee in art event","story":"Youngsters brought dashes of colour to Reform Street over the weekend in a bid to create an “uplting” atmosphere in the city centre. vw, px\"  Dozens of young people worked on designs at the Re-Formation live street art event on the thoroughfare’s cobbles on Saturday and Sunday.Co-ordinated by Dundee youth organisation The Corner, it was part of the Scottish Government’s Year of Young People .Most of the street was dedicated to designs worked on by those involved over the past four months, but space was also left for the public to have a go.Laura Cooney, community learning and development worker with The Corner, said one of the main design themes was chosen as mental health, as youngsters working on the project felt “really strongly” about the issue.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally ChampionshipPendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August .They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CRMax.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore#s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a - victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September  when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

Jake Speirs and Olivia Ferguson from Ayr have made it through intense auditions to compete in the dance contest in aid of STV Children’s Appeal. The -year-olds ranked in the top  out of a whopping  youngsters across the country. And the dance duo had never met, let alone danced together, when they were paired up. Now the movers will take on the cha-cha – a dance neither of them have done before. Olivia, who attends Alloway Primary said: “My mum saw it on Facebook and said to me ‘Olivia do you want to go for this, it’ll be a good opportunity,’ so then I applied. “You sent a clip in of you dancing andthey liked it you got invited for an audition.  “Then we got an email saying ‘come to the second audition’ but it wasn’t a second audition, it was to tell us on camera that we had got into the finals. “We went to a master-class day with all the kids who got through to see what style you’re best at. So there was salsa, cha-cha and others – and then they partnered you with someone and told you at the end of the day what style you’d be doing. “So we had no idea about who we’d be dancing with or what style.” Olivia has been dancing since she was a tot, initially Highland but now specialising in lyrical. And P St John’s pupil Jake only started dancing two years ago but has now competed across the country in his freestyle dancing. Recalling being told they had got through to the finals, the pair said they couldn’t believe it. Olivia said: “I felt quite overwhelmed because I wasn’t expecting it.”  Jake added: “Everybody went all silent.” Wannabe dance teacher Jake said winning would mean “a lot”. He said: “Mum would be mega proud.” Olivia added: “It would be amazing.” Rehearsals are well underway for the grand final on November  when the duo will take to the floor at the Crowne Plaza in Glasgow in front of  people and a  of guest judges.

When a local authority starts “mandatory training” of its own councillors in bid to stop embarrassing leaks – you know right away that you’ve got a council with a lot to be embarrassed about! Yes, I know, it’s hard to believe that South Ayrshire Council could actually be embarrassed at all. After some of the strokes this lot have pulled, you couldn’t give them a red face with a blow torch. But it would be interesting to know how many other Scottish councils have called in professional legal tutors to train councillors on their own code of conduct. I don’t know the answer – but I’m guessing it’s another sensational ground-breaking first for go-ahead South Ayrshire! Just like turkeys don’t vote for Christmas, neither do councillors vote for anything that remotely resembles extra work. No, this one has come all the way from the very top where uncomfortable leaks insinuate a lack of total control. Of course, a lack of control can quickly lead to losing control. And “losing control” isn’t a phrase you want to use anywhere near South Ayshire’s chief executive, Eileen Howat.Earlier this year, Ms Howatreshuffled the SAC management pack – she discarded a few knaves and dealt herself all the aces.Now, having sorted out the enemy within, she can focus on the only major threat to her imperious reign – that pesky Ayrshire Post and their constant supply of damaging leaks. The Post, as always, is independent and immovable. All that’s left for Ms Howat is to turn off the leaks at source – not just at any cost – but at all costs. And one of those costs will inevitably be the democratic process and the freedom of the press, or, in her own words: “the issue is information getting out before decisions are made by this council”. Hold on a second, I want to make sure I was reading that properly. “THE ISSUE IS INFORMATION GETTING OUR BEFORE DECISIONS ARE MADE BY THIS COUNCIL.” Call me old fashioned, Ms Howat, but information getting out before a decision is taken is what local government in meant to be all about. In fact, its what any democratic government is about! AndI want to live in a place where information is withheld until a decision is made – I’ll move to North Korea! I know some councillors are still a little unsure of the concept – but they were elected to represent the public. Inform – consult – listen ... and then vote. To help the really thick ones, they put a little reminder on the wall of the council chambers. It says “Ne’e r forget the people”. Perhaps Ms Howat should ask for it to be changed – maybe “Ne’er inform the people” would be more appropriate for the style of local government she has in mind. I don’t know what SAC hope to achieve with all this – but sending councillors to “even walls have ears” class isn’t going to work. The leaks will carry on leaking and the Ayrshire Post will carry on printing them. It was the Duke of Wellington who famously said “Publish and be Damned”. If you look out your window, Ms Howat, you can see the square they named after him.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilNorth KoreaAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"progress made ayr golfing academy","story":"NewsProgress made on Ayr golfing academyThe latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park.

The latest draft design of the facility following consultation shows just two holes being placed at the historic Old Racecourse public park. Three holes were originally proposed. So far the council has agreed in principle for it to be located at Belleisle and encroach on the Old Racecourse. The council is considering creating a pitch at Rozelle park to replace the lost playing field at the Old Racecourse. Another pitch would be made available at the new Queen Margaret’s Academy school. The development progress of the golf academy was presented to councillors at the South Ayrshire Council Leadership Panel this week . Depute council leader Brian McGinley, of Labour, said: “This is another step along the journey. “We support this because we realise golf is important for the people of South Ayrshire.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely.

Our proposals would deliver a historic agreement that provides a roadmap out of the EU and a final deal that will be good for the whole country.\"A deal that delivers on the referendum, because thats our democratic dutyhellipthat manages the risks of Brexit, because thats our responsibilityhellipthat grasps the opportunities of Brexit, because were at our best when were optimistic about the future.\"And a deal that protects our precious Union, because we are the Conservative and Unionist Party,\" he will declare.Mr Raabrsquos words follow remarks from Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, who hit out at the EU for \"taunting\" the UK since its rejection of the Chequers Plan at the Salzburg summit.The first day of conference was dominated by the partyrsquos Brexit psychodrama with Theresa May and her colleagues defending her compromise proposals against Boris Johnsonrsquos attack in which he branded them ldquoderanged.The Prime Minister insisted her beleaguered Chequers Plan was not dead as she refused to rule out making any more compromises to secure a deal.She sought to reject Mr Johnsonrsquos suggestion that, as a true believer in Brexit, his ldquosuper-Canada trade deal plan was better placed to succeed than her blueprint, by declaring: ldquoI believe in Brexit.Mrs May also did not deny that a no-deal scenario would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, simply stating repeatedly that the UK Government was \"committed\" to ensuring that a hard border would not happen.Ruth Davidson came to the PMrsquos defence, suggesting Mr Johnsonrsquos harsh putdown of her Brexit compromise was ldquonot wise and called for Tory colleagues to observe a ldquoperiod of silence to give Mrs May the space to secure a deal.Today in her address to conference, the Scottish Conservative leader will strike out again at the former Foreign Secretary and his fellow Brexiteers by extolling the Conservative virtues of pragmatism and practicality and decrying the ldquoivory-towered schemes of the ideological puritan.She will tell conference: ldquoHerersquos the truth: we can agree a Brexit deal under the Conservatives or we can risk handing the keys of Downing Street to Jeremy Corbyn. I know which one I believe is in the national interest. I stand by the Prime Minister.Last night, Mrs May failed to turn up at the Scottish Conservative reception or indeed any other reception in a bid, said party sources, to \"save her voice\" and avoid a repeat of last yearrsquos embarrassing episode when she lost it repeatedly during her end-of-conference speech. Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, filled in for the PM at the Scots event.Earlier, the PM unveiled a plan for a Festival of Brexit Britain to celebrate our ldquoprecious Union planned for .And she announced plans to charge foreign home buyers in England up to a three per cent higher rate of stamp duty to stop them driving up prices in the UK with the revenue used use to tackle homelessness. Murdo Fraser for the Scottish Conservatives said the party would need to see how the plan translated into the Scottish system but said: ldquoIn principle, we would be supportive of this.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8755870.jpg?type=article-full","title":"its-time-to-get-booking-your-next-christmas-party-venue","story":"Ifyoure looking for an exciting location foryour work partyor somewhere to enjoy Christmas lunch, consider these seven fantastic restaurants...----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Church On The HillHead along to Church on the Hill in December for some fantastic food, live music and a joyful atmosphere like no other in Glasgowrsquos Southside.Located right beside Queens Park next to the Langside monument, the iconic venue caters for any exciting special occasion.

We will not outspend him with reckless borrowing, we will not promise the illusory utopia he offers because, as those who have tried it have shown time and time again, it is based on a lie and it always ends in tears.\"He explained how no one should mistake the Conservative belief in evolution over revolution for a lack of passion or commitment to change, to a paucity of values or ideals.ldquoThroughout history, Conservative governments from Peel to Disraeli to Thatcher have delivered momentous change, drawing on our values that have stood the test of time.ldquoThe importance of family and community the strength of our nation, united by history, culture and identity standing strong as a force for good in the world the insight that economic freedom goes hand in hand with political freedom and, above all, the belief in the power of enterprise as the route to unleash talent and to improve lives.ldquoThat is why we back business, declared the Chancellor. ldquoWe back business as the cornerstone of a successful economy, as a force for good in our society and as an essential expression of our values.ldquoSo just in case anyone, anywhere, was in any doubt at all, let me say it, loud and clear: the Conservative Party is, and always will be, the party of business.Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Hammond threatened internet giants with a new digital services tax to ensure they paid their fair share of the cost of public services.He stressed that, with international talks stalling, Britain was ready to go it alone with a levy on the tech companies.The measure formed part of a programme to \"regenerate capitalism\" which the Chancellor said was needed to tackle the challenges of the modern world and renew the appeal of the free market to a new generation.\"The best way to tax international companies is through international agreement,\" explained Mr Hammond.\"But the time for talking is coming to an end and the stalling has to stop.

Cue a couple of decisions from the Court of Session and the current administration has been left staring down the barrel of a multi-million-pound liability that should have been settled years ago.The problem is that the longer the issue has been allowed to fester the bigger that liability has become and the authority appears to be at a loss as to how to deal with it. Though council leader Susan Aitken committed in January to agreeing a settlement this year, so far nothing has been forthcoming, with the womenrsquos legal and trade union representatives accusing the council of burying its head in the sand over even the most basic of issues.Unsurprisingly, the women are irate, and those who are members of the Unison and GMB trade unions are preparing for strike action that could see key cleaning, caring and cooking services in the city grind to a halt in the coming weeks. Yet while their anger is understandable and their cause is deserving of support, the prospect of the strike is worrying precisely because of what it is designed to achieve.All industrial action has an end point in sight, whether it be to increase wages or protect existing rights, and the end point for the Glasgow strikers is to force an immediate settlement of these long-overdue claims. The problem is,Glasgow settles now it is likely to open itself up to further claims of discrimination in the future, with the perfect storm of its discredited pay structure and its obligations under pensions legislation putting any woman approaching retirement at risk.A  update to local government pension rules means that pension contributions must be paid on all equal-pay settlements. Yet because pensions are calculated based on salary, any claimant retiring before Glasgow replaces its pay scheme - something it has committed to do, but which could take years to complete - will have paid extra into the Strathclyde fund without the guarantee of receiving the correct pension in .No wonder Glasgow is baulking at the prospect of brokering a deal. Nor is it the only local authority to freeze in the face of its pension obligations, with the Herald on Sunday revealing at the weekend that councils across the country are playing fast and loose with the pensions legislation, to the degree that some are complying with it while some are merely thinking about it and others are ignoring it altogether.The end result is that women are being discriminated against simply because of the area they chose to live and work in, with an equal-pay cleaner in Dumfries and Galloway getting her pension rerated long before the law was changed to say that was her right while her counterpart in Argyll  Bute has effectively been told to whistle.And so, while some councils grapple with what should be a simple concept, the women who help keep this country going with their daily graft are being left to suffer the consequences. Indeed, while it seems clear that Glasgow City Council has neither the means nor the wherewithal to give its equal-pay women what they deserve, the scatter-gun approach councils in general are taking to observing their pension obligations is creating yet another layer of inequality. The fact that that layer lies between the very women that were discriminated against in the first place is beyond ironic - and beyond unacceptable.Which is why, far from taking their strike to the streets of Glasgow, the cityrsquos workers should be leading women from every part of the country in a march to the gates of Holyrood to demand the Scottish Government intervenes. Councils have had long enough to tinker around the edges of equal pay it is time a higher power took control to ensure unorm justice for all.Such action would likely be a success, too,recent history is anything to go by. Indeed, just last year First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cut short an official engagement in Germany to come to the aid of the male workers of troubled engineering firm BiFab after they took the fight for their livelihoods to the streets of Edinburgh. The Government handed over a total of pound million and helped broker the buyout of BiFab by Canadian firm JV Driver, even though the dire straits the business had been floundering in meant practically all the workers went on to lose their jobs anyway.Buthundreds of boiler-suited men marching on parliament can prompt such a reaction, just think what thousands of tabard-wearing women could achieve. Who knows, they might even be able to force the Government to sort this whole mess out in time for the th anniversary of the  Equal Pay Act. And wouldnrsquot that be something "},{"url":null,"title":"charity marks opening of new headquarters","story":"A north east charity held an official opening ceremony last week to celebrate its new headquarters.Community organisation Grampian Opportunities recently made the move from Inverurie’s High Street to its new location on West High Street.The organisation had been located on the town’s High Street for the last  years.The new premises was officially opened by George Ross, founder and executive chairman of JG Ross Bakers, on Friday, September .Mr Ross cut the ribbon and he was assisted by Grampian Opportunities director Ray Strachan and chairman Morris Perkin.Speaking to the Herald at the event, Mr Strachan said: “This is the start of a new era for Grampian Opportunities.“Now we have the room to facilitate a lot more volunteers and clients as our last office was too small - as the workloads increased we found that we were beginning to climb over each other.”Mr Strachan added: “This new office gives us everything that we need, including disabled access.“It will also give us a chance to help more people not just in Inverurie but across Grampian.“Our staff have been brilliant and we wouldn’t have managed to get here without them, and I would like to extend my thanks to Mr Ross for opening the new building and donating our refreshments here today.”Before the opening event, Grampian Opportunities held a coffee morning in aid of Macmillan Cancer Support and it raised around £."},{"url":null,"title":"demand rises at thainstone s collective sale","story":"The Thainstone Centre welcomed over , buyers and sellers on Saturday, September  for its latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment.Strong prices were achieved in all categories, particularly in the tractor and plant section and increased demand was evident in the export trade.

Westminster itself would see its total number of MPs cut from  to .One ramication includes the expansion of the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross seat, which has Mr Stone of the Liberal Democrats as its sitting MP, to include a part of Lochaber.Mr Stone said: ldquoThese changes would make our constituency a monster in terms of size.ldquoPeople have a right of access to their local MP but that representative can only do so much and only drive so many miles to serve the electorate.ldquoThe journey from Evanton in the south-east to John OrsquoGroats is  miles.

If you look around the Highlands we are blessed with the most beautul scenery, but much of it can be hilly.\"This would provide a km path with no steep climbs or gradients and that could be a unique feature ndash certainly unique for around here.\"Mr Macauley said pound, in total would be needed to complete the project, which he hoped would be possible \"in a few years.\"Planning permission and landowner agreement have recently been granted for the next stage and an application for finance has been lodged with the Scottish Rural Development Fund .Mr Macauley said: \"It is an excellent project with a lot of potential to bring a lot of good to the community. It will be a safe corridor for people to walk and cycle and help people avoid going on a dangerous road.\"Highlands and Islands MSP Maree Todd said she strongly supported the project because \"absolutely everyone in the community can get out and enjoy nature.\"She said: \"I think the Peffery Way will become a vital link between Strathpeffer and Dingwall and all the communities in between.\"The path is both offroad and flat ndash two huge advantages.\"It will be a fantastic asset for travel to school and work or just for visiting pals.\"To find out more about the project and donate see www.pefferywayassociation.scotTuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

A report to councillors explained how monitoring of public buildings fitted with solar  was incomplete and that some ldquodata was calculated for two sites that had actually been deleted from the process the previous year.Worse still, despite previous agreed management action, ldquono record of eligible sites has been established, the report stated. It added: ldquoThere is no definitive site list. There is no robust system in place to capture meter readings for renewable energy from photovoltaic solar .Mr Black offered an apology for the auditrsquos revelations.Council leader Margaret Davidson told colleagues: ldquoOur carbon emissions are more than they should be and itrsquos costing us a lot of money. That canrsquot be changed unless wersquove got accurate management and record keeping.She said she would request that officials review the processes, how decisions are made within the relevant department and the scrutiny of the work it does.Speaking afterwards, councillor Roddy Balfour, a colleague in the minority independent administration said it amounted to ldquogross incompetence.He said he hoped the audit and scrutiny committee, which is chaired by opposition SNP councillor Graham MacKenzie, would ensure that the issues would be urgently addressed and keep the council within national guidelines associated with climate change policies.Highlands and Islands Green MSP John Finnie, a former councillor, said: ldquoThe councilrsquos latest bungle is seriously concerning. Itrsquos failed to collect data which is necessary to assess its contribution to tackling climate change. A commitment that lsquoit would not be allowed to happen for a fourth successive yearrsquo is cold comfort. It should not have been allowed to get to this stage.ldquoPerhaps I shouldnrsquot be surprised. When the council does collect information it regularly ignores it ndash all too evident in the shambles that is their public toilet closure plan. Letrsquos hope the appointment of a new chief executive will bring a renewed focus on evidencing decisions, by both collecting the appropriate evidence and acting on it.Tuesday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

In the meantime there has been an impasse in talks over funding between Highland Council and resort owners Macdonald Hotels.The council has stressed it remains open to discussions and the hotel operator told the Strathy yesterday it intends to re-open the talks early next week.There was a unanimous feeling at the SOS meeting that the community needs to show its support for the provision of swimming at the resort rather than wait for any resolution which may not come.It was stressed that this must be in a positive manner with the emphasis put on how important access is to the pool rather than it becoming confrontational.Pool users, HLH members and the wider public are being asked to meet at .pm later today at the layby at the bottom of the resorts brae to highlight their concern over the loss of swimming.A big colourful banner and  fliers have been produced.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise.

Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27469  ","story":" Caolán McGinleyI am calling on the IFA to respect the rights of Palestinians by cancelling this match and sending out a strong signal that the slaughter of Palestinians in the open-air prison which is Gaza, is completely unacceptable.- Sinead EnnisThe Irish Football Association have come under increased pressure to cancel an international friendly with Israeli which is scheduled for Tuesday th, September. Thousands of people have signed a petition set up BDS Ireland is calling on the IFA chief executive to cancel the fixture.Sinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis said the IFA have made the ‘wrong decision’ by hosting the Israeli soccer team and called on them to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. “Over recent weeks and months, many sporting, cultural and music figures have heeded calls from the BDS movement, not to perform in Israel. “The Israeli government must feel the pressure of the international anger at their mass killings, human rights violations and flagrant violations of international law.

But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"Scores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statisticsbased on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.Health, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

Speaking to the , she said: Along with my daughter, Donna we thought this would be a lovely little way of spreading some happiness and smiles to our friends and neighbours here at home.Its a great way to get people out of the house and to get them walking around the local area in search of little rocks of sunshine and then also to hide and leave their own creations for others.The craze has become popular with families, as many children and their parents are now actively creating these little gems and are keen to leave them for others. Rocks dont have to be hid, they can be left visible.There is no particular theme to the rocks, just bright colours and whatever little saying or phrase or words of wisdom that youd like to share.If you find a rock you are able to keep it or  move it for someone  to find.Doreen is keen for more rocks to appear. She said: Anyone can join in, all you need is a rock, some paint and a paintbrush and get creative!“Some people put our Facebook link Ballymena Rocks on the back and then you can take a picture and upload it to the site when you find a rock.The more people getting involved means that the idea can grow and can spread to other towns, maybe it will even spread around the world!There certainly has been alot of interest in it around the town with whole families joining in.Doreen is keen to organise an event where people can come together and decorate rocks, so watch this space for more information.In Ballymena the most likely places to find a rock is at the Peoples Park, Ecos Centre walk or around the town centre.Dont forget to upload a picture of a rockyou find one.Doreen concluded that she has heard many stories of how these little rocks have brought a smile to the face of many people just when they needed it most and pleaded for more people to become involved.Cmon Ballymena, help spread some happiness and get out and get active while youre doing it!

Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting. Children need to feel that the adults in the nursery are interested in, and value them as iniduals and they need to have access to experiences, resources and images that make them feel they are known and respected.“This is the environment and opportunities which both schools have been offering to the children in Dromore and Lurgan for the last  years.“Both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools have established outstanding practice in promoting communication and cooperation within their classrooms and actively foster within the children and wider school community a respect for themselves and others.  “The children in both schools have the opportunity every year to experience a wide and ied programme across all areas of the pre school curriculum with specialist resources and experiences available in areas such as roleplay, small world play, construction, creative arts, sand and water play, pre writing activities, a erse snack and dinner routine.Both schools have award winning outdoor classrooms which provide extensive opportunities to engage all their senses.“The two schools engage in a wide programme of extension experiences including class exchanges and staff exchanges which involves children and staff swopping schools for a day.“There is also an extensive parent programme which offers parents from both schools the opportunity to be involved in a range of activities, which ranges from social events to employment opportunities and training.“Within the two erse communities in which the schools are located both Dromore and Drumnamoe Nursery Schools receive extensive support and encouragement for their programme of events.”      "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650969.1538146408!/image/image.jpg","title":"hall hay lujah a new church is born in co down","story":"A spectacular structure made by a team of volunteers from a Co Down church has been attracting visitors far and wide.The church made of hay was constructed by First Rathfriland Presbyterian Church by way of an invitation to its upcoming harvest service ... though hay-fever sufferers can rest easy as the structure is for promotional purposes only.   The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church. People will go as a community to worship, they’ll move about each others churches.

People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later. People thought maybe nothing was going up this year, but we didn’t want to put it up and lose it in the storm, so we waited.”The Harvest Thanksgiving services take place on Sunday, October  at .am and pm.Rev Boyd added: “Our church building will also be open from pm to pm for the whole community to look at the displays, listen to live music and enjoy some apple tart.”On Saturday, October , a Harvest Praise Night with the New Irish Youth Choir will take place in the church at .pm."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"health  ","story":"The Brain Injury Foundation is holding a series of local information evenings following the overwhelming reaction to a recent televison documentary.News,  ..Project to enhance emergency careA #million project is underway at Craigavon Area Hospital to enhance emergency care and help reduce overnight stays.

The centre has been part of the Upper Springfield since  but it has changed and developed since then. I came onboard around two years ago and the centre is really about addressing the physical and mental health needs of the area.”The Healthy Living Centre is one of many successful projects managed by the Upper Springfield Development Trustwith physical activity classes including boxercise, zumba, pilates and circuit classes running in Corpus Christi parish church hall throughout the week. “We are open to what people want to do,” added Rosie, “we have an extremely popular Couch to K initiative and we have armchair aerobics as well for those less abled.“We also offer a counselling service here, the space here is really utilised. We run a social ‘prescribing programme’ which is a popular concept offered by your GP so that instead of prescribing medication, for say anxiety or in some cases depression, they may refer you to your local healthy living centre and that is where we come in.“Our activities have been proven in many cases to have improved the mental health of a person in that they can talk on how the centre has improved their lives.”Rosie spoke of how community engagement has increased at the Whiterock community gardens and allotment site.“We do hope to see the Men’s Shed model on the gardens, it would be another development that would address a particular need as older men as a group can become socially isolated.“We have weekly walking groups that go up the Black Mountain, Cave Hill, Bog Meadows and our cycling group is also up and running. There is great scope.”Looking ahead to the autumn and winter months, Rosie said that the centre will be encouraging parents and carers to participate in their Health Promoting Homes programme which is “trying to change mindsets in terms of healthy living, which incorporates nutrition.”“The programme is all about promoting the home as a healthier place for the children who are living with parents or grandparents,” she went on.“People are realising the connection between good physical activity, good diet and the impact that it has on their own health. It can’t be stressed enough how important it is in today’s society, there is something for everyone at the centre and we are here to offer advice and guidance where we can.”For more information and a class timetable go towww.facebook UpperSpringfieldHealthyLivingCentre"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"time for truth campaign travel to stormont","story":"THE Time for Truth campaign travelled to Stormont yesterday and submitted  responses to the NIO’s consultation, Addressing the Legacy of the Past in the North, during a meeting with NIO Deputy Director Chris Flatt.Mr Flatt is overseeing the legacy consultation.

Arron said that the hedge sits lower than the road, so they couldnt be seen.He believes it is there that the pregnant animal was hung up on barbed wire to be skinned and had its legs cut off in the barbaric attack.\"You can see the clean lines of the kne, and the wool and the skin was cut off - not pulled off,\" he said last night.Arron explained he had been trying to build up his flock, but now another of his sheep has lambed early because of what he believes is trauma.The lorry driver said he was keeping the horric story from his two young children - a son and daughter aged seven and six respectively - as it was too disturbing.He described those behind the grim attack as \"total scum to do this to an innocent animal\", which he believed would have suffered.\"How anyone could do this to an animal is beyond me,\" he said. \"Someone knew what they were doing.\"This wasnt a five minute job.\"It wasnt a pretty sight to come across this morning,\" he added."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37376081.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Arlene_foster_reaction_.jpg","title":"watch arlene fosters reaction after karen bradley praise for bbc what did she say","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The documentary includes an interview with Ms Hambleton who has been fighting for justice for more than four decades.\"What do I want  Me, personally, I want the b******s who killed my sister and the other  to be brought to justice, short and simple,\" she said.\"We could have walked past him when we were in Belfast.\"When people ask you howd you feelyou met them or saw them, you can never answer that question.\"As a teenager in  Reilly, who had been living in Birmingham at the time of the massacre, was interviewed by West Midlands Police but denied any involvement.However, he did admit to bombing a number of local businesses in the city and was sentenced to  years in prison for conspiracy and causing explosions, and moved to Northern Ireland following his release.The investigation relied heavily on the work of former Government minister Chris Mullin, who campaigned for the release of six men who were wrongly convicted for the bombing in .Hugh Callaghan, Patrick Joseph Hill, Gerard Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, William Power and John Walker became known as the Birmingham Six and eventually had their le sentences quashed by the Court of Appeal in  in what was one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice in English legal history.On two occasions Mullin interviewed a man who admitted to the bombing on the condition that his identity would never be revealed.But by cross-referencing information in Mullins book with police transcripts and birth records, interviewing eyewitnesses and a former IRA man, Mr Ware is convinced the evidence points to Reilly and Gavin.Reacting to the new documentary, Ms Hambleton, who is a spokesperson for the Justicethe campaign, said all the relatives of the  victims welcome the revelation which has offered them hope of finally getting justice.\"We all remain puzzled over coroner Sir Thorntons reluctance to address the perpetrator issue which they believe is a vital piece of the jigsaw,\" she said.\"This is the same coroner who has previously called on perpetrators to enter the witness stand which then led to prosecutions.\"The tireless campaigner has spent the last two days protesting with other relatives outside the International Conference Centre in Birmingham which is hosting the Conservative Party Conference.\"We are fighting the biggest juggernaut in our country which is the British Government which for some reason is protecting those who murdered our loved ones,\" she said.\"Successive governments in the UK and Ireland have allowed mass murderers to walk free without fear of retribution which makes a mockery of even having a criminal justice system.\"Whats the pointno one is prepared to put people through the prosecution process \"Last night Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed he will be requesting a meeting with Sajid Javid to discuss a number of issues relating to the inquest in light of the new allegations.\"I have listened to Ms Hambleton and will be requesting a meeting with the Home Secretary to allow her and other relatives to present their case,\" he said.Ms Hambleton, who confronted a number of prominent MPs and Government ministers yesterday - including Nicky Morgan, Justine Greening, Anna Soubry and David Davis - praised Sir Jeffrey for vowing to help.\"Nearly  years later we are still fighting for our relatives who dont have a voice, but nobody in the British establishment or Irish Government wants to hear us,\" she said.\"They wish they could bury us alongside those who died because we dared to raise our heads above the parapet and ask questions and demand serious answers.\"But we are encouraged that some politicians, including Jeffrey Donaldson, are listening to us.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may to open civil partnerships to straight couples","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

It was never going to happen this side of conference but will hopefully happen shortly afterwards,\" a source said.Irish officials are keen to see the proposal which is understood to have been completed some time ago by the UK.Just over a week ago, Mrs May said the EU \"did not respect\" that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK after Brexit after it rejected her Chequers plan.She reiterated there would never be a border in the Irish Sea.Mr Swann said he welcomed the Prime Ministers \"strong words\" in support of keeping the UK together.\"My message for Michel Barnier and the rest of the EU negotiators, including the Republic of Ireland government, is that Northern Ireland and its position as an integral part of the United Kingdom will not be a sacricial lamb in the Brexit negotiations,\" he said.\"We are approaching crunch time in the negotiations and EU negotiators should not attempt to continue the folly of using Brexit in a foolhardy attempt to break up the United Kingdom. Their words have repercussions and demonstrate an ignorance of the Belfast Agreement and the principle of consent.\"At the conference, Brexit Minister Dominic Raab warned that the UK Government will not accept two dferent customs regimes in the UK.Mr Raab said the EU needs to show less dry legalism in talks on Northern Ireland.\"Frankly, I think its outrageous even to contemplate it,\" Mr Raab added.Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party is holding an event at the Tory conference to ensure that \"the needs of Northern Ireland are properly understood\".She added: \"Our event marks the fact that we work together for the entire United Kingdom as unionists. It will also be an opportunity to explain why we need and want to leave the EU on the same basis as the rest of the UK.\""},{"url":null,"title":"man films handful of tiny baby turtles swimming for the first time","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

This will be followed by the Morgan Fuels SFC last four encounter between derby rivals Burren and Mayobridge at .pm.Twenty-four hours later at the same venue, Bredagh and Saul lock horns in the IFC at .pm and at pm champions Kilcoo take on Warrenpoint in the SFC.The Darragh Cross v Liatroim clash is a tough one to call.Both teams play in Division  with Darragh enjoying the better of results and are sitting just outside the top four with games in hand. Inconsistency has plagued Liatroim all season and they are precariously perched fourth from bottom with three league games left to play.Darragh beat Liatroim in the league - to - back in August and also accounted for Atticall, Drumgath and Bredagh in the championship, while Liatroim lost to Atticall, but saw off Dundrum and St Johnrsquos in the Championship.Darragh will look to Matty Hardy, Oisin McConvey, Shane Murray, Lee Morrison, Marcus Miskelly and Michael Monan with Liatroim banking on big games from P J Davidson, Conor and Ruairi McCrickard, Gerard McAnulty and Liam Middleton.Darragh seem to have the edge in experience and their exciting attacking formation should be too much for Liatroim to handle.The Burren v Mayobridge SFC clash is expected to be an intriguing affair with no quarter asked or given.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side sit proudly at the top of the ACFL Division , but lost both league games this season to Mayobridge, who are six points behind the leaders with a game in hand.Burren have been impressive in beating Loughinisland, Carryduff and Castlewellan to get this far with Mayobridge accounting for An Riocht, Saval and Clonduff.Burren are a solid all-round side and can rely on Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr, Paudie Poland, Ryan Treanor, Cathal Foy and David McEntee to take and make scores.Benny Coulter has Mayobridge purring again and in Ryan Brady, Cathal Magee, Caolan Gallagher, Conleth OrsquoHare and Kevin McClorey he has potential match winners who will all need stoppingBurren are to progress.Bredagh are expected to see off Saul in the IFC on Friday night, given they play in a higher ision.However, Saul are just one more win away from lting the Division  title and a win over Glasdrumman in their last game on October  will see them promoted as champions.On their day, Bredagh are a match for anyone and should have too much power for Saul. However, Donnan Ritchiersquos side showed against a fancied Ballymartin outfit that they fear one one andthey can repeat that sort of display then Bredagh may watch out.Bredagh will look for big efforts from Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Donal McKegney, Michael Robinson, Conor Francis and Owen Costello with Saul relying on Adam King, Cathail Arnold, the Harney brothers, Caolan Magee and Rory Mullen.Unfortunately, star player Pierce Laverty will miss the game as he headed off to Australia on Sunday to take part in a week-long series of Aussie Rules trials.Following this game, Kilcoo will continue in their bid to make it seven-in-a-row when they face Warrenpoint.Kilcoo have again arrived at this stage of the competition with a minimum of fuss and itrsquos going to take an exceptional side to wrestle the Frank OrsquoHare Cup from their grasp.Ryan and Jerome Johnston look to be flying again after an injury-interrupted season and they have the perfect foils in Conor Laverty and Ceilum Doherty with Paul Devlin directing affairs in and around the middle of the park.The Branagan brothers are also expected to have a massive impact on the game as they set about taming Joe Magee, Aaron Magee, Ross McGarry, Ryan Mallon and Ryan and John Boyle.There is also a county final to look forward to on Sunday when Portaferry and Ballycran battle it out for the Senior Hurling Championship title in Ballygalget at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 26%2C 1978  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plans for a new factory in Ballynahinch to manufacture cane furniture could bring  new jobs to the area.A new company mdash Pinewick Manufacturing mdash a subsidiary of the Pinewick shops, has applied for planning permission to build a , square feet factory on the Hillsborough Road.The ambitious venture has been planned by Mr Peter Wilkin, who has been running the Pinewick organisation for the past four years andproposals are approved then the new building would be able to provide  jobs within three years.Pinewick has shops in Ballynahinch, Belfast and Ballymoney and its Ballynahinch pilot production plant has been turning out a iety of goods, including plant stands, telephone tables and wall plant holders.

Midfielder Eoin Lundy took the gamersquos first score before Ciaran Sloan levelled matters with a converted free.

The local council was recently represented at the eighth international conference on UNESCO global geoparks in Italy.Senior UNESCO officials, scientists, policy makers, government representatives and local communities from across the globe gathered at the Adamello Brento geopark to discuss sustainable development and the activities of the global geopark network.During the event, Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Geological Survey of Northern Irelandpresented an abstract on the proposed geopark in the Mournes area.Local authority chairman, Mark Murnin, said the conference provided an excellent  to share the story of the aspiring Two Oceans Geopark proposal for the local area to an international audience.In addition, he said the event provided a chance to highlight the rich geology of the region as well as the benefits geopark status will provide to the area through geotourism.ldquoThis was an excellent occasion which allowed us to network and exchange innovative and best practice approaches with geoparks around the world, Cllr Murnin added.Since March last year, the local authorityrsquos aspiring geopark project team, in partnership with GSNI, has undertaken delivery of an intensive communications plan to spell out the proposal, while over the coming months there will be a programme of educational activities held across the council area.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy.The current focus is on firming up the boundaries of the proposed geopark with those involved in compiling the UNESCO designation confident it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The local authority is exploring the tourism potential associated with securing geopark status, with officials insisting there is a signicant financial benefit for securing it, with the benefits not just economic.Officials believe geoparks have a signicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.However, the global geopark brand does not impose any restrictions on farming practices, planning or development.Further information on the geopark proposal is available via Facebook on Geotourism in Mourne, Gullion and Strangford or for specic queries email geopark@nmandd.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/8702097.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesnrsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Temporary Deputy Chief Constable Stephen Martin refused to rule out ato the Patten-era recruitment technique, but DUP leader Arlene Foster MLA instead called for an examination of the issues of why Catholics are not seeking to join the police. “I’m all up for that discussion as a political leader but discrimination in the form of : recruitment is not the answer,” she said. “It causes more problems than it cures. “People should be appointed on merit, not on the basis of what church they attend or their religious affiliation. I do want to see more Catholic officers join the force especially in communities such as where I live the police service should be reflective of the community it serves.” ACC Martin called for nationalist community leaders to help. “I would encourage people with influence within the Catholic community to encourage and advocate for people in this community to step forward and apply to join the PSNI,” he said.   DUP leader Arlene Foster wants more Catholics to join the PSNI but opposes : recruitment. However the largest nationalist party - Sinn Fein - came under fire once again yesterday for refusing to call on Catholics to join up.Former Police Federation chairman Jimmy Spratt slammed Sinn Fein for failing to make a direct appeal to its voters. “Sinn Fein only paid lip service to this during my time on the Policing Board,” he said.Sinn Féin Policing Spokesperson Gerry Kelly MLA said Mr Spratt “completely misses the point” - that   recruitment was necessary to address decades of imbalance.However Mr Kelly still maintained it was the responsibility of the PSNI to proactively “encourage young Catholics to join the service” and that “no political party recruits for the PSNI”.UUP policing spokesman Alan Chambers MLA said his party supports measures to recruit more Catholics but opposes :.ACC Martin said it was imperative that nationalist leaders back call for people to join up.“If that doesn’t happen and our Catholic success rate were to continue as in the last few campaigns, it’d be inevitable that in future years you might start to see the Catholic composition of the organisation fall.“That would be unacceptable and I think in those circumstances all options would need to be considered,” he said.The   mechanism was established to rebalance a force largely comprised of members of one side of the community.Nationalist politicians viewed it as a success, but unionists said it unfairly discriminated against Protestants.Mr Martin noted it delivered an increase in Catholic representation from % to %.A report by consultants Deloitte – Understanding Barriers Affecting Police Officer Recruitment – into more recent issues found that the opinion of family and friends sometimes deterred members of the Catholic community from joining.The report also said many Catholic applicants dropped out of the recruitment process ahead of the initial selection test because they were hiding their application and did not want to attend an exam centre.Steps to address that include taking the test online.With the dissident republican threat continuing, Mr Martin said the ability of Catholic officers to travel comfortably into all communities is playing a part in their decision-making.Mr Martin said bringing back   was a political decision.“I don’t think we should be dismissing any optionwe started to see the Catholic composition rate continue to stall or indeed fall,” he said.The latest recruitment drive is seeking  new officers to replace those who are leaving, to keep the force at around ,.That will represent, by next March, a reduction of  officers.Mr Martin said: “We are reducing because of affordability, not because of operationally thinking it is prudent or appropriate.”Former Policing Board vice chair Denis Bradley said last year that Catholic PSNI officers are mainly still unable to live in nationalist areas of NI.try catch     .               ..

DUP leader Arlene Foster She reacted angrily after Mrs Foster suggested the terms of the agreement could be altered in efforts to strike an EU exit deal.\"Todays comments by DUP leader Arlene Foster on the Good Friday Agreement are unacceptable and reveal a reckless disregard for the peace process, prosperity and progress,\" said Mrs McDonald.Critics of Brexit on the island of Ireland have warned of its potential to undermine aspects of the international treaty, including its provisions for cross-border co-operation and rights protections.The DUP campaigned against the Good Friday Agreement when it was resoundingly endorsed in referenda on both sides of the border in .Elements of the deal have been altered by subsequent political agreements in Northern Ireland, such as the  St Andrews Agreement.In an interview with the Daily , Mrs Foster said: \"It has been deeply frustrating to hear people who voted Remain and in Europe talk about Northern Ireland as though we cant touch the Belfast Agreement. Things evolve, even in the EU context.\"There has been a lot of misinterpretation, holding it up as a sacrosanct piece of legislation.\"In response, Mrs McDonald called on the Irish Government to make clear that the terms of the deal would be protected.\"It should be remembered that Arlene Foster left the UUP, which supported the Good Friday Agreement, to join the anti-agreement DUP,\" she added.\"It appears the DUP leader has learnt nothing over the past  years.\"Brexit is incompatible with the Good Friday Agreement.

following the death of independent councillor Jim Brown in August. Having lived, worked and studied in Carrickfergus for most of his le, Mr Johnston said he take “huge pride” in his town and the people who live here. The father and local businessman said he wanted to see Carrickfergus “transformed into a town where new jobs, opportunities and investment are the norm”. He added: “My ambition is to make Carrickfergus a better place for everyone, by ensuring our vital services are properly funded and our businesses are supported to grow and develop. “Carrickfergus has a great story to tell and with the right support, I believe this great town can become a tourist hub for people from right across the world. As a sales and marketing executive for a local firm which trades worldwide, I see the opportunities that Brexit presents for our town in terms of investment and tourism. My focus will be on exploiting those opportunities and working with Council to ensure Carrickfergus becomes a town defined by the strength of its community and local economy.”Endorsing Mr Johnston as the party’s candidate, East Antrim DUP MP Sammy Wilson said he would bring “fresh thinking and ideas” to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council. Mr Wilson added: “He has a strong record of service in the community and a clear understanding of the issues that matter to local people.

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon. Shelf is now in itsrsquo new position, with books on it and it hasnrsquot gone wonky or fallen off over night, so unless it is the shelf-master of delayed action, I am assuming in situ it will stay and a good DIY job I have done.I was recently approached about a new writing project in a field and a genre I had never thought to write and my initial thought was, ldquoOh, Irsquom not sure I can. I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would mean the manesto I stood for Parliament on was not meant.If the customs union was extended in this way ldquoit would open the door to  Downing Street for one Jeremy Corbyn hellip because Conservative voters would simply not turn out to vote, he warned.ldquoSeventy per cent of Tory voters are committed to Brexit. They will feel deeply let downBrexit is not delivered orit is Brino ndash Brexit in name only.ldquoThose of us who get accused of standing too firm for Brexit and therefore making it easier for Jeremy Corbyn are not the ones who ought to be criticised, because what we are doing by keeping faith with the British electorate is ensuring the Conservatives can be in a position to win the next election.Mr Rees-Mogg said opponents of Mrs Mayrsquos Chequers plan can vote it down in Parliament without fear of triggering a general election which Labour might win, because fixed-term legislation meant it could not be treated as a confidence vote.The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act ldquomeans people like me can vote against Chequers with a clear conscience, he said.Mr Rees-Mogg insisted he continues to support Mrs May as leader, although he criticised her for saying that Leave backers had ldquovoted with their hearts in . ldquoI donrsquot know about you, but I voted with my head as well, he said.He made clear he would favour tax cuts following Brexit, saying he wanted the UK to become not ldquoa tax haven but a tax heaven.He said Brexit would not stop him drinking French wine, winning laughs as he recalled how his son had asked him: ldquoDaddy,we leave the EU where will you get your claret from The meeting was held in a hotel outside the conference secure zone and did not feature in the official programme of events.

However in business, things are really moving and the way we do business is evolving at a breath-taking pace.The biggest change we’re seeing is in all things digital. We now adopt new technology quickly and easily because developers are getting better at using a human-first approach to make complex things intuitive. Take contactless payments.Remember how the first few times you waved your debit card at a machine, it was a bit scary and surreal. We’ve rapidly become accustomed to contactless payments and things like Apple Pay. This once futuristic stuff is now common place and it is really transforming how companies transact.Along with these complex advances come the obvious threats of cyber security, the potentially ransomable value of inidual or company data post-GDPR, and the competitive market risks to businesses which aren’t already on their digital game.While we’re seeing a burgeoning community of tech start-ups through both our own Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and a growing number of incubator hubs in Belfast and Derry, as well as impressive numbers of IT jobs created from inward investment, it’s never too late to begin your digital transformation. The thing is,you’re a tech firm, your financial tech needs to be walking the walk too. Increasingly, we’re finding clients placing more emphasis on this in their choice of banking partner, above all .Barclays was the first bank to develop an ATM over  years ago, and the first UK bank to launch a credit card. In more recent years we were among the first to launch contactless cards, and we were the first bank in Northern Ireland to make cheque imaging available to our clients. In the past  years we’ve invested over £bn in new technology which has meant our clients can be sure our digital technology is right up to date. While other banks are now facing a catch-up period of investment and the challenges of upgrading their s, Barclays has the technology already in place. Our personal banking app was recently voted best in the UK, and our small business  allows businesses to access a pre-approved overdraft limit at the touch of a button.  Our award-winning corporate cash management system, Barclays.net, is tried and tested by the % of UK companies which put it through its paces every day.BEYOND NI: EXPORTS AND CONNECTIONS The spotlight is being turned on Northern Ireland’s exporting capabilities, brought into sharper focus by the issue of Brexit. Without doubt, export sales are one of the key opportunities for growing the economy. We are really excited to work with established export businesses like Moy Park at one end of the spectrum and a successful new tech business, Neurovalens, at the other. This start-up began le as one of the first tenants in the Barclays Eagle Lab at Ormeau Baths and due to growth, has recently moved into its own premises to accommodate its now more than  staff.While access to money is obviously important for business growth, access to our networks can be just as valuable for NI companies. With Barclays’ major presence in the UK and US, our London and New York private equity contacts are opening doors for Northern Ireland firms looking for market intelligence.This style of partnership working with a local banking team, which can link into a well-established international network, is exactly the foot up our companies need to make them competitive in a global economy.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"justin rush taking pride in recruitment","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Anyone that attended the  Belfast Pride Festival would have been bowled over by the number of participants in the parade, the huge crowds of well-wishers who assembled, and the sizeable number and range of employers supporting the event. It was great to see so many people unite and support the importance of ersity and inclusion, themes that are central to successful recruitment strategies. Perhaps, those of us who are in business can learn a lesson from the organisations, that quite literally, lead the way on the day in the parade. Prominent firms such as Danske Bank, Allen  Overy, EY and FinTrU were out in force at Pride. Leaders within these organisations truly value being seen as ethical, fair and engaged employers. They know that all their staff expect to be able to bring their ‘true’ selves to work. And of course, when people are happy in work they are productive, so it makes total sense. When it comes to the attraction of new talent to an organisation, we should think hard about how we position ourselves as inclusive, especiallythe intention is to appoint millennials. A recent statistic, published by YouGov and referenced by Fergal McFerran of Stonewall, at the Powered By Talent conference stated that “% of  to  year olds now identy as something other than % heterosexual”. Employers should derive two items from this statistic straight away. Firstly, it is highly likely your organisation has LGBT staff employed within. Secondly, employers seeking to recruit, must be seen to welcome potential candidates from all avenues, failure to do so could mean a signicant reduction in applications. Here are some steps to ensure that your organisation, is doing everything it can, to attract recruits from the LGBT community: Dedicate web and social media pages, that hold specic LGBT inclusive content. This simple measure says lots about company culture and openness. LGBT equality, include a statement of commitment when advertising jobs on-line. Ensure confidentiality and fairness. Train recruitment teams, focus on removing any unintentional bias, do your teams know why it is so important to be inclusive  Use proudemployers.org.uk, to advertise your jobs to the UK and Ireland LGBT audience. Join the parade, get involved in LGBT community events, nothing will say you are an inclusive employer more. If your organisation is welcoming of ersity, strives for inclusion and is visible in doing so, congratulations. Unfortunately, here in Northern Ireland many organisations are still not thinking widely enough in definition. Those organisations need to establishtheir agreed policies are indeed active practice.

The company produces GPS data monitoring, which is already used by some of the world’s biggest football teams – including Manchester United, Liverpool and Juventus. The firm says it is making multi-million pound investment in RD and staff training, alongside support from Invest NI. Invest NI has offered STATSports almost £m towards its investments in job creation, RD and staff training. The new jobs include a range of roles in HR, sports science and sales. Alan Clarke, chief executive and co-founder of STATSports said: “This is a hugely exciting time for us at STATSports as we embark on the next stage of our journey. “We have already established our performance monitoring technology with some of the biggest and best known sporting organisations in the world and this investment will allow us to expand our reach even further in both the elite and everyday field sports sector.” Earlier this year, it signed a deal with the US Soccer Federation. It means four million players will end up using its APEX monitoring devices. “I would like to thank Invest NI for its invaluable support in helping propel our business to the next stage of its development,” he said. “Its willingness to understand the company and align support with our plans has been crucial to our growth and will enable us to expand the business here in Newry.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Greg.jpg","title":"former belfast bank building sold off","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greg Henry, associate director of agency at Lambert Smith Hampton A former Belfast city bank building - on the market for £m - has been sold, Ulster Business can reveal.The former First Trust building on High Street was placed on the market last summer.

A planning application, made by PWD Developments, is seeking to create a mixed use development, which will incorporate two ground floor units and eight apartments.The proposed scheme would involve the demolition of the two-storey building to make way for the new three-storey project.The building sits across the The Pavilion and Errigle bars, was put on the market last year with a price tag of around £,.The proposed building design has been developed to improve the streetscape, and according to the architects, offers a clean, crisp and modern interpretation of a traditional design.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Foyle.jpg","title":"foyle port posts record turnover of m","story":"Posted on Wednesday  September  by John Mulgrew Foyle Port has posted record turnover of £.m while pre-tax profits now sit at £.m. Londonderry Port and Harbour Commissioners reported a record turnover of £.m for the year to March , . The % rise over the year means turnover at the port has trebled in  years. Pre-tax profits were down % year-on-year, dropping from £m to £.m. Foyle Port chief executive, Brian McGrath, said: “The outstanding corporate performance of the organisation, year on year, demonstrates the in-depth strength of our operational team.” “The port’s location at Lisahally underpins our key position as an Atlantic gateway for the United Kingdom and Europe.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards.
