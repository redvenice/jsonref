Switzerland and Germany have been ided by the coronavirus pandemic. Fences, concrete obstacles or barrier tapes separate them after the borders were closed to slow the spread of the virus. But love cannot be locked away“Look, we even marked the border on our blanket,” laughs Sabrina. And indeed just below the barrier tape a black line ides the cloth in half. Lying on one half is Sabrina, from Basel on the other, Davor from Wiesbaden. We are in Riehen, the rich suburban community of Basel.It is the first time that the two of them have seen each other since the border was closed a good six weeks ago. The Covid-19 pandemic caused Switzerland and its surrounding countries to close their borders mid-March. Only people who work in another country and companies transporting goods are now allowed to cross the borders at the few crossings that are still open.It is a warm spring day. Riehen is famous for its cherry trees, thanks to the mild climate of the Rhine plain. And on these cherry trees, which are in blossom on both sides, the border guards have attached barrier tapes which now mark what is accessible. These tapes also trace the border lines which were reinforced with barbed wire during the second world war.For the people on both sides, these restrictions are a serious disturbance, as the border has hardly been noticed in recent decades. Friendships exist across borders, as do families and lovers.“Take pictures of us,” says Sabrina. “It’s good if this becomes known.” An untenable situation for her. Davor arrived today to see his girlfriend. It takes three and a half hours to drive from Wiesbaden, and he will return in the evening.Despite everything, the mood is good on this friendly day. Along the barrier tape several groups of people have arranged to meet: separated families, friends, other lovers. A group of young men has set up camping chairs on both sides of the barrier. All three are from Lörrach in Germany, the neighbouring community of Riehen. One of them is studying in Basel. This is the only place they can meet and drink beer together.The border stretches up the hill. A bit further up the edge of the forest, I meet Diethard (on the German side) and his girlfriend Sibel (on the Swiss side). Sibel, also a German citizen, works in a clinic in Switzerland: “If I were to officially go over to Germany, I would first have to be in quarantine for two weeks. That’s impossible.”Now and then an army helicopter flies along the unclear border, making sure the rules are obeyed on the ground. There soldiers reinforce the border guards. If a couple gets too close to each other on the border, the guards usually turn a blind eye.This is not the case everywhere. Further east on Lake Constance are Kreuzlingen (Switzerland) and its sister city of Constance (Germany). They have grown together completely. In some places, the fence erected by the Swiss during the second world war to prevent Jewish refugees or German opposition members from crossing the border still exists.Since the border is shorter and clearer here than at Basel, it was easier to close it again in the wake of the pandemic.Shortly after the closing of the border, I meet Katarina from Frauenfeld, in Switzerland, and Ivo, a student from Konstanz. Three times a week they meet at the border, also to exchange tenderness they met in Croatia only last New Year.Here, physical closeness was a thorn in the side of the Swiss law enforcement officers: a week later, when I saw the two of them again, kissing was no longer possible. A second fence was raised two metres away from the first, under strong protest from the local population. Now Katarina and Ivo can only look into each other’s eyes.But they still have it good: along the Italian and French borders, such meetings were always out of the question, because in Italy and France – unlike in Switzerland and Germany – strict curfews prevented this.With the flattening of the corona curve, demands are now being made to open the borders again. Not only families and couples want their normal relationship back, but also the trades that usually do good business on the other side."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b65c9de0703d788c1f220a6704d600e5be628b8/0_30_4220_2532/master/4220.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e3dbc0fd52405645072bf36db927024b","title":"gilbert and george our new normal coronavirus instagram diary","story":"For decades the suited pair have spent their days strolling around London. Now due to coronavirus they’ve stoically adapted their routine, as shown in a strangely moving video diaryAged 76 and 78 respectively, the renowned artist couple Gilbert and George are of the age supposedly most in need of isolating against the coronavirus. Yet exploring the streets of London has been their life since they met as students in 1967 – taking photographs, picking up unusual objects, observing the people around them. There is no second home for them abroad or in the country – their only residence is the house on Fournier Street in east London where they have lived since the 1960s.So that is where they are holed up. And this week, they are releasing a series of glimpses into their lockdown life, as they unveil their video diary on White Cube’s Instagram account.In the first entry on Monday, they revealed what they call in a handwritten title Our New Normal Walk. Wearing their trademark suits, they walk with deliberation around a line of tables in their home studio. First they do a circuit in single file, then they walk past each other from opposite sides of the tables.In the foreground is an elegant varnished circular wooden table, laid with antique ceramics, twigs and plants. There’s also a photograph of a young friend or relative on it. This picture surely symbolises everyone they feel cut off from. Gilbert and George are nothing if not social artists. Their art works are visceral documents of a changing Britain, from confrontational 1970s scenes of skinhead street life to a recent series that used empty nitrous oxide canisters collected on their urban walks.They’ve lost the world, but the walk goes on. Gilbert and George find spiritual solace and aesthetic order in the simple ritual of promenading together. For them, London is the only place worth walking in. As students, they used to hike for miles right through the city until they reached the countryside. Now they are isolated in their own house, walking around a table laden with personally significant objects.In Tuesday’s video diary, they reveal Our New Normal Relaxing. Now there is just one long work table. Gilbert lies on one side of it doing exercises in his suit. George sits on the other side in a rocking chair, equally suited, reading a book. George is an avid reader who has worked his way through most of classic 19th-century British fiction. So his coronavirus reading is probably quite meaty although I can’t make out the volume’s title. It is as if they are enacting the duality of mind and body. While Gilbert exercises his limbs, George prefers a mental workout.It turns out the funny, sad art of Gilbert and George is perfectly suited to capturing the “new normal”. Formal and disciplined, yet always on the verge of surreal slapstick, their routines resemble a fraught attempt to maintain civilised codes in a chaotic world. Right now that’s what we are all trying to do. Confined to their quarters, Gilbert and George appear to be acting out set routines to stop themselves going mad. Is the spectacle quietly heroic or is it a black farce by Samuel Beckett? That probably depends not only on how their series pans out – will their routines suddenly collapse into a New Abnormal? – but how the history we are experiencing unfolds.“Ours is essentially a tragic age”, wrote DH Lawrence in Lady Chatterley’s Lover, “so we refuse to take it tragically.” Gilbert and George in their diary of the New Normal act out that defiance. They refuse to pity themselves and don’t even consider giving up. Their stoic adaptation of their habits is quietly moving. Can’t walk through London? They will walk at home. Can’t go out? They can still exercise body and mind. These patriotic artists present their own cheerful manifesto for the coronavirus spirit, the new East End proving as courageous as the old one was in the 1940s. And yet there is a tension to this endurance, an undercutting hint of the absurd. We’re fine, their studied normality insists. Absolutely FINE.With its brittle poise, their diary is a perfect example of what makes Gilbert and George great artists of our times. They immaculately press on the nerves of this age of polite dread. And they offer the best advice they can in a scrawled final message – “Gilbert and George say: Don’t get it!”Gilbert and George’s online diary is available at White Cube’s Instagram. Posters are available at The Online Art Show."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68907e553be4e02cca96461240e8eb7babcee45e/0_398_5976_3586/master/5976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d24f062db2b227cfcd7d5d0d10336031","title":"life on the road during coronavirus lockdown photo essay","story":"Photojournalist Sean Smith travels with long-haul drivers delivering essential goods during the UK lockdownby  Lisa O\u0027Carroll photographs by  Sean SmithFresh breezes carry the scent of spring meadows across the empty motorways as thousands of truckers keep the nation stocked with food and medical supplies.Long-haul drivers’ journeys have been cut by up to three hours and they have received heartwarming expressions of appreciation from people clapping them on their way from motorway bridges.But there is also hardship for those not in the essential goods business, and some surprising letdowns including closures of toilets and exceptional reckless driving to contend with. One car driver was recorded at 134mph in a 40mph zone in London, while Gloucestershire police clocked a driver at 122mph on the M5.But lockdown also brings out the best in people, says Bill Dommett, 62, a driver with C\u0026ampD South West, based in Chard, Somerset, during a trip with the  onboard.“You see kids, adults, elderly people waving and clapping and they have little placards. You give a hoot or a smile and you can see they are so happy. I don’t look at myself as anyone special, I’m just a lorry driver, so seeing people appreciate what you are doing although you’ve never been appreciated like that before is really nice. It’s heartwarming and brings a tear to your eye a bit,” says Dommett.He tells of another incident in the past week when he bought 15 bars of a new variety of Galaxy chocolate for his prison-officer daughter, who says it kept her going after he brought a bar home for her one night.“The cashier came round and picked up another five bars and handed them to me, saying, ‘That’s from one key worker to another, stay safe and well and hopefully see you next week,’” said Dommett. “It’s just really made me stop. What a gesture.”Mark Bagley, 45, is a night driver, cabbing a double-decker 60ft truck for the same firm. His usual route is the 340-mile return journey from Chard to a Palletforce distribution centre in Burton upon Trent, where he can drop off or pick up vital supplies ranging from bread, flour and fruit to industrial supplies.Each way takes about three and a half hours, depending on accidents, bottlenecks and congestion.Covid-19 has emptied the roads, reminding Bagley of the big open countryside of the US where the only other vehicles are the tractors and combines slowly moving through the crops.“Before coronavirus, you’d see about 300 vehicles an hour. Now it’s a completely different world. I’ve driven in the States quite a lot and it’s very similar countryside. I thought you’d never see that in this country but when coronavirus hit it was like I was driving in Wisconsin again,” says Bagley.It is not just business trips and family car journeys that have vanished, but also truck carrying non-essential goods.“It’s been very spooky,” says Dommett. “If you go to a service station now, there are two or three cars in the car park, no caravans, no coaches.”But there are upsides too, he says. “It’s so nice to be able to get into your lorry and set the cruising speed at 53 to 56mph and just stay there without having cars in front doing 50mph forcing you to use the gears.” Like everywhere, there are those flouting the lockdown rules, and Bagley says he has been shocked on one or two occasions.“The other day I had two bikers on Harley-Davidsons on either side of me – that’s the middle lane doing 80mph and his friend doing the same on the inside of me on the hard shoulder. This is in broad daylight. There was a car in front of me and a truck in front of the car and next thing the bike on the inside swerves in between the car and the truck. I thought: I hope he falls off his bike and breaks his neck. It made me really angry.“You’ve got a five-year-old girl dying of Covid and you have these 3435-year-old men messing around with people’s lives on the motorway. It was just depressing to see, especially as you have the electronic matrixes every gantry and bridge saying “Stay home, essential travel only, save lives”. It’s constant, there are no excuses. You don’t drive on the hard shoulder anyway, even at 80mph,” says Bagley.As expected, she has seen larger volumes in collections and deliveries to supermarkets, including Morrisons’ regional distribution centre in Bridgwater, Somerset, as well as garden furniture and patio tiles. But there have also been some surprises including an increase in orders for hot tubs and pools.Small breweries have stopped deliveries, while business for a client who supplies wood-burning stoves has plummeted, as fitting the furnaces would involve workers entering a home for non-essential work, which is advised against.Dommett having a lunch break on the road.C\u0026ampD South West also did a twice-weekly run to central London with hotel minibar stocks including water bottles, snack packets and chocolate. The supplier is still trading but the hotel business evaporated overnight.The decline in custom has also hit drivers. Food is no longer available at service stations, which have also closed toilets and showers.“I think it’s disgusting,” says Dommett. “We are out on the road the whole time keeping supplies moving, where are you supposed to wash your hands?” he said, underlining the risk that creates of spreading the virus between different locations.One day Dommett might be in Wolverhampton, another in Middlesbrough or nearer home, picking up or dropping off farm feed. He remembers the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, when everything and everyone entering a farm was disinfected, and cannot believe the cavalier attitude of some when it comes to hygiene and coronavirus.He thinks some depots might have used Covid-19 as an excuse to close toilets they did not want to provide for drivers in the first place.A spokesman for the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said: “It goes against health and safety as essentially a lorry driver is at work and should have access to toilets where they collect or deposit loads. We had loads and loads of complaints at the beginning and still get one or two a day. We got on to the Department for Transport and phoned the various depots too.”Hammond says she tries to keep up morale, giving drivers laminated drawings of rainbows for their windscreens and baking a seven-layer coloured cake for her workers.While her business is going OK and might be big enough to survive, she fears for the smaller family-run businesses.Paul Mummery, an RHA spokesman, says: “There are a lot of truckers out there who just want to get back to work, even if they are furloughed and that might seem like it’s OK. There’s an anxiety that volumes of trade won’t return and this is a precarious industry anyway.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a608a2b53ff6b52170a0ca092bbaed84d738b62/0_234_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa4e8af3ccc01b7b854e8b7052d65a17","title":"readers favourite coronavirus street art laugh uk lockdown houses roads shops","story":"Houses, roads and shops all over the UK have been redecorated and reinvigorated during lockdownSeeing this makes me feel proud of what we have in the UK. Without the NHS, we would be in serious trouble in normal times, let alone during this pandemic. I have friends who are working in the NHS, in the care sector and as key workers. They are working seriously hard in difficult circumstances to make our lives the best they can be.It also makes me proud of the people in my borough. They are pulling together, using their skills and doing their bit to check on each other and help out in these strange times. Whether it’s amazing artwork like this, online quizzes, DJ sets, online advice for business, craft making or calling up lonely people for a chat, they are all pulling their weight through tough times.This piece of work stands out and really brightens up the street. I witnessed the artist finishing the piece and people who were out on their daily walk were saying how great it was. It’s a conversation piece and makes people smile when they walk past. Jimmy Lee, DagenhamIn these difficult times street art is a great way to connect and express the way we are feeling. Vic Brown, TamworthThis curious glittery sign appeared on the street overnight and made me stop, smile and take a photo. I was pleased to see that there’s no shortage of creativity despite everything else that’s going on. Ben Park, Ealing in LondonThis made me happy. It was great to see something someone has made just to share and spread cheer. Simon Doughty, DesboroughMy partner works in our local hospital and it made her day when our next door neighbour painted her back wall in a such a glittery fashion. Ashley Woodfall, BoscombeMy wife Mel is an artist. She took the side of our house as a canvas. This is her with our daughter. She’s now encouraged all her friends to stop by when they are on their allotted exercise, take a photo and send it to her. She is then going to create a collage of the photos. Seeing this makes me feel proud. Kevin Chappell, Wirral.Seeing the message to care workers filled me with both happiness and sadness. Happiness to know that someone has created this to acknowledge and thank those who strive everyday to care for our loved ones. Sadness that these amazing people have for so long been overlooked and undervalued. Tracy Wilson, South Norwood in LondonA few weeks ago the council painted social distancing markers on the promenade. They were a bit utilitarian. A few days later someone gave the little people faces and personalities. When I first saw them, they made me laugh. I look forward to seeing them every day on my daily walk. Jacquie, Worthing.Every time I walk past this house it makes me smile as they have obviously put a lot of effort into sending a message of support to our NHS. As I was taking a photo this morning, one of the housemates was leaving and chatted about ordering the chalks from Amazon and spreading a little joy in the world. Great stuff. Peter Spark, OxfordI walk past this while taking my daughter to school. It had been vandalised for years until our local community group commissioned a local artist to create a design as a tribute to our key workers. I find it uplifting and love the fact that it’s something the whole community can appreciate. Angie Talbot, LeedsThese sign paintings have been accumulating over the past months. They have become a landmark in our area. The route is a main road between two major hospitals so ambulances pass by regularly.I like it because it is representing something we all want to say. With all the museums closed, it feels like art has found a way to come out into public space and remind us all why we need it here – and more than ever at this time. Asif Khan, Hackney in LondonI saw this on the front of a closed down takeaway restaurant. I love the bright colours and the sentiment. Annie Willetts, Sydenham in LondonI took this on the last weekend before lockdown in Manchester. I have not been in the city centre since, sticking to my local area. It makes me sad for all the amazing small businesses in this city, but hopeful that they will survive and be thriving again soon. Elizabeth Relins, ManchesterI run on the cycle path a couple of times most weeks. There is a long hoarding separating the path from a brownfield building site and it is constantly changing and evolving with artwork, ranging from some pretty crappy tags to some terrific pieces. This comes somewhere in the middle. I love how it has taken the Corona logo and made it into something more menacing and timely. I also like the “please wash your hands” strap along the top. I don’t know how long it will last, but it’s there for now. Kate Matheson, BristolWe saw this piece of street art just before the lockdown measures were put in place. It is a striking and skilful design. When we saw the work it seemed very prescient. At the time people were stockpiling toilet paper and the art work satirically incorporates a loo roll instead of a dot on the “i” in “virus”. While humorous, the work was an ominous indication of the effect the virus was going to have in the weeks to come. Michael Mulvihill, GatesheadHackney Wick is alive with street art. Every day you turn a corner and something new grabs your eye. This piece appeared early on in the crisis. To me it captures the public’s mood to the Covid-19 crisis – NHS, masks, loo roll, don’t panic. Jacqueline Bruce, Bow in LondonOur pedestrian tunnel had been a tagging magnet for a long time. The interior was greatly helped a few years ago when someone painted inidual bricks in a myriad of different shades, making the wonderful rainbow that appeared overnight on 8 April all the more perfect. Our local social media has been abuzz with how uplifting it is and how emotional people feel travelling through it. We’re all hoping it will be preserved post lockdown. Helen Wade, HoveI know my friends are missing being at school and that the teachers are missing us too, so I wanted to use my art as a voice to acknowledge that. The crossing at my school, Comberton Village College in Cambridge, felt like the perfect place to make an artwork. Rowan Briggs Smith, CambridgeThis series of posters is outside a cafe in the Cathays area of Cardiff. It’s an image of hope and sustenance that helps me remember that these dark days will soon be over.

These measures have impacted upon the spending behaviours of consumers as well as how businesses and their employees operate. It has also affected the provision of services provided by government, including health and education.The monthly figures corroborate that these estimates reflect the declines recorded in March 2020, when restrictions were imposed in response to the coronavirus.This chart shows just how sharply the UK economy shrank in the first quarter:But this will, I fear, be dwarfed by the slump in growth in the current quarter.Here are the key points from today’s UK GDP growth report, showing how the economy shank in January-March:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.We start with some breaking news - the UK economy has suffered its worst contraction since the depths of the financial crisis, as the Covid-19 slump begins.That’s the biggest quarterly drop in activity since the fourth quarter of 2008 - after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the financial crisis.Yesterday, chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the UK recession was “already happening”, as he extended the jobs retention scheme until October. This data shows he was absolutely right.More details and reaction to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7dbdd4756450a576c2b0ebdc78b7ca750672a6af/551_0_1996_1200/master/1996.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05371306df416d891493a12b4ec38250","title":"nice try mr oleary but ryanair doesnt write the rules","story":"Airline boss’s plan to restart two of every five flights in July came with two rather large conditionsMichael O’Leary, no doubt, is sincere in his aim to restart two out of every five Ryanair flights from the beginning of July. But note how his plan came with two large conditions: “Subject to government restrictions on intra-EU flights being lifted, and effective public health measures being put in place at airports.”Think of the flight plan, then, as also being a lobbying exercise. Having glimpsed that the lockdown door is ajar, Ryanair wants to force it open. And it would rather fuddy-duddy politicians didn’t make troublesome rules such as enforced blocking of the middle seat, a measure O’Leary has called “idiotic”.Ryanair is not alone in the aviation industry in trying to push the pace. Yet, far from showing how easy it would be to observe physical distancing measures, the company’s two-minute “return to flying” video really demonstrated the reverse. It portrayed a passenger rolling her bag through an airport that was comically empty. Real life isn’t like that, at least not when flying Ryanair.You can’t blame O’Leary for giving it a go, but simply declaring that “it’s time to get Europe flying again” is unlikely to be enough. Government messaging on physical distancing may be woefully confused, but ministers – not Ryanair – still set rules on public safety.Such an outcome would definitely count as severe, but few would previously have considered it plausible. Landlords and tenants are quarrelling over the fallout from Covid-19, but Landsec was describing a rental catastrophe.The modelling, the owner of Bluewater in Kent and Deutsche Bank’s shiny new London office, tried to explain, was more a “going concern” exercise designed to show that the balance sheet can withstand most storms.On that score, it’s almost certainly correct. Landsec has less financial leverage than most of its peers. It is spread across sectors, which is just as well since the value of its retail portfolio was slashed by a fifth. And it can even afford to throw £80m into a relief fund for struggling small retail tenants to keep them alive.Vodafone can clearly afford to dish out €2.4bn (£2.1bn) to shareholders. It may be losing out on roaming charges, but data usage is up during lockdown, so revenues are roughly predictable. In a rarity for FTSE 100 companies these days, it dared to offer a financial forecast for the current year: free cashflow will be “at least €5bn”, so not wildly different from the €5.7bn recorded in the 12 months to March. The idend arithmetic works.Instead, the main corporate action will be a long-planned spin-off of the European towers and masts infrastructure, where valuations have held up because of utility-like cashflows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/691c3c3507def57201d5f3d1c15ba414bcd8d43a/0_102_5102_3061/master/5102.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdd7f259c7bd661c128c49e6743c4645","title":"coronavirus education pandemic natural world ecology","story":"The pandemic is a tough lesson in the workings of the natural world – and proves how vital a knowledge of ecology really isImagine mentioning William Shakespeare to a university graduate and discovering they had never heard of him. You would be incredulous. But it’s common and acceptable not to know what an arthropod is, or a vertebrate, or to be unable to explain the difference between an insect and spider. No one is embarrassed when a “well-educated” person cannot provide even a rough explanation of the greenhouse effect, the carbon cycle or the water cycle, or of how soils form.All this is knowledge as basic as being aware that Shakespeare was a playwright. Yet ignorance of such earthy matters sometimes seems to be worn as a badge of sophistication. I love Shakespeare, and I believe the world would be a poorer and a sadder place without him. But we would survive. The issues about which most people live in ignorance are, by contrast, matters of life and death.I don’t blame anyone for not knowing. This is a collective failure: a crashing lapse in education, that is designed for a world in which we no longer live. The way we are taught misleads us about who we are and where we stand. In mainstream economics, for example, humankind is at the centre of the universe, and the constraints of the natural world are either invisible or marginal to the models.In an age in which we urgently need to cooperate, we are educated for inidual success in competition with others. Governments tell us that the purpose of education is to get ahead of other people or, collectively, of other nations. The success of universities is measured partly by the starting salaries of their graduates. But nobody wins the human race. What we are encouraged to see as economic success ultimately means planetary ruin.Large numbers of people now reject this approach to learning – and to life. A survey reported this week suggests that six out of 10 people in the UK want the government to prioritise health and wellbeing ahead of growth when we emerge from the pandemic. This is one of the most hopeful results I have seen in years.I believe that education should work outwards from our principal challenges and aims. This doesn’t mean we should forget Shakespeare, or the other wonders of art and culture, but that the matters crucial to our continued survival are given the weight they deserve. During the lockdown, I’ve been doing something I’ve long dreamed about: experimenting with an ecological education.I can’t claim to have found it easy, or to have got it all right. As millions of parents have discovered, there’s a reason why people undergo years of specialist education and training before qualifying as teachers. Persuading children to see you as a parent one moment and a teacher the next is especially challenging. But, working with an eight- and a nine-year-old (my youngest daughter and her best friend), I’ve begun to discover that my dream is not entirely ridiculous.I’m not talking about teaching ecology as an isolated subject, but about something more fundamental: placing ecology and Earth systems at the heart of learning, just as they are at the heart of life. So we’ve been experimenting with project-based learning, centred on the living world. We started by constructing a giant painting, composed of 15 A4 panels. Each panel introduces a different habitat, from mountaintops to the deepest ocean, the forest canopy to the soil, on to which we stick pictures of the relevant wildlife.The painting becomes a platform for exploring the processes and relationships in every ecosystem, and across the Earth system as a whole. These, in turn, are keys that open other doors. For example, rainforest ecology leads to photosynthesis, that leads to organic chemistry, atoms and molecules, to the carbon cycle, fossil fuels, energy and power. Sea otters take us to food webs, keystone species and trophic cascades.We’ve done some fieldwork in soil ecology, an extraordinary and neglected subject, upon which all human life depends. You can study it at home or in the park. It introduces basic scientific principles and experimental design, which then – as we compare and record the results from different samples – leads us into various aspects of maths and writing.We’re now making a model landscape, to demonstrate the water cycle, river dynamics, stratigraphy, erosion, soil formation and temperature gradients. To the greatest extent possible, I’m letting the children guide this journey. But because of the circular nature of Earth systems, it doesn’t matter where you begin: eventually you go all the way round. As on many previous occasions, I’m struck by children’s natural affinity with the living world. The stories it has to tell are inherently fascinating.There’s nothing radical about the things we’re learning: it’s a matter of emphasis more than content – of centralising what is most important. Now, perhaps, we have an opportunity to rethink the entire basis of education. As local authorities in Scotland point out, outdoor learning could be the best means of getting children back to school, as it permits physical distancing. It lends itself to re-engagement with the living world. But, despite years of research demonstrating its many benefits, the funding for outdoor education and adventure learning has been cut to almost nothing.This is the time for a Great Reset. Let’s use it to change the way we see ourselves and our place on Earth. The conservationist Aldo Leopold once wrote that “one of the penalties of an ecological education is that one lives alone in a world of wounds. Much of the damage inflicted on land is quite invisible to laymen.” But if everyone has an ecological education, we will not live alone, and it will not be a world of wounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e3b99d1ec3646ddc6b2d8790cc5213afa9a8989/268_193_4677_2807/master/4677.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a8a83223559caac0035f7fd8ef8f450","title":"tories lockdown social distancing testing second wave coronavirus","story":"Easing social distancing without a proper programme of testing, contact tracing and isolating will lead to a second wave of coronavirusThere are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, contact tracing and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.It’s almost impossible to decipher which path the UK government has chosen. Over the past months, its response has vacillated from the third approach to the second and, more recently, to the first. While Boris Johnson’s address on 10 May made clear he has recognised the dire position in which the UK finds itself, the government’s confusing new advice – that people should “stay alert” to the virus, work from home when possible, but go to work if working from home isn’t possible – exemplified the mixed messages coming from the government.The confusion turns on an internal struggle between two opposing camps. The first seems to think the government should attempt to get over the worst of the pandemic by allowing the virus to spread through the population, albeit at a slower pace to ease the strain on the NHS, and by creating more hospital and mortuary capacity to cope with a spike in deaths. The second camp wants to drive down the number of coronavirus cases and reduce the rate of infection – or R – to as close to zero as possible. It recognises the uniquely dangerous nature of this virus, and the emerging evidence that it can cause long-term health complications in survivors and that immunity may only be temporary.These are clearly two different goals, with two different strategies behind them. The confused messaging from the government is a worrying illustration of the lack of consensus on which of these objectives and strategies should be adopted, both within Westminster and across the four nations.But this debate misses a more fundamental point: containment (the first path) is the best strategy for public health, the economy and society. The decision in early March to shift from containing to mitigating the virus was disastrous on all three of these fronts. By the time the government introduced a lockdown, the number of coronavirus cases had already increased exponentially, making prolonged quarantine necessary.Now, the key challenge facing the government is to replace this lockdown with a package of public health interventions involving mass testing, surveillance and real-time data to identify clusters of the virus and quarantine those who are infected. This will mean providing adequate PPE to those who need it, enforcing border controls and instigating a phased relaxation of social-distancing measures. Rather than putting everyone under lockdown, these measures would give health authorities information about the spread of the virus, allowing them to identify hotspots and target interventions where they’re needed.Without these measures in place, the past seven weeks of lockdown will have been completely pointless. As quarantine measures are lifted, the virus will continue to spread, the number of daily cases will rise and a second peak will become inevitable. Everyone agrees that we need to get out of the lockdown as soon as possible, but doing so will require massive investment in public health infrastructure. Countries such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia have already built this capacity, allowing them to ease measures while retaining control over the virus and identifying who has it, who has had it and who could be exposed to it.The social costs of lockdown are severe. Seven weeks in, we’ve witnessed the increased use of food banks, delayed care for those needing NHS services, the closure of schools, rising cases of domestic abuse and bankruptcy among small-business owners. So why has the government made such little progress in building the public health infrastructure necessary to control the virus and ease the lockdown? You could be forgiven for thinking that the lockdown was simply a way to reassure the public that the government was “doing something”. We need to be asking: what measures has the government put in place to ensure we’re in a better position to release the lockdown and prevent a second wave?Everyone wants to know when the lockdown will end and life will go back to “normal”. The better question to ask is how we ease lockdown measures in the coming months and years while preventing a second wave of infections and keeping R well below one. There are a number of endings to this story. First, an accessible and affordable vaccine could become available within the next 18 months second, the government could embark on a resource-intensive and gruelling campaign to eliminate the virus, particularly if emerging data proves coronavirus is as dangerous as diseases such as smallpox and polio or third, antiviral therapies could become available to treat Covid-19 that make it a mild illness, so the population would gradually and safely build up natural herd immunity. But on our current path we seem destined for a disastrous ending. Lifting lockdown without the public health infrastructure in place to contain the virus will allow Covid-19 to spread through the population unchecked. The result could be a Darwinian culling of the elderly and vulnerable, and an inidual gamble for those exposed to the virus. This should be avoided at all costs.• Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c527fb1136fc03cda6f73a889c5b531e3b94406a/0_93_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e68ac842eac2c45383a91f3815cd54cc","title":"plans to reopen schools on 1 june in jeopardy as education unions tell staff not to engage with prepartions 1","story":"UK government proposals, including class sizes of 15, branded unfeasible by unionsGovernment plans to reopen schools in England face a mounting backlash from education unions, who say the proposals are not feasible and have advised teachers and support staff not to “engage with” preparations for a 1 June return.The Department for Education (DfE) wants children back in primary schools in a phased reopening starting next month, with class sizes limited to 15 and a staggered timetable to limit the number of pupils and risk of transmission.The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has held regular meetings with sector leaders to try to keep teachers onboard, but relations appeared to be fraying on Tuesday with unions complaining they were not consulted on the 1 June return date or the year groups chosen to return first.The National Education Union (NEU), which represents 450,000 teachers and other school staff, and the public service union Unison, representing school support staff, told members not to engage with planning for reopening on 1 June.The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, meanwhile raised concerns about the potential safety risks. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour, she said: “I would be more than happy to send my own child to school if I knew that by doing so I would not be potentially harming others. That’s the critical issue for me. And we don’t have that evidence, I feel, currently.”The government has said it wants children in reception, year 1 and year 6 to be back in school first, with other primary years joining later, but headteachers have raised concerns about problems with physical distancing for younger children and health risks for pupils and staff.Kevin Courtney, NEU joint general secretary, tweeted to members: “Education unions intend to work together. Don’t engage with planning a June 1 return to wider opening – await further union advice.” Schools are currently closed to all pupils other than children of key workers and vulnerable pupils.The NEU says that, under health and safety legislation, any employees – including teachers – are protected if they believe they will be exposed to a serious and imminent danger should they attend their place of work.“If such a situation does arise in a school or college, our members will continue working from home as they have been over the last six weeks,” the union said.Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, agreed there could be no compromise on health and safety.“If this means that schools are unable to open safely before September because they are unable to make arrangements to safeguard their staff and pupils, then that position must be accepted.”Geoff Barton, meanwhile, who is general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, described government ambitions for school reopening as “frankly unfathomable”.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told MPs on the education select committee on Tuesday that primary schools would struggle to accommodate classes of 15 with physical distancing requirements.“Our members are telling us that their building sizes on average would only accommodate classes of 10 to 12, rather than 15,” he said.“So straight away we’re getting into some real practical difficulties about whether the government’s ambition can be practically accommodated. Let alone all the fears that parents have about bringing their children back into school, and the fears of the workforce too.”Williamson said: “The latest scientific advice indicates it will be safe for more children to return to school from 1 June, but we will continue to limit the overall numbers in school and introduce protective measures to prevent transmission.“This marks the first step towards having all young people back where they belong – in nurseries, schools and colleges – but we will continue to be led by the scientific evidence and will only take further steps when the time is right.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ed05b9defa95c7b5ec396143c37cd5abc75c6d5/0_474_5544_3326/master/5544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fcfe858b692ed704ea6f71db7f22d66","title":"uk takeaway food waste rises during coronavirus lockdown","story":"Survey shows food waste generated has risen from £111 to £148 per restaurant per weekFood waste generated by UK restaurants dishing up takeaways during the lockdown has risen as a result of consumers’ “unpredictable ordering patterns” during the pandemic, research has revealed.Unusual fluctuations in demand have led to an increase in food waste generated in takeaway outlets rising from an average of £111 per restaurant per week in normal times to £148 – equivalent to a £16.7m rise for the sector as a whole since lockdown, according to the research.Britain’s fondness for takeaway food has created a £5bn-a-year business that has ballooned in the past decade. In recent weeks, the options have expanded as many restaurants have turned to takeout and delivery as an alternative to closure.The research from the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA) and the Just Eat app was conducted in two waves – the first in December 2019, followed by a second phase in April to understand how attitudes towards food waste had changed due to the pandemic.The 2019 data found that a total of £1.8bn worth of takeaway food was thrown away in the UK.

But he hopes the crisis might ease political tensions over vaccines and force anti-vaccine campaigners to re-evaluate their positions, as well as lead to reform of the World Health Organization (WHO).In his first interview since contracting the virus, the professor said he started to display symptoms on 19 March when he developed a high fever and a sharp headache.He had other symptoms, not then linked to coronavirus. “My skull and hair felt very painful, which was bizarre,” he said in an interview with the Belgian magazine Knack, a version of which was published in English in Science magazine.He did not have a cough at the time but his instinct told him it was coronavirus. He thought it would pass and he continued to work as a special adviser to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.To be hospitalised by a virus after four decades avoiding the infectious diseases he studies was not something he expected.“I have devoted my life to fighting viruses and finally, they get their revenge. For a week I balanced between heaven and earth, on the edge of what could have been the end,” he said.“I had never been seriously ill and have not taken a day of sick leave the past 10 years. I live a pretty healthy life and walk regularly. The only risk factor for corona is my age – I’m 71. I’m an optimist, so I thought it would pass.” Piot was one of the leading critics of the UK, UN and WHO’s response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa in 2014, which he called “too slow”. After two weeks of self-isolating, Piot ended up in hospital.The professor had perilously low oxygen levels, a phenomenon of coronavirus in which patients present with no breathlessness or distress but have oxygen saturation scores low enough to typically cause unconsciousness.“Lung images showed I had severe pneumonia, typical of Covid-19, as well as bacterial pneumonia. I constantly felt exhausted, while normally I’m always buzzing with energy. It wasn’t just fatigue, but complete exhaustion I’ll never forget that feeling. I had to be hospitalised, although I tested negative for the virus in the meantime. This is also typical for Covid-19: the virus disappears, but its consequences linger for weeks,” he said.“I was concerned I would be put on a ventilator immediately because I had seen publications showing it increases your chance of dying. I was pretty scared, but fortunately, they just gave me an oxygen mask first and that turned out to work. So, I ended up in an isolation room in the antechamber of the intensive care department.“I shared a room with a homeless person, a Colombian cleaner, and a man from Bangladesh – all three diabetics, incidentally, which is consistent with the known picture of the disease. The days and nights were lonely because no one had the energy to talk. I could only whisper for weeks even now, my voice loses power in the evening. But I always had that question going around in my head: how will I be when I get out of this?” He was released after a week but was back in hospital days later.He had an “organising pneumonia-induced lung disease, caused by a so-called cytokine storm”. He added: “It’s a result of your immune defence going into overdrive.” Piot is still recovering and warns that the more we learn about the virus, the more questions arise. “There will be hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, possibly more, who will need treatments such as renal dialysis for the rest of their lives,” he predicted.“We are learning while we are sailing. That’s why I get so annoyed by the many commentators on the sidelines who, without much insight, criticise the scientists and policymakers trying hard to get the epidemic under control. That’s very unfair.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/468b4a1454b699489f70d3161798d897e516a461/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbf4094ab1df99c850c6010256673578","title":"need help with home schooling 12 of the best apps if youre teaching kids in lockdown","story":"If it’s years since you were last in a classroom, don’t despair.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people.

To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen’s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet’s Tamara Rojo’s Facebook classes.Online rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.In recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

There are lots of different channels you can look at, so I just go by which one looks the best for what I want to draw. It can be anything, perhaps a doughnut, and the tutorial will show you how to do a doughnut with some cute eyes on it.“I like craft and baking videos too, but painting is what I like the most. I’ve painted loads of things. My grandma is a good painter, she painted a picture of her house and it looked exactly like it.”Mason Crawford, eight“There’s this app called Times Table Rock Stars, where you’re constantly doing maths – it’s like a maths machine. They’ll give you a question, like 7 x 11, and you’ve got to get it really quickly, and then the next question comes. The better you do, the more of a rock star you become, so you start off as a support act, and build up to a rock hero.“I’m a regular rock star at the moment, which means I can answer questions in under three seconds, and my sister is a headliner, the level below. I didn’t really know my times tables before the game, but now I do and it’s so much fun. And you can challenge your teacher. I did that once but, well, who do you think won? I beat my mum and dad, though.”Michael Gouveia, eight“I love ScratchGarden for learning maths because it is really fun and there’s cool rap music I can dance to. I love counting by twos, threes and fours, all the way to 10s and 100s, because the rhymes make it easier to remember. So I’m dancing and singing when I’m learning my numbers. It’s like music therapy too as it helps me relax. I love the rocket ship and the dancing robot.“I even let my little brother Raphael join me, as he dances too and then claps for me when the song is finished. As a treat I watch the Scratch Garden Bloopers afterwards, which have jokes and puzzles about a salamander. It really makes me laugh.”James Follen, 13“I’m using my gaming platform, an Xbox One, to keep in touch with my friends during this time. We play games such as Minecraft and Sea of Thieves. We are able to chat and mess around while playing and it’s similar to phoning your friends, but instead of lying on the sofa we are interacting with each other in the virtual world. We talk about family, school and lockdown while also building houses, surviving or journeying on missions.”Kaci Gibson, 12“Futbin is an app that’s great for discovering up-and-coming football players and their potential.“It’s pretty cool knowing quite a lot about football. I’d say I’m pretty much a football encyclopedia – ask me something and I’ll know it.“My favourite stat at the moment is that Manchester City have no fans, well not enough! They can’t fill their stadium as they just don’t have a good fanbase. Sadly, Liverpool always sell out and Man United do most of the time.“England are best for women’s football. USA are pretty good, but England, yeah. I prefer women’s international football over men’s. The men don’t get anywhere in tournaments for one, and, second, they just roll around on the floor like babies.”Indy Williams, six“Waffle and Friends is a game about a dog, and I love it. I go on to CBeebies games and use the keys on the computer – you know, the up, down and side ones – to explore around Mrs Hobbs’ house, but you can go to other places too. Waffle has friends, one is a cat called George, and they can go into each other’s houses.“There are people who need stuff, like Gramps needs a microphone, and it’ll be hidden in the house.

It said the majority of these sales were agreed between November 2019 and February 2020, and would have been set to complete between April and June.Under amendments to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) regulations in England, a reasonable excuse for being away from home will be expanded to include visiting estate or letting agents, viewing residential properties, preparing a residential property to move in or sell, or moving home.Buyers, renters, sellers and estate agents are likely to have to take extra precautions, including keeping 2 metres apart during viewings.It comes after Boris Johnson said on Sunday night that the government was now “actively encouraging” people to get back to work as part of the first steps to restarting the economy.Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, said removal companies, conveyancers and estate agents could restart their businesses with immediate effect. He said the government estimated that more than 450,000 buyers and renters had been unable to progress their plans to move since March.“Our clear plan will enable people to move home safely, covering each aspect of the sales and letting process from viewings to removals,” Jenrick said. “Our step-by-step plan is based on the latest guidance to ensure the safety and protection of everyone involved.“This critical industry can now safely move forward, and those waiting patiently to move can now do so.”The cabinet minister also unveiled new guidance to allow extended working hours on construction sites and to make the planning system operate remotely.He said builders would be able to agree more flexible construction site working hours with their local council, such as staggering arrival times to ease pressure on public transport.Construction companies signing up to a new charter will have to commit to returning their employees to work safely, including working with their subcontractors to implement social distancing and staggered start times, as well as safe working practices.Estate agents will now be braced for a surge in inquiries, and a potential exodus to the countryside.Last week they reported a increase in would-be homebuyers planning to move out of cities to rural areas or smaller places – including Scottish fishing villages and English market towns – as people concluded that home working was here to stay, or dreamed of a different pace of life.Andrew Perratt, head of country residential at Savills, said it might be easy to dismiss an increase in web visits as largely being down to “bored dreamers” at home surfing the internet. But he added: “What is most significant for me is the jump in new buyer registrations.” He said the big demand was for properties in “the country markets around the major cities”, which included villages and market towns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/320ed88753a825e3b6f5c7bb09e8fbf5da371d2f/421_0_4063_2438/master/4063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e8110b7370f0b5f871f7a6d688f547","title":"it was no holiday when sainsburys took a loan payment after it said it wouldnt","story":"But there’s better news for travellers, as Eurostar and BA ease coronavirus refund policiesA few years ago I took out a £20,000 loan with Sainsbury’s Bank to pay for debts I had accrued over a lean time of work. I pay back £400 a month and still owe £10,000. All my freelance work has dried up due to the shutdown and I applied for universal credit.I contacted Sainsbury’s Bank about taking a payment holiday but all it would do was delay my next payment by a month. But despite agreeing, it still took the £400 payment. This emptied my account and led to my card being declined while food shopping.When I called to complain, the only solution offered was to make an indemnity claim on the payment with my bank but then I’d be in arrears on the loan.At the start of the crisis, the Financial Conduct Authority was quick to tell loan providers to offer consumers a three-month payment freeze. It seems, in your case, the person processing your call simply didn’t apply this. At least after we took your case, Sainsbury’s Bank moved quickly to put it right. It has now apologised, applied the full three-month payment holiday, refunded the £6 overdraft fee and will pay you a further £125 for distress and inconvenience.Better news for those looking for travel refunds. Eurostar this week announced more generous cancellation terms and has promised cash refunds.Previously, it was pushing customers into taking vouchers that had to be used to make a booking before the end of September for travel by the end of April 2021.After many complaints, it has said customers have 12 months to make a new booking, and a further six months to travel to its “core” city destinations – or nine months to its seasonal stations such as Disneyland Paris or the south of France.Passengers have complained that trains were cancelled only 48 hours before they were set to depart, in an apparent bid to get customers to accept vouchers rather than refunds. The advice is not to do anything until the day before you were due to travel, if you want a cash refund.Meanwhile, readers who bought flight tickets, but paid using PayPal rather than a credit card, have reported getting full refunds for cancelled flights. SH writes: “I supplied the correspondence from Ryanair – the cancellation plus original email offering a refund and subsequent one offering a voucher – and I received notification that the money was back in my PayPal credit account within a week. Hope this helps others in the same boat.”BA customers are now reporting being offered refunds, too, after phoning the company.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Within this, more than 6 million workers have been furloughed, or almost a quarter of all employees. More than 1.5 million more may potentially have lost their jobs, judging by new universal credit claims.This means about a third of the UK workforce are currently either under-employed or unemployed. These are historically unprecedented levels of inactivity. And this is, inevitably, taking its toll on household finances.The loss of their job, or a fall in the number of hours they work, means that millions of households are facing a cut, often a significant one, in their take-home pay. That is despite the cushioning effects of the government’s furlough scheme, the mortgage holidays extended by banks and other important initiatives to support household incomes.This hit to household finances is being compounded by a second crisis. This crisis does not have anything like the immediacy or severity of the Covid-19 crisis, but is much longer-lived and risks making a precarious financial situation treacherous for many households. This is the UK’s numeracy crisis.Remarkably, about half of the UK adult population have numeracy skills that are no better than those of a primary school child. Worse still, number skills across the UK appear to be deteriorating over time. The UK is the only OECD country where levels of numeracy among those aged 16-24 are lower than those aged 55-64.It is well-evidenced that numeracy and financial literacy are intimately interlinked. Without confidence in numbers, it is very difficult for people to navigate their finances, whether it is drawing up a weekly balance sheet of incomings and outgoings, or understanding the annual percentage rate (APR) on their loans. In my travels across the UK, it is clear the numeracy crisis is adding greatly to levels of debt and depression.That bodes ill when it comes to managing the hit to finances currently facing millions of households. The half of the population least confident with numbers are also most likely to suffer the largest hit to their incomes. As the twin crises have collided, the poor, the young and the most vulnerable households are left facing double jeopardy.Yet, at the same time, these twin crises may also present an opportunity – an opportunity to improve people’s number skills in a way that would in turn help them navigate the financial rapids they are currently facing.Today is National Numeracy Day, the third festival of numbers organised by the charity National Numeracy (of which I am vice-chair). As well as raising awareness of the UK’s numeracy crisis, the charity offer tools to improve people’s number skills and confidence including the National Numeracy Challenge. Give it a go it takes only 10 minutes.You can see if your maths skills match your expectations, and if not get practical advice. It is about understanding percentages, spotting best-buy deals and making the most of your money, not algebra and trigonometry.Taking the challenge – as 300,000 people have already done – demonstrates, conclusively, that there is no such thing as having a “maths brain”. We all do it just needs the tools and the time to make it tick.In normal times, with demanding jobs and lives, it is hard for people to find the time (and the inclination) to brush up on their number skills. And there is evidence some people may systematically overestimate their ability with numbers. But these times are anything but normal. Facing stretched finances, and with at least some people having a larger-than-normal amount of time on their hands, a window of opportunity may have opened to invest just a little bit of that time in number skills.This could help households steer a safe course through the current financial rocks. It would develop the workplace skills useful for jobs and pay rises. And, for those like myself with school-age children, it might even help alleviate the daily stress of acting as a part-time maths teacher.We are often told never to waste a crisis. Facing twin crises, we should use one to help ease the stress on the other.

By  Naomi KleinFor a few fleeting moments during the New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s daily coronavirus briefing on Wednesday 6 May, the sombre grimace that has filled our screens for weeks was briefly replaced by something resembling a smile.“We are ready, we’re all-in,” the governor gushed. “We are New Yorkers, so we’re aggressive about it, we’re ambitious about it … We realise that change is not only imminent, but it can actually be a friend if done the right way.”The inspiration for these uncharacteristically good vibes was a video visit from the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who joined the governor’s briefing to announce that he will be heading up a panel to reimagine New York state’s post-Covid reality, with an emphasis on permanently integrating technology into every aspect of civic life.“The first priorities of what we’re trying to do,” Schmidt said, “are focused on telehealth, remote learning, and broadband … We need to look for solutions that can be presented now, and accelerated, and use technology to make things better.” Lest there be any doubt that the former Google chair’s goals were purely benevolent, his video background featured a framed pair of golden angel wings.It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent – and highly profitable – no-touch future.Anuja Sonalker, the CEO of Steer Tech, a Maryland-based company selling self-parking technology, recently summed up the new virus-personalised pitch. “There has been a distinct warming up to humanless, contactless technology,” she said. “Humans are biohazards, machines are not.”It’s a future in which our homes are never again exclusively personal spaces, but are also, via high-speed digital connectivity, our schools, our doctor’s offices, our gyms, and, if determined by the state, our jails. Of course, for many of us, those same homes were already turning into our never-off workplaces and our primary entertainment venues before the pandemic, and surveillance incarceration “in the community” was already booming. But in the future that is hastily being constructed, all of these trends are poised for a warp-speed acceleration.This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen “shared” on a mediated platform. It’s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It’s a future that claims to be run on “artificial intelligence”, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It’s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.If all of this sounds familiar, it’s because, pre-Covid, this precise app-driven, gig-fuelled future was being sold to us in the name of friction-free convenience and personalisation. But many of us had concerns. About the security, quality and inequity of telehealth and online classrooms. About driverless cars mowing down pedestrians and drones smashing packages (and people). About location tracking and cash-free commerce obliterating our privacy and entrenching racial and gender discrimination. About unscrupulous social media platforms poisoning our information ecology and our kids’ mental health. About “smart cities” filled with sensors supplanting local government. About the good jobs these technologies wiped out. About the bad jobs they mass produced.And most of all, we had concerns about the democracy-threatening wealth and power accumulated by a handful of tech companies that are masters of abdication – eschewing all responsibility for the wreckage left behind in the fields they now dominate, whether media, retail or transportation.That was the ancient past, also known as February. Today, a great many of those well-founded concerns are being swept away by a tidal wave of panic, and this warmed-over dystopia is going through a rush-job rebranding. Now, against a harrowing backdrop of mass death, it is being sold to us on the dubious promise that these technologies are the only possible way to pandemic-proof our lives, the indispensable keys to keeping ourselves and our loved ones safe.Thanks to Cuomo and his various billionaire partnerships (including one with Michael Bloomberg for testing and tracing), New York state is being positioned as the gleaming showroom for this grim future – but the ambitions reach far beyond the borders of any one state or country.And at the dead centre of it all is Eric Schmidt.Well before Americans understood the threat of Covid-19, Schmidt had been on an aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, pushing precisely the Black Mirror vision of society that Cuomo has just empowered him to build. At the heart of this vision is seamless integration of government with a handful of Silicon Valley giants – with public schools, hospitals, doctor’s offices, police and military all outsourcing (at a high cost) many of their core functions to private tech companies.It’s a vision Schmidt has been advancing in his roles as chair of the Defense Innovation Board, which advises the US Department of Defense on increased use of artificial intelligence in the military, and as chair of the powerful National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, or NSCAI, which advises Congress on “advances in artificial intelligence, related machine learning developments and associated technologies”, with the goal of addressing “the national and economic security needs of the United States, including economic risk”. Both boards are crowded with powerful Silicon Valley CEOs and top executives from companies including Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and of course, Schmidt’s former colleagues at Google.As chair, Schmidt – who still holds more than $5.3bn in shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company), as well as large investments in other tech firms – has essentially been running a Washington-based shakedown on behalf of Silicon Valley. The main purpose of the two boards is to call for exponential increases in government spending on research into artificial intelligence and on tech-enabling infrastructure such as 5G – investments that would directly benefit the companies in which Schmidt and other members of these boards have extensive holdings.First in closed-door presentations to lawmakers, and later in public-facing opinion articles and interviews, the thrust of Schmidt’s argument has been that since the Chinese government is willing to spend limitless public money building the infrastructure of high-tech surveillance, while allowing Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei to pocket the profits from commercial applications, the US’s dominant position in the global economy is on the precipice of collapsing.The Electronic Privacy Information Center (Epic) recently got access, through a freedom of information (FOI) request, to a presentation made by Schmidt’s NSCAI in May 2019. Its slides make a series of alarmist claims about how China’s relatively lax regulatory infrastructure and its bottomless appetite for surveillance are causing it to pull ahead of the US in a number of fields, including “AI for medical diagnosis”, autonomous vehicles, digital infrastructure, “smart cities”, ride-sharing and cashless commerce.The reasons given for China’s competitive edge are myriad, ranging from the sheer volume of consumers who shop online “the lack of legacy banking systems in China”, which has allowed it to leapfrog over cash and credit cards and unleash “a huge e-commerce and digital services market” using digital payments and a severe doctor shortage, which has led the government to work closely with tech companies such as Tencent to use AI for “predictive” medicine. The slides note that in China, tech companies “have the authority to quickly clear regulatory barriers, while American initiatives are mired in HIPPA compliance and FDA approval”.More than any other factor, however, the NSCAI points to China’s willingness to embrace public-private partnerships in mass surveillance and data collection as a reason for its competitive edge. The presentation touts China’s “Explicit government support and involvement eg facial recognition deployment”. It argues that “surveillance is one of the ‘first-and-best customers’ for Al” and further, that “mass surveillance is a killer application for deep learning”.A slide titled “State Datasets: Surveillance  Smart Cities” notes that China, along with Google’s main Chinese competitor, Alibaba, are racing ahead.This is notable because Google’s parent company, Alphabet, has been pushing this precise vision through its Sidewalk Labs ision, choosing a large portion of Toronto’s waterfront as its “smart city” prototype. But the Toronto project was just shut down after two years of ceaseless controversy relating to the enormous amounts of personal data that Alphabet would collect, a lack of privacy protections, and questionable benefits for the city as a whole.Five months after this presentation, in November, NSCAI issued an interim report to Congress further raising the alarm about the need for the US to match China’s adaptation of these controversial technologies. “We are in a strategic competition,” states the report, obtained via FOI by Epic. “AI will be at the centre. The future of our national security and economy are at stake.”By late February, Schmidt was taking his campaign to the public, perhaps understanding that the budget increases his board was calling for could not be approved without a great deal more buy-in. In a New York Times article headlined “I used to Run Google. Silicon Valley Could Lose to China”, Schmidt called for “unprecedented partnerships between government and industry” and, once again sounding the yellow peril alarm, wrote:“AI will open new frontiers in everything from biotechnology to banking, and it is also a defense department priority … If current trends continue, China’s overall investments in research and development are expected to surpass those of the United States within 10 years, around the same time its economy is projected to become larger than ours.Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a country that has a bigger economy, more research and development investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies and stronger computing infrastructure … Ultimately, the Chinese are competing to become the world’s leading innovators, and the United States is not playing to win.”The only solution, for Schmidt, was a gush of public money. Praising the White House for requesting a doubling of research funding in AI and quantum information science, he wrote: “We should plan to double funding in those fields again as we build institutional capacity in labs and research centres … At the same time, Congress should meet the president’s request for the highest level of defence R \u0026amp D funding in over 70 years, and the defense department should capitalise on that resource surge to build breakthrough capabilities in AI, quantum, hypersonics and other priority technology areas.”That was exactly two weeks before the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, and there was no mention that a goal of this vast, hi-tech expansion was to protect American health. Only that it was necessary to avoid being outcompeted by China. But, of course, that would soon change.In the two months since, Schmidt has put these pre-existing demands – for massive public expenditures on high-tech research and infrastructure, for a slew of “public-private partnerships” in AI, and for the loosening of myriad privacy and safety protections – through an aggressive rebranding exercise. Now all of these measures (and more) are being sold to the public as our only possible hope of protecting ourselves from a novel virus that will be with us for years to come.And the tech companies to which Schmidt has deep ties, and which populate the influential advisory boards he chairs, have all repositioned themselves as benevolent protectors of public health and munificent champions of “everyday hero” essential workers (many of whom, like delivery drivers, would lose their jobs if these companies get their way). Less than two weeks into New York state’s lockdown, Schmidt wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal that both set the new tone and made clear that Silicon Valley had every intention of leveraging the crisis for a permanent transformation.“Like other Americans, technologists are trying to do their part to support the front-line pandemic response …But every American should be asking where we want the nation to be when the Covid-19 pandemic is over. How could the emerging technologies being deployed in the current crisis propel us into a better future? … Companies like Amazon know how to supply and distribute efficiently. They will need to provide services and advice to government officials who lack the computing systems and expertise.We should also accelerate the trend toward remote learning, which is being tested today as never before. Online, there is no requirement of proximity, which allows students to get instruction from the best teachers, no matter what school district they reside in …The need for fast, large-scale experimentation will also accelerate the biotech revolution … Finally, the country is long overdue for a real digital infrastructure … If we are to build a future economy and education system based on tele-everything, we need a fully connected population and ultrafast infrastructure. The government must make a massive investment – perhaps as part of a stimulus package – to convert the nation’s digital infrastructure to cloud-based platforms and link them with a 5G network.”Indeed, Schmidt has been relentless in pursuing this vision. Two weeks after that article appeared, he described the ad-hoc home schooling programming that teachers and families across the country had been forced to cobble together during this public health emergency as “a massive experiment in remote learning”.The goal of this experiment, he said, was “trying to find out: how do kids learn remotely? And with that data we should be able to build better remote and distance learning tools which, when combined with the teacher … will help kids learn better.” During this same video call, hosted by the Economic Club of New York, Schmidt also called for more telehealth, more 5G, more digital commerce and the rest of the preexisting wish list. All in the name of fighting the virus.His most telling comment, however, was this: “The benefit of these corporations, which we love to malign, in terms of the ability to communicate, the ability to deal with health, the ability to get information, is profound. Think about what your life would be like in America without Amazon.” He added that people should “be a little bit grateful that these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that we’re using now, and have really helped us out”.Schmidt’s words are a reminder that until very recently, public pushback against these companies was surging. Presidential candidates were openly discussing breaking up big tech. Amazon was forced to pull its plans for a New York headquarters because of fierce local opposition. Google’s Sidewalk Labs project was in perennial crisis, and Google workers were refusing to build surveillance tech with military applications.In short, democracy – inconvenient public engagement in the designing of critical institutions and public spaces – was turning out to be the single greatest obstacle to the vision Schmidt was advancing, first from his perch at the top of Google and Alphabet, and then as chair of two powerful boards advising US Congress and the Department of Defense. As the NSCAI documents reveal, this inconvenient exercise of power by members of the public and by tech workers inside these mega-firms has, from the perspective of men such as Schmidt and the Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, maddeningly slowed down the AI arms race, keeping fleets of potentially deadly driverless cars and trucks off the roads, protecting private health records from becoming a weapon used by employers against workers, preventing urban spaces from being blanketing with facial recognition software, and much more.Now, in the midst of the carnage of this ongoing pandemic, and the fear and uncertainty about the future it has brought, these companies clearly see their moment to sweep out all that democratic engagement. To have the same kind of power as their Chinese competitors, who have the luxury of functioning without being hampered by intrusions of either labour or civil rights.All of this is moving very fast. The Australian government has contracted with Amazon to store the data for its controversial coronavirus tracking app. The Canadian government has contracted with Amazon to deliver medical equipment, raising questions about why it bypassed the public postal service. And in just a few short days in early May, Alphabet has spun up a new Sidewalk Labs initiative to remake urban infrastructure with $400m in seed capital. Josh Marcuse, the executive director of the Defense Innovation Board chaired by Schmidt, announced that he was leaving that job to work full-time at Google as head of strategy and innovation for global public sector, meaning that he will be helping Google to cash in on some of the many opportunities he and Schmidt have been busily creating with their lobbying.To be clear, technology is most certainly a key part of how we must protect public health in the coming months and years. The question is: will that technology be subject to the disciplines of democracy and public oversight, or will it be rolled out in state-of-exception frenzy, without asking critical questions that will shape our lives for decades to come? Questions such as these, for instance: if we are indeed seeing how critical digital connectivity is in times of crisis, should these networks, and our data, really be in the hands of private players such as Google, Amazon and Apple? If public funds are paying for so much of it, should the public also own and control it? If the internet is essential for so much in our lives, as it clearly is, should it be treated as a nonprofit public utility?And while there is no doubt that the ability to teleconference has been a lifeline in this period of lockdown, there are serious debates to be had about whether our more lasting protections are distinctly more human. Take education. Schmidt is right that overcrowded classrooms present a health risk, at least until we have a vaccine. So how about hiring double the number of teachers and cutting class size in half? How about making sure that every school has a nurse?That would create much-needed jobs in a depression-level unemployment crisis, and give everyone in the learning environment more elbow room. If buildings are too crowded, how about iding the day into shifts, and having more outdoor education, drawing on the plentiful research that shows that time in nature enhances children’s capacity to learn?Introducing those kinds of changes would be hard, to be sure. But they are not nearly as risky as giving up on the tried-and-true technology of trained humans teaching younger humans face-to-face, in groups where they learn to socialise with one another to boot.Upon learning of New York state’s new partnership with the Gates Foundation, Andy Pallotta, the president of the New York State United Teachers union, was quick to react: “If we want to reimagine education, let’s start with addressing the need for social workers, mental health counsellors, school nurses, enriching arts courses, advanced courses and smaller class sizes in school districts across the state,” he said. A coalition of parents’ groups also pointed out that if they had indeed been living an “experiment in remote learning” (as Schmidt put it), then the results were deeply worrying: “Since the schools were shut down in mid-March, our understanding of the profound deficiencies of screen-based instruction has only grown.”In addition to the obvious class and race biases against children who lack internet access and home computers (problems that tech companies are eager to be paid to solve with massive tech buys), there are big questions about whether remote teaching can serve many kids with disabilities, as required by law. And there is no technological solution to the problem of learning in a home environment that is overcrowded andor abusive.The issue is not whether schools must change in the face of a highly contagious virus for which we have neither cure nor inoculation. Like every institution where humans gather in groups, they will change. The trouble, as always in these moments of collective shock, is the absence of public debate about what those changes should look like, and who they should benefit – private tech companies or students?The same questions need to be asked about health. Avoiding doctor’s offices and hospitals during a pandemic makes good sense. But telehealth misses a huge amount. So we need to have an evidence-based debate about the pros and cons of spending scarce public resources on telehealth – rather than on more trained nurses, equipped with all the necessary protective equipment, who are able to make house calls to diagnose and treat patients in their homes. And, perhaps most urgently, we need to get the balance right between virus tracking apps, which, with the proper privacy protections, have a role to play, and the calls for a “community health corps” that would put millions of Americans to work, not only doing contact-tracing, but making sure that everyone has the material resources and support they need to quarantine safely.In each case, we face real and hard choices between investing in humans and investing in technology. Because the brutal truth is that, as it stands, we are very unlikely to do both. The refusal to transfer anything like the needed resources to states and cities in successive federal bailouts means that the coronavirus health crisis is now slamming headlong into a manufactured austerity crisis. Public schools, universities, hospitals and transit are facing existential questions about their futures. If tech companies win their ferocious lobbying campaign for remote learning, telehealth, 5G and driverless vehicles – their Screen New Deal – there simply won’t be any money left over for urgent public priorities, never mind the Green New Deal that our planet urgently needs. On the contrary: the price tag for all the shiny gadgets will be mass teacher layoffs and hospital closures.Tech provides us with powerful tools, but not every solution is technological. And the trouble with outsourcing key decisions about how to “reimagine” our states and cities to men such as Bill Gates and Schmidt is that they have spent their lives demonstrating the belief that there is no problem that technology cannot fix.For them, and many others in Silicon Valley, the pandemic is a golden opportunity to receive not just the gratitude, but the deference and power that they feel has been unjustly denied. And Andrew Cuomo, by putting the former Google chair in charge of the body that will shape the state’s reopening, appears to have just given him something close to free rein.• Republished with permission from The Intercept.

Although the UK does not formally oppose such clauses, British diplomats are worried that in the current context it would give the US extensive and unbalanced leverage over UK policy towards China.UK diplomats are more broadly concerned that Donald Trump’s determination to use the coronavirus outbreak as a political stick with which to beat China, and secure his re-election, is going to place the UK government under intense external pressure to side with the US against China. Support for a stronger anti-China posture is growing across Conservative benches.The former chancellor George Osborne said he was nevertheless confident that Boris Johnson was not going to succumb, saying: “Curiously, the member of the cabinet most in favour of engagement with China is the prime minister. He is perfectly prepared to resist some of the pressure from his backbenches.”Osborne, speaking at a Strand Group webinar, added: “Multilateralism is a way for countries to cooperate on shared objectives. You cannot have this and side with the US in isolating China from the global system. It is the longest continuously existing civilisation in the world.”Osborne recalled that when he was chancellor, Johnson, who at the time was mayor of London, accompanied him on a trip to China and fully understood the need for cooperation with Beijing.In a Harvard Kennedy school of government paper jointly written by the former Treasury minister Ed Balls, the authors claim a full trade deal before the US presidential election in November is impossible.They also suggest even a mini-deal might present a dilemma for the UK, since it could draw it into an emerging US foreign and economic policy based on anti-China bilateralism, and so close the door on plans for a global Britain.The paper cites an unnamed UK government official saying: “The talks could conclude with a political statement that pulls the UK towards an anti-China, anti-cooperative view of the world.”It also cites a UK finance official saying: “The US government seems to want to use the pandemic to cut off China from the global economy, to onshore manufacturing and redesign the global economy, to reprioritise around security while saying you can’t have China as part of the system because of how they behave.“Is this electioneering rhetoric? Or is it potentially much more dangerous, a desire to have a different global economy where China isn’t part of the system?”A Foreign Office official is quoted saying: “The strategy is not to leave the EU and find out that the US is setting the agenda and the UK is bound to the US because of a trade deal.”Some UK officials believe there is still merit in the UK trying to reach a preliminary outline deal with China before the US presidential election, arguing it will put pressure on the EU to reach a deal with the UK by the end of the deal.They also believe the prospect of a UK deal could be used as leverage to persuade Trump to adopt a more multilateral approach to the coronavirus crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09189421d58f6499efa5b4de54761adff592dec6/0_152_4582_2751/master/4582.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=381b5522880e9a59e59f560c5854d7f0","title":"amateur archaeologists redraw map of roman britain from home","story":"Volunteers find ‘astounding’ number of unknown sites in south-west from aerial surveysDigging at archaeological sites around the UK has been brought to a shuddering halt by the coronavirus, but research being undertaken from home by a group of amateurs is helping to redraw the map of the south-west of Britain in Roman times.Volunteers poring over detailed aerial surveys of the borderlands between Cornwall and Devon spotted telltale signs of dozens of previously unknown settlements and miles of roads linking Roman forts.The project suggests areas including Bodmin Moor, in Cornwall, and Dartmoor, in Devon, were much more populous than previously had been thought.So far, less than a tenth of the material available has been studied but already 30 previously unknown settlements believed to date from between 300BC and AD300 have been found, as well as more than 20 miles of Roman road.Once the lockdown ends, the pinpointed sites will be examined in person, but until then their locations are being kept secret for fear that unscrupulous metal detectorists may head there and search for artefacts.Dr Chris Smart, a landscape archaeologist at the University of Exeter who is guiding the volunteers, said the results were astounding.“I knew we’d find some things but I didn’t think it would be so many. The types of sites are what you would expect in this region but it’s the number that is so surprising. Dozens of sites have been found already, but it will be hundreds by the time the volunteers are finished. We’re seeing a much greater density of population than we thought.”The initiative is part of a project funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund called Understanding Landscapes. Usually the project would involve volunteers out in the field carrying out survey work or excavating sites.Because this could not be done, the volunteers (just eight of them) were asked if they would like to study highly detailed topographical scans of the Tamar Valley – the border between Cornwall and Devon – and surrounding areas.The scans cover 4,000 sq km (1,540 sq miles) and Smart has broken them up into 1,000 grids. He hands out a number of grids to the volunteers, who then study them at their leisure and try to pick out human-made features hidden in the landscapes, such as enclosed settlements. They cross-refer them to records of known archaeology and historic maps to find sites previously missed.Smart said: “I knew there would be enthusiasm within our volunteer group to continue working during lockdown, but I don’t think they realised how many new discoveries they would make.”They have found about 20 prehistoric burial mounds, as well as the remains of hundreds of medieval farms, field systems and quarries.But perhaps the most interesting are the settlements and roads believed to come from just before and during Romano-British times.One of the most exciting discoveries is the remains of a Roman road the researchers believe would have once linked the forts of Calstock, near Tavistock, and Restormel, near Bodmin.The vestiges of the road appear as faint white marks on the aerial image. Close by is a line of black dots, which would have been quarry pits.Smart said: “We’ve always known there would be Roman roads connecting major military installations. But we haven’t known exactly where they are.”He added: “It’s hard for us not to be able to carry out the work we had planned this summer – including an excavation at Calstock – but hopefully this is only a temporary blip and we will be back out in the countryside with volunteers as soon as it is safe to do so.”The images being used are produced by a technique known as Lidar – a topographical scan using laser light collected by a device connected to a fixed-wing plane.Among the volunteers taking part in the project is Fran Sperring, 64, a retired nurse from Newquay.“It has been totally engrossing,” she said. “We simply try to spot anything that looks manmade and has not been accounted for before. If we see something interesting we flag it up to Chris.“So far I’ve spotted what is apparently a stretch of Roman road and an enclosure complex that could be iron age or Romano-British.”Sperring has chosen to focus on the west of the area being studied because she lives close by. “It’s fascinating to see how busy Bodmin Moor was. It’s a real eye-opener. It seems to me it was much busier back then than it is now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a24c78ad63847c390aa6a2c9bf6812e2ef616ed/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cdda9c844498ad07eeb89153a212c2d9 1400w","title":"equalities watchdog drops plan for tory islamophobia inquiry","story":"Conservative party commits to own investigation but UK’s largest Muslim body brands it a ‘facade’ The equalities watchdog has dropped plans to launch an inquiry into Tory Islamophobia after the party set out new details of its own investigation, which the largest Muslim body in Britain has branded “a facade”.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) have said it does not think it is proportionate to carry out its own inquiry after the Conservatives committed to an independent investigation looking into complaints of discrimination over “religion or belief and significantly Islam”.However, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which submitted a dossier of 300 cases to the watchdog cataloguing alleged Islamophobia, said the terms of reference set out by the Tories was inadequate.Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB, said: “We have previously described the Conservative party’s attitude to Islamophobia as one of denial, dismissal and deceit. The publication of the terms of reference for its inquiry reflects that regrettable attitude. They are a facade to hide the hundreds of incidences of Islamophobic bigotry we have identified in its ranks.”An EHRC spokesperson said it had carefully considered the complaints and, given the party’s decision to launch an investigation, it would not take further action but would monitor the review and ask the Tories to provide updates.Khan said the MCB is concerned about the inquiry’s limited focus, only looking at the way complaints are handled, rather than the issue of racism within the party. It also claims the Tory’s inquiry has been broadened to include all discrimination and is not focusing enough on anti-Islamic sentiment.It is being led by former commissioner of the EHRC, Prof Swaran Singh. The terms of reference were formally supported by the watchdog on Monday.Among the examples submitted to the party by the MCB was the London 2016 mayoral campaign by Tory peer Zac Goldsmith. He was accused of falsely linking Labour’s Sadiq Khan, who is a Muslim, to extremism. Goldsmith has said he does not have a “racist bone in his body” and regretted the portrayal of his campaign.Sally-Ann Hart, the MP for Hastings and Rye, was placed under investigation by the party for sharing a post claiming the Women’s March had been hijacked by the Muslim Brotherhood for a “Muslim agenda”. She had not commented on this incident directly.Anthony Browne, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, was also listed for having questioned the loyalty of Muslims to Britain when responding to Muslim leaders’ concerns about the Iraq war. He had said they were “a large minority with such ided loyalties”. He later apologised. Khan said: “While it is clear that Islamophobia is not treated equally to other forms of racism in the public domain including by many public bodies, we still hold out hope that many will see through this facade, and we can – sooner rather than later – have a true independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the party.”He said the Conservative party’s decision not to adopt the group’s definition of Islamophobia like other political parties was indicative of a government “dragging its feet” on the issue and it needed to tackle the issue within its own ranks.The Labour party is being investigated by the EHRC for its handling of antisemitic complaints and it is due to report its findings later this year.Amanda Milling MP, co-chairman of the Conservative party, said having the terms of reference agreed was a positive step forward.She said: “The Conservative party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. It is why we are committed to this investigation, to ensure that any abuse that is not fit for public life is stamped out. The Conservative party is committed to ensuring everyone’s rights are respected and everyone is treated with fairness and dignity.”A spokesperson for the EHRC said: “We will be monitoring the review and requiring the party to provide regular updates on progress. If we are not satisfied with progress or how the investigation is conducted we will review our decision and do not rule out the use of our legal powers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5803f075cc9bfd384a02bd3fc066d57d8b77fa24/74_0_2534_1520/master/2534.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=9ecc26d5deecbef66ebc13bbc9e4e17d","title":"sign your own balls tennis and golf tentative steps out of coronavirus lockdown","story":"Initial your own balls before stepping on to court. Use hand sanitiser but avoid handshakes before the action begins. And don’t, on any account, touch your opponent’s balls with your hands – but rather use your racket or foot to flick the ball back to the other side of the net.These are just some of the guidelines that tennis players will be expected to follow when courts are reopened in England on Wednesday. The LTA, British tennis’s governing body, said it had contacted nearly 10,000 clubs, coaches and venues with its updated advice on how to resume safely – with many confirming they intend to open where feasible to capitalise on the demand for exercise and the forecast settled weather.“We are pleased that the adjustment of lockdown restrictions mean that people can get back on court and enjoy playing tennis again,” the LTA chief executive, Scott Lloyd, told the . “Even if you’ve never played or just haven’t played in a while, now is a great time to find a court and get some exercise by playing tennis.”Sebastien Blanchon, meanwhile, the head coach at Dulwich Lawn Tennis Club, said there was “mayhem” among members when the government confirmed on Monday that the lockdown rules would be relaxed to allow singles matches between people from different households. “Hundreds of emails have been sent and received – it’s just like everybody is throwing themselves at tennis,” he told the .Elsewhere Charles Morris, the head coach at Telford Park Lawn Tennis Club, insisted he had no concerns about returning to work. “I think it’s a pretty good sport for social distancing as long as you don’t touch your opponent’s balls,” he added. “When we play singles, we will both mark our balls and only pick up our own. “I would be more worried if I had to work in a school. Groups of kids are just too difficult. But on an inidual basis I think it’s quite easy to control. I think I’m quite optimistic about that.”Tennis is not the only sport taking the first tentative steps to open up on Wednesday. England Golf says it is very confident that the vast majority of their 1,800 courses will be open on Wednesday despite the short time frame to prepare – with many reporting massive demand for a tee time. One website, intelligentgolf, which helps club members schedule tee off times, showed an error message for much of Tuesday saying: “We are experiencing extremely high load, please try again shortly.”Gary Pearce, the managing secretary of Ganton Golf Club in North Yorkshire, also reported a rush of people wanting to play. “On Monday evening, I opened up tee time bookings for a week from Wednesday and it became pretty busy straight away,” he said. “I think we will see an initial surge because a lot of people are very keen to get back out there. We need more tee times than usual simply because of the restriction to two balls whereas people could typically play in fours.”Jeremy Tomlinson, the England Golf chief executive, admitted that most clubs would have liked more time to prepare but everyone in golf was “working their backsides off” to make sure they were ready in some form to accommodate groups of two going out from early on Wednesday morning.“We are so excited that we can start again,” he added. “To the best of my knowledge, the majority of those 1,800 golf courses will be open on Wednesday. I don’t know what the exact percentage will be but I think it will be very high. Golf clubs, no matter what their size, will want to get back on the journey to financial stability.“There is golfer pressure, and not just from the 640,000 golf club members, but there’s another two million who play golf avidly who want to get back to playing. So there’s a great incentive for golf clubs to reopen.”Tomlinson admitted that many courses will reap no financial benefit from the initial reopening process, with clubhouses and pro shops remaining closed until the latter stages of the lockdown exit plan.“Without exception, the golf courses in England have been exemplary throughout this time, but the majority of them are creaking under the financial strain,” he added. “They have furloughed staff, they’ve carried out essential maintenance, the general managers and clubs pros have worked together and worked with us in trying to make sure golf courses could reopen at any point.”Of course, there will be no socialising at the 19th hole for a while yet, while the same tough social distancing guidance also means that post-tennis drinks are still a long way off too. As the advice on the LTA’s website reminds players: “Do not congregate after playing. No extra-curricular or social activity should take place.” Even so, after seven weeks of being unable to hit a ball in anger, stepping on to court or the first tee will feel like blessed relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1093d9596862304b748057e8f3dfa4bb14b7f26/0_175_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668a19a37817c30ce3ffd66baf0b6f84","title":"velvet wonderlands the plush pleasure palaces of frank matchless matcham","story":"He was our ‘greatest theatrical architect’, the creator of 150 magnificent buildings that delighted crowds from Glasgow to Blackpool to London. On the centenary of his death, we celebrate a stage visionaryA pub quiz question. What do the following have in common: Blackpool Tower Ballroom, the Grand Opera House Belfast, Hackney Empire and the London Palladium? All were the creation of Frank Matcham, the centenary of whose death falls this Sunday. Alan Bennett, a devout admirer, called him “undoubtedly this country’s greatest theatrical architect”. At a time when we are resigned to many more months of virtual playgoing, it is a joy to celebrate the sensuous memories of sitting in one of Matcham’s matchless theatres.The bare facts of his career are fascinating. He was born in Devon in 1854, was apprenticed at 14 to a Torquay architect, came to London in 1875 and joined the practice of Jethro T Robinson, who was consulting architect to the Lord Chamberlain and whose daughter he went on to marry. After Robinson’s death in 1878, Matcham took over the building of the Elephant and Castle theatre in London. But that was just the start. His explosive heyday lasted from 1891 to 1913, when he designed not just theatres and music halls but such local landmarks as the County Arcade in Leeds, Harrogate’s Royal Hall and the Blackpool Tower Circus. It is estimated that he built or rebuilt more than 150 theatres, of which 26 still thankfully survive.What makes a Matcham theatre so special? Several things. One is that no two Matcham buildings are alike. The King’s Theatre in Glasgow, with its arcade of conches, is Scots baroque. The Grand Opera House Belfast, all onion domes and elephant heads, is extravagantly oriental. And the London Coliseum – widely considered to be his masterpiece – suggests, through its terracotta facade and Venetian windows, a hymn to the Italian Renaissance. But the Coliseum offers another clue to Matcham’s genius: his ability to combine intimacy and opulence. One of his core beliefs was that every seat should provide a good view having sat in the rear stalls and circle at the Colly, I can vouch for that.The penny dropped about his gifts when I read an essay in an excellent volume called Frank Matcham and Co, edited by David Wilmore. Andrew Saint, in a piece entitled Frank Matcham in Perspective, makes the point that Matcham, working in a hectically commercial environment, had little time for rule-based classicism or the refinement of William Morris’s arts and crafts movement. Instead, Saint draws a parallel between Matcham and Dickens, which strikes me as brilliantly perceptive.John Earl, writing in The Matcham Directory, talks of “the sheer variety of the man’s joyful inventions”. You could apply the same words to Dickens – and, as with the writer, Matcham’s work was often patronised by academic purists. Edwin Sachs, in a triple volume devoted to modern opera houses and theatres, wrote that to illustrate Matcham’s work in such a tome “would be as anomalous as to include the jerry builder’s cottages in a volume on domestic architecture”. That sneer reminds me of FR Leavis excluding Dickens from The Great Tradition on the grounds that, with the exception of Hard Times, his novels lack “a sustained seriousness”.But the whirligig of time brings its revenges. Matcham’s work was viewed with hostility by the architectural establishment during his own life and for 50 years after his death. Since 1970, however, it has been enthusiastically celebrated. It all started when the threatened demolition of the Lyric Hammersmith in London reminded us that it boasted a magnificent Matcham auditorium.Then came the discovery of 10,000 previously unseen drawings from the Matcham office that belied the idea of him as some rough-and-ready improviser. Above all, there has been a growing reaction over the past half century against the monochrome monotony of many a civic playhouse. At a time when even the illustrious Denys Lasdun, who designed the National Theatre, was said “to have no language for frivolity”, we crave a bit of Matchamesque panache.Obviously, you can’t simply reproduce his style today: it was a product of Victorian and Edwardian expansiveness. (It’s striking how many of his suburban music halls were “Empires”.) But we yearn for Matcham’s freewheeling inventiveness and – as the theatre guru Iain Mackintosh pointed out – we now have it in the work of Steve Tompkins. He and his partners have worked on a huge variety of theatres including the Liverpool Everyman, the Bristol Old Vic, the restored grand hall at Battersea Arts Centre in London and the Bridge on the capital’s South Bank. They all have flair, wit and a rapport between stage and audience that is the essence of a first-rate theatre.When Tompkins was named most influential person in British theatre in the Stage’s annual list in 2019, the paper’s editor, Alistair Smith, hailed Tompkins as a modern Matcham. Before 1970, the comparison would have been meaningless. Today it is the highest compliment a theatre architect can receive. When we eventually get the chance to sit once again in a Matcham theatre, we should take a moment to look around and rejoice in the work of this native theatrical genius."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/652304a773462adf2b7f28222c1cd8335cad5886/548_225_2452_1472/master/2452.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2456a4ca62ee88ee242e775e8e34a19d","title":"twitter coronavirus covid19 work from home","story":"The company said those who want to return to the office won’t likely do so until at least September and reopening will be ‘careful’Twitter will allow its employees to work from home “forever”, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the , saying the company was “one of the first companies to go to a work-from-home model” due to Covid-19, but does not anticipate being one of the first to return to its offices.“We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere,” the company said in a blogpost.“The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.”Twitter has “strongly encouraged” working from home since 2 March and mandated employees to work from home starting 11 March. Employees who prefer to work remotely can now do so indefinitely, Twitter said in its statement. Those who want to return to the office will probably need to wait until at least September.“When we do decide to open offices, it also won’t be a snap back to the way it was before,” the company said. “It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual.”Twitter has suspended almost all employee business travel and all of its in-person events until 2021. It is also giving employees increased allowances to buy home office supplies including desks and desk chairs.The change comes as companies across the tech industry are weighing how to manage their offices in the coming months. Google and Facebook extended their work-from-home policies into 2021. Amazon extended its work-from-home policy until at least early October.Twitter’s headquarters is based in San Francisco where, in April, Mayor London Breed extended the city’s shelter-in-place orders through the end of May. Meanwhile, Governor Gavin Newsom has taken steps toward slowly reopening the state, allowing some retailers to start curbside pickup services. Los Angeles, where half of the state’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred, announced on Tuesday it would probably extend its shelter-in-place order another three months.There have been nearly 70,000 cases of coronavirus in California since 1 March, and 2,847 deaths. Of those nearly 70,000 cases, 1,974 occurred in San Francisco, where Twitter is based."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e32f44ea16b555d5aaa70b13d952eb2fad9cb6cc/724_699_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=977850c0dd5228157dacd68b5d779630","title":"samsung galaxy watch active 2 review best smartwatch for android","story":"Great screen, performance, battery life and health tracking – but held back by small niggles Samsung’s Galaxy Watch Active 2 may not run Android, but it is the best Android-compatible smartwatch available.The Galaxy Watch Active 2 starts at £269, costing £289 as reviewed here, and is the firm’s 10th smartwatch. Samsung has been making smartwatches since 2013 and it shows – the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the most polished this side of the Apple Watch Series 5.The Active 2 comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, both measuring 10.9mm thick. The 44mm version weighs just 30g without the strap, which is 6.5g lighter than the aluminium 44mm Apple Watch Series 5 and just one-third the weight of the Fossil Gen 5.It has a large, crisp and bright OLED screen that’s easily readable outdoors, plus an excellent selection of digital and analogue watch faces, and a large store of third-party offerings too.The thin bezel around the edge of the screen has a neat trick: it is touch sensitive and acts like a rotary controller similar to the spinning bezels on previous Samsung smartwatches.Slide your finger around the edge to scroll through lists, between screens or adjust numbers, with little vibration clicks for each increment. It’s a simple and effective control scheme that is well integrated into the whole of the system unlike digital crowns in Wear OS. Taps, swipes, a physical back button and an apps button take care of the rest.The Active 2 is water-resistant to a depth of 50 metres, and has a special water mode for preventing accidental activation and clearing the speaker of liquid when you come out. The watch comes with a high quality silicone strap, and takes standard 20mm watch bands.Samsung makes both the hardware and the software for its smartwatches and it really pays off. Performance all round is fast, snappy and lag-free. It’s considerably better than even the best Wear OS watches, and very close to the slick experience Apple offers.With the screen on all the time, I easily get more than two days battery out of the Active 2, even with a 25-minute run or a two-hour walk tracked in high-accuracy mode.The Active 2 wirelessly charges in just under two hours using a puck that magnetically attaches to the back of the watch. You can also charge the watch from the back of a Samsung smartphone with Powershare and with compatible wireless chargers.The watch connects to your phone via Bluetooth, but can also remotely connect through wifi when out of range. The connection was strong and reliable, managed by the Samsung Galaxy Wearable app, which handles pairing, settings, apps and other bits.You can connect Bluetooth headphones directly to the watch to play music and listen to alerts without a phone too. Calls can also be taken directly on the watch, which works surprisingly well.Samsung’s smartwatches run the firm’s own Tizen operating system, rather than Google’s Wear OS or Android. Since release in 2019, the Active 2 has received a series of updates that have improved various aspects of the watch. The firm has also offered long-term software updates to previous watches, which bodes well for new models coming this year.Tizen is based on a rotary interface, which makes the most of round watch screens, but can also be swiped with your finger.Notifications appear in tiles to the left of the watch face while widgets including music controls are on the right. Swipe down from the top for quick settings. Press the apps button on the side of the watch to bring up a ring of app icons, which you can tap or scroll around using the bezel.Tap a notification to expand and scroll through text, or swipe up to dismiss. You can action the notification with the same options you’d have on your phone or quick reply to messages using canned responses, a T9-like keyboard, drawing letters on screen or dictation. It all works really well.There are only a handful of third-party apps, but that does include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify which includes offline music downloads and playback.Samsung’s voice assistant, Bixby, is the least polished bit of the Active 2. You can set timers, alarms, turn features on or off, start workouts, ask for the weather and other bits, but you cannot ask general knowledge questions. It also fails to activate sometimes, fails to understand more often than competitors and a recent update to Bixby broke it entirely requiring a full reset of the watch to fix.Samsung Health is most comprehensive health-tracking services available and is built into the Active 2.It has all the usual features: constant heart rate, stress, steps, floors climbed, activity and menstrual cycle. But it also has hydration, caffeine, weight and sleep.Sleep tracking is good, matching data from a mattress-based tracker. Workout tracking is equally comprehensive, including walking, running, hiking, cycling, swimming, circuits, weights, yoga, loads of calisthenics and various gym machines.For running, you get many of the same options you get from a lower-end dedicated running watch. You can customise the information on screen, set targets for distance, time, calories, set up guides or laps and have the watch automatically pause when you do. The back button pauses or starts the run, which is better than using a touchscreen.The GPS-trace, pace and heart rate readings in high-accuracy mode in suburban London were similar to a Garmin Forerunner 245 too.The watch has the hardware to perform an ECG, but it’s currently disabled pending an update with no timescale. The firm recently won regulatory approval in South Korea for a blood pressure monitoring system, which is expected to roll out there later this year.The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 comes in either 40mm or 44mm sizes and with or without 4G connectivity.The Galaxy Watch Active 2 might not actually run Android, but that’s to its benefit. As Google’s Wear OS has stagnated, Samsung has steadily improved Tizen and provided updates for its existing watches for years.The Active 2 is light, well-made, small with a large, bright, always-on screen. There are plenty of watch faces to choose from, the battery lasts two days and apps such as Strava and offline Spotify are actually good.The Active 2 also excels at tracking health and fitness, beyond simply steps or runs, leaning on the long-standing Samsung Health platform.But a few niggles such as poor support for Samsung Pay in the UK, Bixby and some notification oddities hold it back from being a five-star product. It can be used with an iPhone, but the Apple Watch is miles better on iOS.The Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 is the best all-round smartwatch you can get for Android.Pros: slim, big and bright screen, lightweight, slick performance, long battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50 metre water resistance, standard 20mm straps, long software support, cross platform.Cons: poor contactless payment support, Bixby is poor, issues with some smart camera notifications from some manufacturers, limited functionality with an iPhone.

Absorbing, humanising and heartbreaking. What we said: “The show’s scorn for churned-out, cheap entertainment for the masses is palpable. This is rich television that demands you give it your full attention.” Read more.This Glasgow-set drama rose above the surfeit of primetime thrillers with its shocking central premise of a middle-class couple recruiting a troubled 18-year-old surrogate. With three complex leads – played by Line of Duty’s Martin Compston, Peaky Blinders’ Sophie Rundle and newcomer Mirren Mack – this was easily the BBC’s best thriller since Doctor Foster.What we said: “As the series has progressed, it has become increasingly obvious that this is not so much a thriller about surrogacy as it is a fierce commentary on aspiration, class and success – on who gets to have ambitions in life and who doesn’t.” Read more.The quarantine hit that launched a thousand memes. Tiger King introduced us to the eminently sketchy, infinitely bingeable world of Joe Exotic – zoo proprietor, country singer and possible murderer – and his arch nemesis, Carole Baskin, a self-styled conservationist with some very interesting views on animal welfare. What we said: “In Tiger King, reality is stranger than fiction and the characters larger than life – their morality and culpability in Joe Exotic’s fall is up to viewer discretion.” Read more.Created by and starring Lennie James, and with Stephen Graham, Lesley Manville and Suranne Jones among its cast, the second series of Sky’s thriller ratcheted the intrigue up to 11 as it threw viewers back into the underbelly of south-east London, where traffickers, gangsters and peril bubble just below the surface.What we said: “It has far more emotional depth than most of its rivals … and stands firm as a gripping thriller. It starts with the kind of bang that insists you pay attention to find out how we got here: in this case, to Nelly, sitting in a car, examining his bloody fists.” Read more.This is arguably the best mockumentary since The Office, and the misadventures of bumpkin cousins Kerry and Kurtan (real-life siblings Daisy-May and Charlie Cooper) were both absurd and loving. As well as nailing the frequent banality of country living, the duo captured the nation’s hearts to the end.What we said: “All of human life is here, in this bleak, hugely funny, intimate, seemingly slight yet ridiculously potent series of six perfectly formed half-hours.” Read moreSeventy-five years on from the liberation of Auschwitz, this devastating one-off programme told the stories of Holocaust survivors at the Bergen-Belsen camp where more than 50,000 people died, via archive footage and staggering personal testimony. What we said: “Each remarkable person interviewed in this documentary finds the strength to describe the nightmarish barbarism they endured, and it is clearly difficult beyond belief for them to relive it. But they are doing so in order for it not to be forgotten.” Read more.It’s no easy feat to reboot a story told a thousand times over, let alone twice. But the writers of Sherlock – Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss – did just that when they took on Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and to fabulous effect. Gender flips, time shifts and a brilliantly sexy yet vicious central performance by Claes Bang made this a New Year’s delight.What we said: “It’s a bloodstained love letter to a classic, beautifully and delicately scented with the faintest hint of ham that gothic yarns need a homage to all the great counts who have gone before, but still entirely its own thing.” Read more.Who’d have thought 2020 would be the year everyone got into cheerleading? The peculiar mix of gymnastics, dance and heartbreaking back stories captivated, as coach Monica Aldama put her young charges through their paces – with scant regard for their physical wellbeing. The sight of teenage girls flipping and falling on their faces is sometimes painful to watch, but it’s impossible to look away.What we said: “Look what the human body is capable of” you will start to think, as 40 students made entirely of muscle and sinew bend, flip, form pyramids, toss and catch each other midair – and generally disapply all known laws of physics. They are as gods, and if you cannot hope to emulate, you will surely wish to serve.” Read more.A sitcom about addiction, mental health and toxic relationships might not seem like a barrel of laughs, but at the heart of this six part series is the tender romance between writerstar Mae Martin and Charlotte Ritchie’s George. It’s beautifully drawn, both painful and touching, but above all it’s funny. And Lisa Kudrow as Mae’s overbearing mother is a joy. What we said: “Feel Good should make you feel good. It’s not only an immaculately written and paced piece of work and a properly funny comedy, it has also created a delicately and intricately constructed, deeply humane world.” Read more.Keeping any show fresh after five series is tough, even more so when each episode features a new set of characters, in a different world, usually with a devilish sting in the tail. But Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith are up to the challenge – and this year’s outings were some of the best, from the classically mind-bending dissection of the magician’s craft that was Misdirection to the surprisingly touching kitchen sink drama of Love’s Great Adventure – Inside No 9 did not disappoint. And that’s without even mentioning the return of some old favourites from Psychoville, their previous hit series. We’ll never listen to Soulja Boy the same again.What we said: “The show’s ability to surprise goes well beyond hairpin narrative turns. Inside No 9 practises a kind of genre fusion that is still rare in TV.” Read more.Michael Sheen’s uncanny rendition of Chris Tarrant might have captured the headlines, but it was Matthew Macfadyen who stole the show – based on the play by James Graham – with his quietly brilliant performance as Major Charles Ingram. This ITV mini-series, which recreated the Who Wants to be a Millionaire? scandal of 2001, landed at the perfect time for a nation coming to terms with a pandemic, and left many of us questioning what we thought we knew and the justice of that conviction from all those years ago.What we said: “Once the nuts and bolts are dealt with and the focus shifts to the Ingrams and life among normal humans outside the TV studios, the drama becomes as addictive as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? proved.” Read more.Just when you thought Flirty Dancing was as weird as reality TV dating could get, Netflix popped up in the wings to say “hold my glass”. The bizarre sight of singletons talking to a wall before professing their undying love to each other (sight unseen) was hard to look away from, and matched by what happened next. It’s difficult to forget watching Jessica feed wine to her dog, or the look on Giannina’s face at the altar.What we said: “You will be bleary-eyed and shattered from all the shouting you have done, the emotional investment you have made, the WhatsApp messages you have typed to a specially formed group and the heartfelt contributions you have made to various internet forums on the subject.” Read more.The first series of this travelogue turned reality contest was a delight, and the second couldn’t have come at a better time. With the chance to travel to South America never having seemed further away, the vicarious thrill of watching the duos explore everywhere from Chapultepec castle in Mexico City to the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia in Argentina, is exhilarating. But what really made it such a joy was the human interactions, from the bickering of siblings Dom and Lizzie as they rediscover their friendship to the wonderfully tender motherson relationship of Jo and Sam. Roll on series three.What we said: “Race Across the World is an astounding piece of TV because it captures all the vibrant highs and exhausted lows of travel in all of their raw glory: the flooded hotels, the 18-hour coach trips, the moments of giving up, the bafflingly undesirable toilets, communicating in a nonsensical language halfway between English and Spanish but also the late-night beers, the dancing with strangers, the helpful locals hand-drawing a map on the back of a notepad, the ecstatic feeling of a comfortable bed.” Read more.This anthology series was a sensitive take on immigration in modern America, all based on essays penned for Epic magazine. It was also a hopeful glimpse at what Apple could achieve with its new streaming platform. With stories ranging from an Indian boy having to manage his parents’ motel after they are deported to a Nigerian cowboy tackling racism in the 1980s US, Little America was a poignant reminder of the continuing need for ersity and inclusion in the country and on our screens. What we said: “A set of small, intimate endeavours that feature no star names and that privilege storytelling above all else.” Read more.No one would have guessed that a cartoon about a washed-up talking horse would become one of the most incisively satirical and emotionally brutal pieces of TV to have been produced in the last decade. Yet Bojack Horseman’s creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg delivered on the gut punches, cathartic laughs, and perhaps even a glimmer of hope for its menagerie of characters in tinseltown for its sixth and final season. What we said: “Like The Simpsons or Daria, two of creator Bob-Waksberg’s touchstones, BoJack Horseman can be touching and profound without relinquishing the funny.” Read more.Self-indulgent millennial romp or nuanced exposition of young love and its attendant traumas? Whatever your take on Sally Rooney’s bestselling novel, its small-screen adaptation was a beautiful thing to behold with the on-and-off-again relationship of Marianne and Connell played with nuance and depth by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Paul Mescal. Producing record-breaking streaming figures for the BBC, the show struck a tender note with viewers during lockdown. What we said: “It leaves you either wanting more, or relieved that you are not being asked to relive the exquisite agony of first love for any longer.” Read the full review.Arch-cynic Frankie Boyle set out on a four-part tour of his home country, trialling new standup routines in clubs from Aberdeen to Glasgow and engaging in local delights along the way. Among the hilarity was Boyle in a treehouse caravan with a hermit, a visit to a commune and a historical re-enactment, all underpinned by a poignant examination of his Scottish identity.What we said: “If, as he says, there comes a time in every comedian’s career when he turns to travelogues, we can be glad he has arrived at his.” Read more.Exquisitely detailed and shot mostly in Berlin, this four-part drama based on the memoirs of Deborah Feldman is a tale of escape from rigid conservatism. It has a breakout performance by 24-year-old Shira Haas as Esty, a 19-year-old Hasidic Jew running from her claustrophobic Brooklyn community, and is an engrossing coming-of-age tale, thriller and love letter to independence.What we said: “Anyone who feels a need to struggle for iniduality against their community, they’ll find some of themselves in the show.” Read more.Bob Odenkirk’s dodgy lawyer Saul Goodman was a passing highlight of Breaking Bad, but in this prequel he had enough riveting backstory to merit five seasons of drama. This penultimate series saw the seeds of his transition to the wheeler-dealer Saul putting pressure on his relationship with Kim and luring him deeper into the cartel’s operations in the process.What we said: “We won’t like where Jimmy and Kim are going, but we can guarantee it’ll be fun to watch.” Read more.Even if you knew nothing about 90s US basketball, no matter – this tale of Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman and the Chicago Bulls’ 1997-98 season still made for riveting viewing. Packed with boxy suits, slow-mo slam dunks and the high-stakes politics of the NBA, the series was a glimpse into the psyche of one of the greatest sportsmen of all time and the context that made and almost broke him.What we said: “Once you understand the singularity of Jordan’s focus, everything else about him makes sense.” Read more."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8d496288700e52a96c8cc386033b69f4e2b1c35/0_225_4935_2961/master/4935.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2157edcf2ca9d4d052b8f9ceb570510","title":"coronavirus loud neighbors community lockdown","story":"Locked-down Americans are learning more than they ever wanted to know about their neighbors. But the disease is building socially distant bonds, tooOne day a month into quarantine, Christie was leading a Zoom board meeting of the local political club where she’s president when the floor in the unit directly above started creaking. It was just as she feared: her upstairs neighbor had decided to engage in loud intimate activities.“I just sat there waiting to see if anyone said anything,” she said from her San Diego apartment. “They couldn’t hear it. But it was so distracting and made me so anxious.”Now she’s looking fearfully ahead to the next Zoom meeting she’s slated to lead with the full club, which will feature 30 to 60 people, including elected officials. “The thought of that happening again during it scares me a lot,” she said. “I need to ask how thick the walls are next time I move.”Americans are spending more time than ever at home and that means redefining relationships with neighbors – for better and, sometimes, for worse.In cities, parties in apartment buildings that were once merely a nuisance may seem suddenly nefarious, imbued with the potential to unleash contagion. And disturbances like a baby crying or a particularly thunderous living-room dance-off can quickly drive the best-intentioned neighbors to despair.One 47-year-old mom of two in Minneapolis said a neighbor’s birthday party recently prompted her to call the police. “Seeing them all gathering, not caring about social distancing, I actually started to cry,” she said. “Each one person that doesn’t care causes a ripple effect. It’s going to be a tsunami sooner or later.”Even slovenly dress has become a point of contention in certain communities.A Maryland police department recently entreated local residents to put on pants before retrieving mail. And on NextDoor, the social media network that connects neighbors and is known as a place for petty complaints, one user asked neighbors not to leave the house in pajamas.“You don’t have to dress to the nines but please consider clean, neat casual clothes … women maybe do a bit of makeup,” a Richmond, Virginia, resident named Jerry recently wrote in a post. “Just because we are experiencing a crisis we don’t have to be slobs.”One Bay Area resident posted on Nextdoor that, after witnessing a neighbor purchasing large bags of Clorox wipes, they rooted through the trash to ensure the neighbor was throwing them away rather than flushing them down the toilet. (Evidently they were concerned for the building’s plumbing.)And coronavirus has also brought neighborly connections to new heights. Italy’s balcony singalongs have been repeated around the globe and across the country, from Boston to Indianapolis to Wichita, Kansas and San Jose, California. Residents of Marin county, California, have organized a nightly howling.Harriet Riley, a writing instructor in New Orleans, was at first distraught about the prospect of having to cancel her annual crawfish boil, a beloved Louisiana tradition. That is, until she realized there was still a way to connect.“We set up a long table at the end of our driveway with the four ice chests of crawfish,” she said, and each family had just one designated person approach. “Everyone took their crawfish to their front porches and we laughed and yelled around to each other. We also saw some neighbors that we don’t see as often. The crawfish really brought everyone out.”Such interactions mark a surprising shift. A pre-Covid report found that only about a fifth of Americans regularly spent time with their neighbors, while a third said they had never interacted with those living next door to them. It’s a steep drop from several decades ago, when a third of Americans spent time with their neighbors twice a week or more.Now even the barter economy is enjoying a boost. Sandra Choute, a special education department chair within the Maryland public school system, found herself making a deal with a neighbor in her complex who works as a nursing assistant and lacked supplies to mend a mask.“She needed needles and thread,” Choute said. “I made her a small sewing kit and she gave me gloves and masks.”Choute’s relationships with neighbors have gotten deeper, she added. Casual chit-chat from her balcony can easily turn emotional, as it did recently when a neighbor in the grass below explained how an aunt in New York was battling both cancer and Covid at once. “She’s in tears and I’m just trying to talk to her, trying to lift her spirits,” Choute recalled.It can be easy, while complaining about or praising one’s neighbors, to forget that you are also a neighbor yourself, as Hillary, a communications specialist from Cincinnati, discovered recently.“My downstairs neighbor is definitely still having hookups,” she said a few weeks ago. “Should I call the police, or … ?”But when the  circled back a week later, Hillary was in higher spirits. She and a different neighbor from down the hall had started dating.“The tables have turned,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfef76e42da6298d528fb31c11e6361facff69f7/0_1_4981_2989/master/4981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b7f41c0deffe24243d2ee99dc2404ad","title":"are you planning to return to your workplace on wednesday","story":"If you’re preparing to go back to work – away from home – we’d like to hear from you.

From Wednesday, people can socialise in open spaces or play one-on-one sport such as tennis, as long as participants stay two metres apart. Sunbathing and outdoor picnics are allowed in local parks, but just with members of a household.Children returning to schools in England as early as next month will be taught in “protective bubbles” of no more than 15.Lockdown has been extended to 28 May by the Scottish government, which has been promoting a fresh message: “Please continue to #StayAtHome. By staying at home, you are saving lives.”In a relaxation, the once-a-day outdoor exercise rule has been lifted but Scots have been warned to avoid meeting up in groups in parks and avoid sunbathing or picnics.Differing from the guidance in England, the Scottish government says that businesses whose employees cannot work from home should only open if their role is essential for the wellbeing of society or as part of efforts to tackle Covid-19.Sturgeon does not envisage schools being able to open as early as 1 June.The Welsh government has sought to continue the slogan ditched by Downing Street by promoting its own message urging the public to “please continue to stay at home”.Garden centres are being allowed to reopen while people are able to exercise more than once a day although the Welsh government has avoided giving a green light to sunbathing and having picnics in parks.While Wales has not followed Downing Street on the economy, first steps have been taken in the form of a law compelling employers to ensure workers keep 2 metres apart.There are no plans to fully reopen schools in Wales on 1 June. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, also says there is not enough evidence to encourage people to wear face coverings in public.Stay Home remains an official slogan but a five-stage plan for easing lockdown has been published by the power-sharing executive at Stormont – albeit without a timetable of the sort in place in England.The first stage of the blueprint, Coronavirus – Executive Approach to Decision-Making, allows for groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing.Those unable to work from home will be encouraged to return to work on a phased basis if the reproductive rate at which the virus spreads continues to stay below one.The document permits what it describes as “drive-through church services” along with the opening of places of worship for private prayer. Stormont’s education minister has said he doesn’t envisage a a phased return of schools until September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/443a50ed6bd72f311480e43f6073571881b150d4/0_111_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1db2ba23188b8744cdf1ab372daee6df","title":"uk commuters share your photos and experiences of travelling to work lockdown","story":"What it is like to travel to work at the moment?

The wave of infections also spread from the hospitals to the old people’s homes, which could also have been avoided. The government is now trying to pretend to the public that it has the situation under control.”Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung acknowledged the UK’s special context: “The prime minister may be credited with having to fight a harder struggle than some other heads of government. Britain (and London in particular) is particularly vulnerable. As a former colonial power and Europe’s air hub, it is in close contact with the world. Many Britons live in metropolitan areas where the virus spreads faster. With the state’s National Health Service, the nation has also given itself a health system that is cumbersome, bureaucratic and has been underfunded for some time.”It predicted: “Once the nation has returned to normal, more citizens than before may question faith in British exceptionalism. That will not immediately drive them back into the arms of the European Union. But it could at least increase pressure on the Johnson government to prolong trade talks with the EU and not to fail with a gesture of arrogance.”The Spanish newspaper El País reported the UK government’s strategy had generated confusion and anger among citizens, businessmen and the self-employed.It claimed Johnson had always known how to pitch his speech to the character of the British and tell them what they wanted to hear. “Or at least make them smile. Until now.”In an editorial, Le Monde, the leading French daily, described Britain’s new slogan as cringeworthy, given the UK had recorded the worst mortality figures in Europe.Its news report suggested the UK itself was “fading” and added: “Despite Europe’s worst mortality, probably too late entry into confinement and a blatant lack of preparation, the British have so far supported Johnson.”The Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant also challenged the UK performance: “According to many, testing, testing, testing is the motto. That has hardly happened in the UK for weeks, losing sight of the spread of the virus. This gap shows that the British were insufficiently prepared for the pandemic, despite the presence of expertise in this area. The country has been catching up in recent weeks. Much of the harm has already been done.”The Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet criticised Johnson’s ambiguity while the New York Times said many had been left baffled, adding: “His proposals had run into a barrage of opposition, as critics pointed to gaps and contradictions in a plan that left many pondering basic questions such as when to return to work and how to get there.”The Wall Street Journal, owned by Rupert Murdoch, was more sympathetic, saying the UK faced the same trade-offs as countries worldwide, but warned: “It’s quickly becoming a bigger political challenge for Prime Minister Boris Johnson than Brexit.”Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and a great student of the soft power league table, recently wrote: “This will be a defining period for national identities, as many of us are more attuned to what is happening globally and have more time to absorb it.“The reputation of nations has been put under the microscope. Were they efficient in responding? How did their populations react? Were they led by reason or emotion? What did they prioritise in the response? All of that will resonate for years in the league tables of soft power. There will be winners and losers”.It is hard as it stands to see the UK bidding for the title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4361503416f1399edc222b7ee8deaf70ad15b6e7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0d01803f58c0e4f6fbd133aefae003c2","title":"wednesday briefing call for vulnerable to sit out work return","story":"Unicef warns of 6,000 excess child deaths a day … at least five surfers die in Netherlands storm disaster … and cut your ‘teenage’ dog some slackHello and good morning from me, Warren Murray. Hopefully you are settled into a comfortable position – or a comfortable stride. Here is the news to start your Wednesday.Eight million people with underlying health conditions should be exempted from plans to get Britain back to work and normal life, according to scientists who warn that easing lockdown too quickly could propel the Covid-19 death toll to 73,000 this year. Union leaders have voiced concerns over Boris Johnson’s exhortations to people to return to work from today if their jobs can’t be done from home. Whether to “stay alert” or “stay home” is a different story from today depending on where you live in the UK, with devolved administrations erging from the central government’s plans for lifting the lockdown.As many as 6,000 children around the world could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months due to the impact of coronavirus on routine health services, such as family planning, childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination, Unicef has warned. This is in addition to the 2.5 million children who die globally every six months before their fifth birthday, and threatens to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable child deaths.Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike sharply on their deadliest days yet. The US remains by far the worst-affected country and now has almost one-third of the world’s 4.26m cases, and a national death tally of 82,339. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government’s top public health expert, has warned in Senate testimony via videoconference that the country’s coronavirus death toll is under-counted and “the consequences could be really serious” if America relaxes safeguards too abruptly.“There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to economic recovery.” Fauci said America might be headed in the right direction but this did not mean the pandemic was under control. And as Trump has claimed more than once, is the virus going to disappear? “That is just not going to happen,” said Fauci, who has headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.Jump on to our live blog for more Covid-19 news as it breaks, and here are the big developments at a glance.There’s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down … and here’s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak – from breaking news to factchecks and advice.Pension changes wreck health – Women in lower-grade occupations forced to work up to six years longer because of changes to the state pension age are a third more likely to suffer debilitating and potentially permanent depression, as well as higher rates of health problems, according to a paper by academics at King’s College London. “We know that worsening mental health will lead to higher healthcare costs, higher use of disability benefits and greater use of health services. Worsening mental health also leads to lower economic productivity and reduced ability to participate in life,” said Dr Ludovico Carrino, co-author of the research paper.

Scottish Power will revamp Hagshaw Hill, Scotland’s oldest commercial wind farm, as part of a £150m scheme to develop a clean energy cluster capable of supplying 100,000 homes.

They looked at German shepherds, golden retrievers, labrador retrievers or crosses of the breeds, which start puberty at about six to nine months old. Dr Lucy Asher, co-author of the research at Newcastle University, said adolescent dogs may “play up” to test the strength of the bond with their owner. Asher said she hoped the findings would help address the spike in owners taking their dogs to shelters at that age: “The hormones are raging and there are things going on in the brain,” she said.Do we need more than one vaccine?

Violent confrontation and a weekend of flash mobs followed. It recalled 2019 when protests against an extradition bill sparked months of massive demonstrations that evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement that promises to kick on this year.Covid-19 may have intervened but analysts say the stakes are rising again, with September elections looming at which pro-democracy candidates could win a majority. In recent weeks the Beijing government’s senior regional representatives have made extraordinary interventions: claiming Hong Kong’s constitutional bar on Chinese interference does not apply to them labelling protesters a virus that must be eradicated and demanding enactment of security laws that would target Hong Kong’s independence movement.

The masks would be available to buy online and in “strategic retail locations” shortly afterwards, he said.“We aim to be able to offer reliable, medical-grade masks for the lowest possible cost,” he said.Face masks were “front and centre” of the strategy for the return to work and social activity in cities internationally, Mr Sands said, and would be a “hugely important part” of the restart programme for Ireland.Stories of “price gouging” in relation to personal protection products such as masks had been prevalent since the start of the pandemic, he said, but with a strong Irish supply chain, rather than relying on importation, costs could be kept down.“We all know of masks that have been imported from China and are being sold for €20 for a pack of two or four masks. We will be selling the masks at as close as possible to cost that means they will costs cents each not euro.”Mr Sands, a former Silicon Valley technology executive, describes the company as a “social enterprise” designed to “help Ireland restart as safely as possible”.Production of the masks will begin in Mullingar, Co Westmeath, with facilities expected to open subsequently in a number of different locations. “I’d love to have the machine in my home town of Drogheda, ” Mr Sands said.The masks would be made in “clean room facilities, to the very highest standards of compliance”, he said, and while speed was of the essence, the quality of the masks would be paramount.“First you crawl, then you walk, then you run.

The fine for breaking the speed limit by up to 10kmh (6mph) outside built-up areas has doubled from €10 (£9) to €20 (£18), but is still far less than the €135 (£119) you could be forced to pay if you\u0027re caught speeding in France.Germany\u0027s maximum penalty for speeding by more than 70kmh (60mph) in town remains a  €680 (£600) fine plus two penalty points and a three-month driving ban.But it is a move to introduce driving bans at lower speeds that has enraged German motorists.“The new penalties are a sword of Damocles over motorists’ heads,” said Michael Haberland, the man behind the online petition.The Munich local politician told Bild newspaper the new rules would result in 2m driving bans a year and could cost 200,000 Germans their jobs.“It will hit professional drivers and commuters the worst,” he said.The petition, which calls for the new rules on driving bans to be overturned, attracted 50,000 signatures in its three days online and has now gathered more than 124,000.Previously, driving bans were rarely enforced in Germany for those caught speeding by less than 40kmh (24mph), or 30khm (19mph) in built-up areas.But under the new rules 1-month bans will be mandatory for anyone caught speeding by more than 25kmh (16mph) or 20kmh (12mph) in town.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside michael sobell hospice coronavirus lockdown pictures","story":"Paul Grover for the  Coronavirus latest news: Don\u0026#39t pay for crisis with public sector cuts, Labour pleadsSavvy isolated seniors ride new technology wave in lockdownWhen will UK lockdown end?

When prime minister Benjamin Disraeli arranged for Queen Victoria to become Empress of India in 1877, he could not have flattered his monarch more yet today “imperialism” is used almost exclusively as a pejorative. I don’t think that it’s sufficient for us today simply to assume that we are morally superior to our ancestors (still less that we have achieved moral perfection). We need to understand how people at the time believed that they were doing good, as they created the world’s largest ever empire.A population that had been brought up studying the history of Rome did not think empires bad. The Romans had “civilised” Europe, spreading their literature, architecture and civil engineering. The emperors had latterly become Christian and when Rome was at last overrun by “barbarians”, a long “Dark Age” followed. Such thinking may have influenced those who saw a need to convert other people to Christianity.“We seem … to have conquered and peopled half the world in a fit of absence of mind,” wrote a historian at the end of the 19th century. There is much truth in that, although the English took some deliberate steps, such as when Elizabeth I, in 1583, granted Walter Raleigh a charter to found a colony (Virginia), or when Oliver Cromwell’s navy seized Jamaica from Spain in 1655. But Massachusetts was founded not by government but by religious refugees, while the colonisation of Canada and India was driven forward by private companies and Australia developed, accidentally, from penal colonies.Having grabbed Jamaica, England lacked the means to defend it and recruited pirates for the task. From Port Royal, the “privateers” set out to plunder Spanish ships. Given Great Britain’s weakness, it was a diplomatic coup in 1670 to wring from Spain recognition of its Caribbean and Atlantic colonies in return for suppressing piracy.The island required a new economic activity. The climate was ideal for sugar but deemed too harsh for white workers, so enslaved people were brought from West Africa to Jamaica (and Virginia too). In the seventeenth century, few people regarded slavery as a moral issue. It had been practised during all of history. Africans had enslaved other Africans. Barbary pirates had seized white Christians. Arab traders had systematically plundered Africa for slaves.However, the European powers enslaved Africans on an industrial scale. According to one estimate, the British shipped 3.4 million people to its colonies, second only to Portugal, out of a total of more than 12 million seized and transported across the Atlantic during the 16th and 19th centuries. The Caribbean islands were, for some time, Britain’s most prized colonies, and the profits helped to launch the industrial revolution.Britain suffered one of its worst humiliations with the loss of its 13 colonies that declared independence in 1776 and became the United States. Americans had established impressive representative systems of government (the Virginia General Assembly has been making laws since 1619), and they had developed a creed of liberty that drew on British political philosophers. The revolutionaries rejected not only Crown misrule but monarchy and aristocracy.Many Americans who opposed the revolution headed across the northern border and subsequent waves of immigrants from the British Isles into Canada established it as a monarchist stronghold. After the British Empire abolished the slave trade in 1807, and slavery from 1834, British Canada represented a moral rebuke to the US, where human bondage continued.The British in southern Africa fell victim to colossal greed. Both they, and the earlier Dutch settlers, known as Boers, regarded the lands as uninhabited, whereas in fact they were seized from indigenous peoples. The British battled first the Zulus and then the Boers, when gold was found in their settlements. Our resort to concentration camps to hem in the indigenous and Boer populations, with massive loss of life, remains one of the most disgraceful episodes in our history. Perhaps weakened by shame, after that war the British negotiated with the Boers a constitution for South Africa that segregated the populations on racial lines and granted to blacks only a tiny portion of the land. The origins of Apartheid clearly lie in the British colonial period.India was described by the British as the jewel in the imperial crown. That was not just because of its fabulous wealth, much of which was exported by the British East India Company or purloined by its corrupt managers. It was in India that Britain established the most perfect form of empire.After the Indian rebellion of 1857 the East India Company was sacked. The second sons of great families who thereafter went to administer the Raj dedicated their lives to the place, as did those of lesser rank who managed railways, post offices or settled as missionaries. You can argue that the ministries and railways were created so that a tiny number of whites could control a vast population of brown-skinned people. Undoubtedly so. However, those measures unified hundreds of ethnic groups and so created India (which then included Pakistan, Bangladesh and Burma). Peoples who spoke thousands of different languages acquired a common tongue: English. It is telling that Gandhi depended on the British-built railways to spread the message of independence, spoke in English, and employed his mastery of English law to embarrass the Raj.In the 21st century, we rightly condemn imperialism (and there remain plenty of current examples). The British began to repent long ago, leading the world away from slavery and closing down the rapacious East India Company. But it is important to understand that much that was done in the name of empire was regarded at the time as laudable, not wicked: it is important because, otherwise, we may think that we today have achieved “virtue”, whereas our values will surely prove as transitory as our ancestors’.“Portillo’s Empire Journey” starts on Channel 5 from this Friday at 9pmMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"teachers should not go work june 1 feel unsafe unions say","story":"The two largest teacher unions have told their members that they should not go to work on June 1 if they feel unsafe.The Prime Minister announced his strategy to end lockdown by asking teachers to prepare for the return of pupils in Reception, Year One and Year Six at the start of next month.He said that it is the Government’s “ambition” that primary schools will be open for children of all ages by the end of June so they can have one month of lessons before the summer holidays.But on Tuesday evening the country\u0027s biggest teacher union chiefs criticised Boris Johnson\u0027s plan.The National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) said it has “serious and fundamental” concerns about the Government’s plans to begin the phased reopening of primary schools next month.Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of NASUWT, described the Department for Education’s advice for schools as “inadequate” and “incomplete”.Following talks on Tuesday night with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, Dr Roach said he was left unconvinced that reopening schools on June 1 would be safe.“No teacher should be expected to go into a school that is not safe and until it can be demonstrated that it is safe to do so and we will be continuing to support and advise members on that basis,” he said. “We are reminding members there is no obligation on any schools to extend their opening arrangements.”  Dr Roach said that June 1 is “neither a fixed nor hard and fast date” by which all schools must open, adding that there is currently “no requirement or obligation” for schools to reopen then.  He was joined by Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Education Union, who told his members not to “engage” with plans to reopen schools.  Trade unions can only call for industrial action if they hold a ballot where the majority of their members vote in favour of a strike.However, The  understands the NEU could cite employment laws which states that employees have the inidual right to refuse to go into a workplace if they believe there is a “serious and imminent danger”.“If such a situation does arise in a school or college our members will continue working from home as they have been over the last six weeks,” a spokesman for the union said, adding: “The government has stated that Covid-19 is an imminent danger.”Meanwhile, headteacher union chiefs told their members that ultimately it was their decision, along with their governing bodies, whether or not to reopen.The Department for Education (DfE) published detailed guidelines on Monday evening about how primary schools and nurseries should operate when they reopen next month.Reception, Year One and Year Six pupils should be allowed to return on June 1, the Government said, with the ambition that all primary school children will be back in the classroom by the end of the month.  Class sizes should be split in half with a 15-pupil limit, and a one-way system operated in corridors, the guidelines say.  The beginning and end of the day will be staggered to avoid congestion at the gates, and surfaces should be regularly cleaned.  If a child displays coronavirus symptoms and tests positive, the rest of their class, as well as their teacher, would need to self-isolate and would all be offered free tests.  But some elements of the guidelines were criticised as “absurd”. According to the advice document, schools and nurseries should “remove soft furnishings, soft toys and toys that are hard to clean”.  Prof Colin Diamond, a former DfE advisor, said that this “feels cruel” adding: “This to me illustrates the absurdity of trying to introduce a safe regime which has to be socially distant. Of course children need cuddly toys and to relax on cushions.“This is not a very impressive idea. I can’t help but think that whoever wrote the guidance doesn’t know much about a nursery or classroom.”  The National Association of Headteachers, which is the largest union for primary school leaders, also said that removing soft furniture and toys would be difficult.  “Early Years settings and classrooms are built around small interactive toys and resources,” a spokesman said. “Removing these entirely, whilst maintaining age appropriate provision, will prove an enormous challenge.”A DfE spokesman said: “We want children back in schools as soon as it is safe to do so because it is the best place for them to learn and benefit from important social interactions.  “Plans for a phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, have been drawn up in close consultation with the sector and are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making.  “We have engaged with the unions throughout the past seven weeks and will continue to do so, including to develop further guidance for the sector.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 13th may 2020","story":"Visual Science has produced the most scientifically accurate, detailed, and at atomic resolution 3D model of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of JulyThe chancellor’s announcement on Tuesday that the furlough scheme will be extended was almost universally welcomed. However, the fact that employers will have to start contributing in August to the wages of furloughed workers will mean tough decisions for many companies. Some jobs will undoubtedly go, as government wage support is withdrawn by the end of October.Questions remain about how exactly that support will be withdrawn. Rishi Sunak has promised they will be answered by the end of the month. It’s at that time that many employers will face tough decisions.“After that I don’t know.“Does it give you worries? Yes it does, definitely. I don’t think I’m going to get any proper work until the end of July because the government is paying the 80 per cent.“I think the moment my employer has to put their hands in their pocket they will have a decision to make, definitely.”There are many variables in that decision, says Mr Curley. One option is redundancy\u0026nbspperhaps some staff could be brought back part time as the more flexible furlough rules will allow from 1 August.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBut the upheavals wrought by the virus are likely to wrench entire sectors of the economy from their roots, leaving some occupations in doubt, including Mr Curley’s.He and his colleagues chauffeur well-heeled executives between the boardrooms and glass skyscrapers of the City of\u0026nbspLondon, and the hedge-funds HQs that squeeze into opulent townhouses in Mayfair and St James’s.Those CEOs have flown over — business class, or first perhaps — on financial roadshows, touting their companies to investors.“There is no way that type of business is coming back this side of Christmas,” says Mr Curley.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?“It’s an expense for any company to take executives out for days to go around London, Frankfurt, Edinburgh, maybe Madrid. That’s a long time for senior people to be out.”“Whether it comes back ever is the $64,000 question.”Given the switch that many companies have made to using video-conferencing software, the continued concerns about spreading the virus and the pressure to reduce emissions, executive travel is forecast to drop off drastically.So might his employer keep him on? He suspects that, come August, the government might pay 50 to 60 per cent of his wage while his employer will have to pay 20 to 30 per cent. It may consider it’s not worth it.But Mr Curley is philosophical: “Furlough can’t go on forever and everyone knows that.“If the government mandates that employers have to start forking out 30 per cent of the wage bill while a lot of things are still shut down that will bring pain, without a shadow of doubt.”It also raises the question of whether the government is effectively subsidising jobs whose long-term future is in doubt. And how it deals with those potentially large numbers of workers who — despite its best efforts — are left without work when the support is withdrawn.The job retention scheme has been widely praised because it keeps those ties between workers and jobs. It prevents the destruction of productivity that results when businesses go under, people are put on the dole, ties are severed\u0026nbspand skills go to waste.In short, it helps to prevent\u0026nbspa painful but relatively short-term shock turning into\u0026nbsplong-term depression.But if the economy that emerges from the global pandemic is radically different to the one that entered it, many of the jobs and skills that are needed will be different, leaving a very difficult set of tasks for the Treasury to navigate. The\u0026nbsplaissez-faire\u0026nbspapproach that previous Conservative governments took to shifts in employment needs is well remembered in what was once known as Labour’s red wall.A somewhat easier call for Sunak, and one that has been universally welcomed by businesses, is the renewed flexibility of the furlough scheme. Instead of having to stop working for an employer completely while being entitled to furlough support, people can begin to go back to work part time.Rishi Sunak’s furlough scheme reforms look reasonablePrivately, many people admit that they have already been doing some work for their employer while the government has picked up the tab for wages. It is an obvious problem with the incentives of the scheme that has now been fixed.It will also allow those sectors completely shut down, like tourism, to gradually reopen, testing the waters with limited staff as demand slowly picks up.For Janet, who works for a group of holiday homes in the West Country, the furlough has saved an industry that she loves.“Initially it was a relief. It was going to be for a month but it’s been extended. I would personally rather be back at work.“Some people I know are struggling to get by on 80 per cent of their wages, but it is a very generous scheme overall.”The option to bring people back part-time is hugely welcome, she says, because it means that an important part of the economy can prepare itself for when it is allowed to welcome visitors again.Every day lost of the crucial summer season puts the hospitality industry under additional\u0026nbspthreat. If parts of the industry do not survive, the damage could be long lasting in areas\u0026nbspof the UK where options for new employment are limited.“Businesses will need to start to get up and ready to welcome visitors again,” says Janet. “You can’t just open your doors one day and everyone comes through the door.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But that has to be compared to the counterfactual – the cost of those millions of workers going onto the dole and universal credit. It has to be set, too, against what would have been the damage to the productive capacity of our economy of all those decent companies going under, of all those company-specific skills of laid-off workers being wasted.So: a good thing. But, at some point, most analysts accept that the furlough scheme risks being counterproductive.As the lockdown eases more business will be able to, at least partially, reopen. But the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme doesn’t allow furloughed employees to work part time, thus creating a financial incentive for managers to keep workers on the programme rather than bringing them back into action. That’s not in the interests of workers, their employers\u0026nbspor the wider economy.It’s also likely that, at some point, the scheme will be keeping alive some firms that simply have no viable post-crisis future. That too is damaging for inidual workers locked into these “zombie” companies and, again, for the wider economy.Yet, all this said, withdrawing the support too early could be lethal for some long-term viable businesses which are likely to see reduced custom due to\u0026nbspsocial distancing well into the future – think of pubs and restaurants – even as other parts of the economy are able to open up.Balancing all that is the almost nightmarish challenge for policymakers.So how do\u0026nbspRishi Sunak’s latest announced reforms to the furlough scheme measure up to the challenge?The one-month extension of the current scheme to the end of July buys a little more time for companies that need to make decisions on starting redundancy processes – or not – now.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Employers will be asked to share more of the burden of furloughed workers’ wages, which, again, seems a reasonable tweak to incentives.And the 80 per cent floor for furloughed or partially furloughed workers’ wages – regardless of whether government or employers foot the bill – shows a commendable political priority of maintaining the living standards of employees.In all, it seems a reasonable stab by the chancellor at striking a balance between protection and reforming incentives – as attested by the broad support of unions and employers’ groups for the reforms.But, of course, we await the important details – due at the end of this month – of how the relative contributions of employer and state to wages will change.And won’t know for sure whether it’s the right balance until the reforms kick in and we see the response on the ground.The chancellor, sensibly, didn’t rule out extending the scheme beyond October if necessary. That\u0026nbspmay be the most encouraging sign.In the face of a historically unprecedented economic emergency one of the key policy objectives has be retaining flexibility.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Scientists think there is probably many more flying past Earth that are never seen, simply because they are too small and moving too quickly to spot in the night sky.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat also means that astronomers\u0027 view of any objects they do see is very limited. If researchers do manage to spot an object before it has moved on out of our solar system, their view is usually limited, and that challenge means that objects such as \u0027Oumuamua are still shrouded in mystery.“There are a lot of fundamental challenges with observing\u0026nbspISOs\u0026nbspfrom Earth — they are usually so small that light from the sun needs to illuminate it in a certain way for our telescopes to even detect it,” said Richard\u0026nbspLinares, an assistant professor in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AeroAstro) at\u0026nbspMIT, in a statement.The comet that took 100 million years to pass Earth“And they are\u0026nbsptravelling\u0026nbspso fast that it’s hard to pull together and launch a mission from Earth in the small window of opportunity we have before it’s gone. We’d have to get there fast, and current propulsion technologies are a limiting factor.”Researchers would be able to learn vastly more about such objects if they were able to actually visit one, if only with a spacecraft. Scientists have offered a grand plan to try and get up close to such an object, and learn more about it.The plan would involve launching a set of static satellites, or statites, that would be put in place around the solar system. They would wait in a kind of hibernation\u0026nbspuntil an interstellar object was detected, and then leap into action to hunt it down and get up close.The MIT scientists propose that the satellites would be powered by a solar sail that would be precisely calculated to allow it to avoid being pulled in by the Sun\u0027s gravity, because it would also be pushed away by solar radiation, allowing it to stay still and ready to spring into life. Such a design would also allow it to slingshot towards any interstellar object and catch up with it as it flies.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

We could also learn how quickly and how commonly objects transit between solar systems, which will tell us the feasibility of the interstellar transfer of life.”The plan has received approval from the\u0026nbspNASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Program, which gives funding to innovative new ideas that could change future space missions. It is currently on Stage 1 of that process, and the MIT scientists say they will work over the coming months to create a proof-of-concept and then hopefully develop those ideas in the future.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

According to property website Zoopla, around 373,000 property transactions across the UK, with a total value of £82bn, have been put on hold due to lockdown measures.Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said the measures covered “each aspect of the sales and letting process from viewings to removals”.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?He added: “Our step-by-step plan is based on the latest guidance to ensure the safety and protection of everyone involved.“This critical industry can now safely move forward, and those waiting patiently to move can now do so.”Recent research by Savills found that, while prospective buyers at the top end of the market have become less committed to moving in the near term, the experience of Covid-19 has made them more determined to move within the next couple of years.Meanwhile, builders will be given the freedom to negotiate start times with local authorities to ensure workers can head to a site at a staggered pace, while local councils and developers will be able to publicise planning applications through social media instead of having to rely on posters and leaflets.In addition, smaller developers will be allowed to defer payments to local councils in a measure designed to ensure local infrastructure continues to be built.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation.

Absolutely workplaces need to follow the guidelines on making a workplace safe for Covid, so that is very important.“Critically, everybody who can work from home should continue to work from home.”Asked for a second time whether people are protected by law if they felt unsafe in the workplace, the health secretary\u0026nbspsaid: “Well, employment law has not changed, but that isn’t the point.“The point is that businesses and employees should be working together to make the best of a very difficult situation.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

austerity, and questioned whether enough inspectors would be available to mount the necessary safety checks.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?Mr Sharma’s Business Department has released guidance, drawn up in consultation with industry and unions, on safety measures in\u0026nbspeight workplace settings now allowed to operate, from construction sites to factories and takeaways.Companies aiming to reopen must carry out Covid-19 risk assessments, redesign workplaces to allow two-metre distancing and introduce more frequent cleaning. They are advised to consider staggering shift times, imposing one-way routes round premises and reorganising desks and work-stations so employees face away from each other.Speaking at the daily 10 Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Mr Sharma urged employers to follow the guidance and work with unions and staff “to keep each other safe”.And he added: “To workers I say: we are looking out for you, we want you to feel confident that you are financially supported and returning to a safe workplace.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“Because in this time, like no other, we all need to work together safely as we rebuild our economy.”Mr Sharma told the briefing: “Employers have a duty to keep employees safe in the workplace – that is absolutely enshrined in law.“If somebody feels their workplace is not safe, they have to take that up with their employer.“If they don’t feel they are getting any traction they absolutely should get in touch with the Health and Safety Executive or the local authority.”Spelling out the HSE’s powers, Ms Albon said: “Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things – enforcement notices, requiring them to take particular kinds of action.“In the most extreme circumstances if there is a risk of serious injury to an inidual employee they can issue a notice which prohibits certain activities from taking place.“Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offence and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing.”Mr Johnson has said he does not expect a “flood” of people to return to work this week, following new guidance that encourages those who are unable to do their jobs at home to be ready to go to\u0026nbspfactories and construction sites from Wednesday.But unions have voiced concern that staff may feel pressured to turn up, even if they are worried about the risk of infection in their workplace or while commuting by\u0026nbsppublic transport.The general secretary of the Prospect union, Mike Clancy, said that the HSE’s funding boost would not make up for 10 years of cuts which had left it with fewer than 500 main grade inspectors across the UK.“The new money will presumably partly be used to fund new inspectors but capacity is needed as soon as possible,” said Mr Clancy.“How are the existing inspectors expected to do the required inspections, while also training new inspectors? And will these new inspectors be permanent positions?“All these are questions the government must answer urgently so that workers know they will be able to return to work safely and that their workplace will be adequately regulated.”In the House of Commons, Labour’s shadow business secretary Ed Miliband challenged Mr Sharma to confirm that “workers who have a reasonable belief that they will be in danger do not have to be at work”.Official statistics showed that construction workers are more likely to die from coronavirus than average members of the public, he said.“It is the highest-paid workers who will generally carry on being able to work from home and lower-paid workers who are being asked to go back to work,” said Mr Miliband.“Whatever the economic pressures, their health must be protected. They deserve to be safe and that is what the government must take every action to ensure.”Health and Safety Executive\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailVolunteers are being sought in locations including London and Coventry.One advert states that they are seeking to recruit “up to 1,000” volunteers and current Boots staff to fill the roles across the country.Boots is assisting the government in the recruitment of volunteers, but it is thought that the guidelines have been set by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).Sources close to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that volunteers had been used to great effect throughout the coronavirus crisis.They added that the volunteers would receive training on how to carry out the tests. Iniduals using home kits are currently self-administering the swabs with no training.Sara Gorton, head of health at Unison, said: “Many people want to give their spare time to the NHS to help it through the Covid crisis, but this advert takes the notion of volunteering way too far.”She added that rather than “seeking to take advantage of people’s good nature, the government would be better placed utilising the experience of NHS staff returning from retirement, or the healthcare students in their final years, to help expand the UK’s testing capacity”.Andy McDonald, a member of the shadow cabinet, said: “This is physically and mentally demanding work which should be paid, with terms, conditions and rights negotiated and agreed with trade unions.”Sir Ed Davey, acting co-leader of the Lib Dems, said: “The British public are going above and beyond in their efforts to slow the spread of the virus – whether it is working on the frontline, helping the vulnerable, supporting their local charities or simply following the lockdown measures in place.“This does not mean the government should try to take advantage of these efforts by not paying those who will be testing for the virus.”He added that those performing the tests should be formally employed, trained, paid and\u0026nbspreceive the benefits that come with employment.“At a time when thousands are experiencing financial hardship, to expect iniduals to work unpaid, whilst taking considerable risks to their health, is a scandal. The government must rectify this immediately otherwise their testing rollout will become another shambles even before it’s begun.”Boots declined to comment on Tuesday night and directed enquiries to the DHSC.A DHSC spokesperson said: “The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by fantastic teamwork between the government, key private companies and amazing volunteers.“Meeting the 100,000 target was a fantastic achievement, but it isn’t the end of the goal, it’s just the beginning.“We will continue to expand our testing capacity, with thousands more tests becoming available every day.

It includes tests that were posted out.\u0026nbspWe’re told 31,587 people have died. No they haven’t. It’s far more than that.”The professor, also chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, continued: “I think this is not a trustworthy communication of statistics. It’s such a missed opportunity. There’s a public out there who are broadly very supportive of the measures, they’re hungry for details, for facts, for genuine information.How to be productive if you have to work from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsShould you be taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to treat coronavirus?What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“And yet they get fed this, what I call number theatre, which seems to be coordinated really much more by No 10’s communications team, rather than genuinely trying to inform people about what’s going on.”He added: “I just wish the data was being brought together and presented by people who really knew its strength and limitations and could treat the audience with some respect.”When asked by Marr later on the programme whether, in response to the criticism, the government would rethink the way they present the numbers, communities secretary Robert Jenrick said: “Well, I’m sure there’s ways we can improve these press conferences.“They continue to get large audiences, but they’re designed to inform the public. If there are better ways of presenting the numbers – and I very strongly respect the professor – if we can do that, we should and will do that.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is thought he is going\u0026nbspto drop the government’s “stay at home” messaging in favour of “stay alert” – sparking further accusations of mixed messaging and immediate rejections from Scotland and Wales.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In other words, it’s multiple shots on goal. This will be important, because this will be good for global availability, if we have more than one successful candidate,” he said.The Trump administration is attempting to fast-track the development and production of a vaccine for the Covid-19 that would give the US the ability to inoculate 300m people by January 2021.The administration is calling the Manhattan Project-style vaccination programme “Operation Warp Speed,” Bloomberg News reported in April, and is hoping to cut the time before rolling out an effective vaccine to the masses by as many as eight months.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreakThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusQuarantine: What do new UK travel guidelines mean for my holidays?As part of that plan, the administration is moving ahead with production of the vaccines “at risk”, meaning that companies will be manufacturing large quantities of doses before scientists know for certain whether they’re effective.“We’ll be investing considerable resources in developing doses, even before we know any given candidate or candidates work,” Mr Fauci\u0026nbspsaid. “I must warn that there’s also the possibility of negative consequences, where certain vaccines can actually enhance the negative effect of the infection,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The price of the raw materials that many export have plummeted too.

Sharma was appointed in  as the PMs Infrastructure Envoy to India and Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from July  to June .He was very involved in setting up Readings first free school, and campaigned to let Gurkhas settle permanently in the UK.Sharma is married with two daughters, and says he is a big supporter of local businesses.Hes a qualied chartered accountant who - prior to entering Parliament - worked with Coopers  Lybrand Deloitte.Sharma also spent nearly two decades in the banking sector, based in London, Stockholm and Frankfurt.Speaking to reporters this afternoon, as part of the daily update on coronavirus, the Business Secretary said red tape will be reduced to allow new producers of hand sanitiser to bring products to market in a matter of days.More than , people have died from the coronavirus in the UK, and over , have been diagnosed with the disease.From Downing Street, Alok Sharma added: We are also introducing a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, to protect frontline NHS staff.And were removing administrative barriers to the production of hand sanitiser.Sharma said that the PM is showing mild symptoms of the killer bug, and he continues to lead the government effort in combating covid-.The fact that Johnson was also hit by the new virus showed that no one is immune and its precisely why we ask people to follow the government advice in terms of staying at home, when youre absolutely able to do that.We want to make sure we protect the NHS and ultimately save lives, he added.The politician said the governments measures would be led by scientic and medical advice, and he thanked businesses for acting responsibly - including the many which have temporarily closed.Commenting on firms in the the manufacturing sector which continue to operate, he urged employers to follow Public Health England guidelines and keep employees safe.But, he said that firms seemed to be adapting.Sharma added: We are doing everything we can to support businesses and our people.The politician was also grilled on repatriating Brits still stranded overseas during the pandemic.He replied that officials are working night and day to get them back from around the world, including repatriation flights - such as a chartered one which arrived from Peru yesterday. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

and you can even tape down some wire to stfen the mask,you have any.Finish by punching holes in each end and threading elastic through to fit around your ears.If you dont have elastic bands you could also use a hair tie.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the T-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.Here we take a look at some of the dferent types of face mask and how well they work...N respiratorsN masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient.The N stands for Not resistant to oil because the mask only protects against particles, not fluids, while the  means it filters out  per cent of airborne particles.They generally have an eight-hour shelf le before becoming clogged depending on the work youre doing.As they offer so much protection, they are used by doctors and nurses in a medical setting.However, they have not been recommended for use to the general public yet due to supply issues for health workers.Surgical masksThese disposable three-ply masks are fluid-resistant and theyre the most common type of facial protection youll see health care staff wearing.They are used to prevent infected droplets from doctors, nurses and carers entering the respiratory system of the patient.Although they dont have built-in air filters, they are considered effective enough for most staff outside of intensive care.The nose clip can be bent to fit snugly around the nose, however they are a loose fit and the material gapes at the sides so they dont protect against all particles.When they become wet, theyre effectiveness is also reduced.Also, they are disposable and are only intended to be worn once.DIY dust masks Found in most hardware stores, dust masks can offer some level of protection from particles -worn correctly.If it says FFP then it’s a basic kind of dust mask and offers the lowest level of filtration for this kind of respirators mask.To meet European standards, they have to be able to filter at least  per cent of particles - with FFP filtering  per cent.That means that it can’t filter out tiny particles associated with viruses and bacteria.You can also get a FFP mask, which looks similar but has a small filter in the middle to catch almost all airborne particles.Short of being a full gas mask it offers the best protection - as long as it fits properly - and is more effective than N as well as the FFP and FFP.Cycling masksThese are generally worn by cyclists to prevent them from breathing in pollution in heavy traffic.Usually made from neoprene, they fit tightly to the face and are intended to offer a level of protection from airborne particles.Some are also marketed as N, or N grade, which means the amount of filtered airbone particles is either  or  per cent.Homemade masksAs many people cant get their hands on a mask, some have turned to fashioning their own.Theres been tips on using vacuum cleaner bags and even sanitary towels to cover your face.While most wont be as effective as anything you can buy in a store, they will offer more protection than not covering your face at all.Research by Public Health England in  looked at the suitability of household materials that could be used as masks to filter bacterial and viral aerosols and found vacuum bags actually worked well.Experts say that you should aim for multiple layers - a double layer of tightly-woven cotton with a thread count of at least  was one of the best barriers, according to researchers in the US.Even a bandana, scarf or T-shirt can be used to cover your nose and mouth while in public. Experts have previously said in order for the use of face coverings to be effective, nine in  people need to wear them.The Government document states face coverings should not be used by children under the age of two, people with respiratory conditions as well as those who could find it hard to wear them correctly such as primary school age children.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Many other countries are asking its citizens to wear a mask, such as France and the US.Although people in the UK are not being advised to wear masks, they are now being advised to wear face coverings on public transport or in shops.Scotland has recommended people use face coverings , for example fabric such as a scarf, to cover their nose and mouth.Northern Ireland has issued the same advice on face coverings.There are worries inside the NHS thatthe UK government change the policy and advise all Brits wear a mask it could mean there wouldnt be enough for health workers.The UK government has said asking people to wear face coverings isnt the same as asking people to wear face masks.Speaking on May , the UK governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease. There were just  deaths.In  Mystic Neil warned that million could die worldwide from bird flu. The final number was .More recently, the randy epidemiologist predicted that Sweden’s relaxed attitude to the virus would lead to , dead Swedes by May . The number was ,.If the sex-mad scientist has been so wrong in the past, then why did the Government gullibly assume that Ferguson was so right about Covid- Common sense should have told us Ferguson is just a fallible scientist who has previously peddled flawed extrapolations — not some bespectacled Yoda. And from the reluctance to close our airports to mistaking Ferguson for God, we have sometimes been short of good old British common sense in recent weeks.Tonight Boris addresses the nation on plans to start very gently easing the lockdown. Many people are understandably worried about going out into the world again.So many have died. So many families have been shattered. So many of the bravest and the best have paid the ultimate price for caring for strangers.But are we really the sick man of Europe Despite our horric death count, this country can feel proud of the way it has conducted itself during this national emergency. Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage.

I wanted him to die,” she told Channel  cheerleaders.The Harry Potter star is the authentic voice of Corbynistas who loathe this Prime Minister with a visceral hatred.If they can’t dance on his grave, the Dementors will do everything possible to kill his political career.Covid- has morphed from a battle for the nation’s health into a lethal struggle to stop Boris leading Britain successfully out of lockdown.An early victory came last night, as the PM unveiled his new slow-motion escape motto.Some ministers hoped for: “Back to work. Go to school. Save the economy.”Instead we heard a feeble “Stay alert. Control the virus. Save lives.”This is a Prime Minister paralysed by indecision, kicking himself for unforced errors, terried of being blamed for every new death.Downing Street is now hostage to the health-and-safety mafia, whipped into line by opportunist public sector unions who have, to coin a phrase, taken back control.Teaching unions, already on guaranteed public sector pay, even want to restrict some online lessons for education-hungry kids.Transport unions are making Tube, rail and bus travel impossible with draconian social distancing.Health unions blame ministers for blunders made by NHS and Public Health England managers.We are in thrall to a shroud-waving public sector “blob” warning of mass fatalitiesthe Government makes one  step.We must heed the experts who swallowed “Bonking Professor” Neil Ferguson’s crackpot forecasts of half a million dead without lockdown.They are the same experts whose advice on testing, PPE and care homes led to one of the world’s biggest death tolls.The nation’s long-term physical, mental and economic health is being held to ransom by a bug which has virtually no impact on children, young adults and most people under .That same low-risk generation faces a potentially catastrophic price for a disease which should leave them and their parents free toalmost immediately to normal le.Coronavirus is an old person’s disease. Out of ten million under-s in Britain, just two have sadly died from Covid-.For under-s, the risk is a “trivial” one or two per million, says respected statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter. Little more than the chance of dying by accident.For over-s, he says the risk is “ten thousand times” as high.This is no consolation for elderly victims, but it does suggest a speedy route back to a new normal with productive under-s kick-starting the economy.Getting people back to work will be hard. The work ethic propelling us out of bed each morning has been sapped by warm spring sunshine, online food and wine and a Treasury- funded cost of living subsidy.People are enjoying paid-for-time with their families. they are also scared witless by sermons about death and disaster and Downing Street’s daily mortality rate briefings.One day there will be a public inquiry. Everyone is covering their tracks.With hindsight, global lockdown is likely to be judged a terrible mistake, forced on a panic-stricken world by China’s authoritarian example.Sweden alone rejected lockdown, keeping schools open, and the economy ticking over, yet its death toll is lower per head than Britain, France, Spain and Italy.Former Swedish medical chief, Professor Johan Giesecke, believes we overreacted to a disease which is just twice as severe as winter flu and cannot be avoided anyway.“I don’t think you can stop it,” he says, “it’s like a tsunami sweeping across Europe.“We should do what we can to slow it so the health service can cope, but let it pass.”But he won’t say this in public.He will have seen the bizarre charges of betrayal and “fat shaming” against singer Adele for daring to lose seven stone.Yet Liverpool University researchers say obesity increases the risk of death from coronavirus by  per cent.Boris should say loud and clear that fat can be fatal. Losing weight prolongs le.Our health service, by the way, has coped brilliantly.Prof Giesecke says there are three golden rules: “Wash your hands, keep social distance, trust the people.”After Brexit, Boris should know more than most he can trust the people.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government cannot afford to repeat such a shambles.“Stay home, save lives” was a simple and effective message. The next steps are far more nuanced.They did not need another vague Churchillian rallying call. That merely sowed confusion, even among the PM’s deputy Dominic Raab and the staunchest Tories, and exposed Boris to a tsunami of snark on TV and social media.It needed instead the level of detail we eventually saw in the Government’s guidance released yesterday afternoon — and then in Boris’s Commons QA.Supporters claimed the PM’s new “stay alert” message was merely common sense any fool could grasp. That misses the point. We are being asked to live in highly unusual and restrictive ways. One person’s common sense is another’s idea of dangerous risk.Our circumstances are all dferent and specics are important — especially when police are to hand out increased fines for transgressions.But while the Government’s recent messaging has been poor, we at least now have our first welcome, albeit ­tentative, steps out of this nightmare:Outside exercise without limit, including the freedom to drive for a day out. The first chance in weeks to see a friend. All assuming social distancing.More solid guidance on masks. Precious little relief on schools, but the glimmer of some sport. Some, many Sun readers included, are being told toto work, though they may justiably fear it is unsafe.Their jobs also make them some of those most likely to die from Covid-.Their firms, factories and sites must bust a gut to ensure their safety, take every precaution and heed reasonable concerns. The grim reality, though, is that our economy must get moving again.It is typical of the infantile Left to complain that profits are being put before people. The Government is not a bottomless well of money. That’s why Rishi Sunak is limbering up to cut the sums paid to furloughed staff. He has to.Only a healthy economy and the taxes it generates can keep public services afloat, the NHS especially.Bankrupt Britain with an endless lockdown and you wreck those too. And far more lives are then lost.DONALD Trump is now harbouring an international fugitive.His case for refusing Britain’s request to extradite Harry Dunn’s alleged killer Anne Sacoolas is blown apart.The Interpol Red Notice, ordering her arrest outside the US, shows the “diplomatic immunity” under which she left the UK after the death crash was bogus.Even the US public want her to face the music.

But that’s the ambition, that’s the target that we’re setting, so at least some of the jobs will start to come back.“And then over the medium term, I’ve absolutely no doubt that the UK economy is immensely resilient and will come back. But we’re going to have to think a lot more –we can’t get a vaccine fast then we’re going to have to think a lot more how we make our businesses, our lives Covid-secure while continuing with economic activity. But we’re a very ingenious bunch, the Brits, I’m sure we’ll find ways forward, and that is what we intend to do.”But Labour has urged him not to cut the scheme too soon - for fear of harming the economy and for jobs to be lostThe Resolution Foundation urged him to keep the scheme open longer for workers in the hardest hit sectors in order to acknowledge the Government’s roadmap revealed some sectors will have to stay shut for at least the rest of this year.It also wants the Government to allow partial furloughing from June onwards - enabling employees toto work for some hours, while still receiving  per cent of their wages for the hours that they remained furloughed.Currently the scheme requires furloughed employees not to be working at all in order to qualy for the scheme.The Federation of Small Businesses have long-campaigned for employers to furlough staff part-time. FSB boss Mike Cherry said last night: “The vast majority of small employers have furloughed staff and they’re telling us loud and clear that the ability to do so on a part-time basis as we move towards recovery will be key to keeping their operations afloat. For firms that don’t have the green light to open until July at the very earliest in particular, we need to see schemes extended signicantly – not least the job retention scheme.”Treasury Committee chairman Mel Stride suggested a tapering down of the furloughing scheme to protect jobs and ease the burden on the Exchequer.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to the NHS, the disease primarily affects children under five years of age.These include:Although it mainly affects children, Kawasaki disease can also be found in adults. The chances of this, however, is typically very low.The blood vessels become swollen which can lead to complications in the coronary arteries . Kawasaki disease can cause aneurysms which can lead to a heart attack and heart disease.James Bradley said he had seen a six-year-old who also had a pinkish, raised and itchy rash on their belly button and back.Speaking to the Huffington Post he added: I’ve seen other patients that it’s more like an eruption of small red bumps, which we’ve seen mostly in patients who are admitted with more serious infections going on. It’s hard for us to knowthis is a viral manestation or an immune response.On the increased number of patients presenting with Covid toes he said a lot of such skin manestations are a representation of what is going on internally with the organs.Covid toes can be found on the side or sole of the foot and in some cases has been seen on hands and fingers.The European Journal of Pediatric Dermatology said there had been a epidemic of cases in Italy involving children and young adults.It is a condition that had not previously been linked to the virus.Bradley added that when you get blueish and reddish toes, it’s either thrombosis or damage to the vessels.Other specialists have claimed that there are a iety of skin issues to look out for and said skin conditions in Covid patients can be “extraordinarily erse”.Dermatologist Harold Lancer said hive-like rashes are the most common conditions he has seen.At the beginning of this month there were numerous reports of children experiencing rashes and developing Kawasaki like symptoms.The condition causes inflation in the blood and can present during or after a Covid infection.Doctors have said that such rashes can be present in people who are not suffering from any other Covid symptoms and data from both China and Italy, two of the first hot spots of the virus, states that two to  percent of patients also had skin conditions.While it’s important to seek help from medical professionalsyou think you have the coronavirus, specialists also say that what you have put onto your skin can also cause reactions.During the pandemic many people may have had to switch their usual brands of washing detergent and shower products due to a lack of availability, while others may have taken the opportunity to try something new in their skin care regime.Dermatologists have said to keep a log of any new medication you may have been taking or anything new you have been using on your skin in order to determine whether it is in fact this that has caused a reaction.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Therefore, its crucial that we protect our network by minimising the pressures placed upon it and ensure its ready to serve those who most need it.The guidance acknowledges: There may be situations where you cant keep a suitable distance from people.In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people.The risk of infection increases the closer you are to another person with the virus and the amount of time you spend in close contact.Mr Shapps also revealed the Government is working with travel apps so Brits knowits too busy to travel safely at certain times.He said: In addition we are working with app companies, Google, Microsoft, people like the british company Citymapper or Trainline to work on crush data to be published to enable people to see where the busiest parts of the network are.If you go on public transport you should wear a mask or face covering and keep two metres from other travellers, it advises.It is not legally required that commuters do so, but the Government now urges anyone in shops or on public transport to use onethey cant stay apart from others.But it comes as Wales health minister said that the Welsh government would not be recommending the wearing of face masks in public.Mr Vaughan Gething said the use of non-medical masks should only be a matter of personal choice.Wales chief medical officer Dr Frank Atheron also claimed that there may a shortage of clinical masks for people on the front linethe public began to use them too.It marked yet another moment of confusion as England and the other nations in the UK begin to take dferent approaches to dealing with the next stage of the pandemic.To cut down any chance of overcrowding, it is also recommended employers should be able to offer more flexible start times to try and avoid everyone piling onto public transport at rush hour.This will help reduce the crowds and keep travelling as safe as possible - as normal services have not yet resumed and are still reduced.Wash your hands as soon as you can after travelling anywhere, and before you head out of the front door. If you see hand sanitising stations anywhere, use them, the guidance says.Using contactless payment wherever you can reduces the risk of contracting any germs, and only take what you really need with you so you dont have to lug about a big bag, and it wont take up space on the trains.Take note of any signs directing where you should and shouldnt sit, and stick to them, while trying not to touch any surfaces you dont have to.If you do, do not touch your face and wash or sanitise your hands as soon as you can.It is wise to plan your journey in advance so you know the route well and dont have to spend any longer on public transport or in a more crowded area than you need to.If you are driving to and from work, be aware there are likely to be more cyclists and pedestrians about.And anyone who needs to use airports will need to be aware of mask rules in certain spots, after three British airports now require all passengers to cover their faces.Manchester, Stansted and East Midlands airports have decided to impose the conditions, and some airlines are also planning to introduce this as a rule.But while lockdown is slowly easing the rules still state thatyou do not need to leave home to work, or leave home at all, then you shouldnt.Brits are now able to exercise as much as they wish outdoors, while only with members of their households still and keeping socially distanced.From tomorrow lockdown weary Brits will be able to meet up with one other person from outside their household - keeping two metres from each other outdoors - as the country continues to battle the virus.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: Transport operators and staff have been working hard to ensure that people who need to get to work are able to do so, including crucial NHS workers and all those on the frontline of the fight against the virus. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-DEATHS-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AG-CASES-CHART--MAY-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Alongside the cycling and walking revolution we are launching, and clear guidance to passengers and operators published today, we can all play our part by following the advice and reducing pressure on public transport.If we take these steps, all those who need to use public transport should feel confident that they can do.Britains real coronavirus death toll has passed ,, concerning new analysis suggests. There were , deaths involving Covid- in England and Wales up to May , according to the Office of National Statistics .It comes as yesterday ministers revealed a fresh five-step plan to try and keep all workplaces safe from coronavirus. Kids could be sent to dferent schools and class sizes cut in half under plan to exit lockdown, it was revealed yesterday.And all school kids in England will be sent back to class for a month before the summer holidays.Class sizes will be slashed to no more than , and pupils sat apart to try to limit any spread of coronavirus.And No revealed that parents who refuse to send their kids back to class will not be slapped with the usual £ fines for non-attendance.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

that it wasnt effective and there werent sufficient resources. needs to rebuild contact tracing locally through teams, you will need tens of thousands of contact tracers.Professor Pollock said the country could easily utilise the , people who signed up to volunteer for the NHS, many of whom have not been contacted, to build local teams.The group said the most effective way forward would be local contact tracing -

and the Chancellor said the scheme would continue unchanged until the end of July.It is currently paying  per cent of peoples wages - up to a limit of £, per month.Full details on the scheme will be released before the end of May, Mr Sunak said.Paul Johnson, head of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the cost was staggering and was likely to reach £billion in total.It is huge, it’s more than any government spending other than the health service or welfare, he added.But already employers and Labour warned that there could be mass redundanciesemployers had to fork out huge sums upfront to keep their workers on.Shadow Chancellor Annelise Dodds said: The government must clary today when employers will be required to start making contributions, and how much they’ll be asked to pay.If every business is suddenly required to make a substantial contribution from the st August onwards, there is a very real risk that we will see mass redundancies.Treasury insiders suggested that the Government would still pay at least half of the  per cent wage bill, but did not give a specic figure of how the funds would be ided.New statistics published today revealed the job-retention scheme has protected . million workers and almost one million businesses.Speaking in the House of Commons today on his th birthday, Mr Sunak said: Until the end of July there will be no changes whatsoever.Then from August to October, the scheme will continue for all sectors and regions of the UK but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.As we reopen the economy we need to support people back to work.Between August and October, the scheme will continue but with greater flexibility to support people back to work.We will share the cost of paying peoples salaries.He added: Full details will follow by the end of May, but I want to assure people today of one thing that wont change.Workers will through the combined efforts of Government and employers continue to receive the same level of overall support as they do now at  per cent of their current salary up to £, a month.The scheme will continue throughout the four nations - even though Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not telling people to go back to work yet.All sectors will be able to get help, the Chancellor promised, not just those who desperately need assistance.One option discussed was that furlough money would be reduced to  per cent after fears that workers were addicted to the scheme, but Mr Sunak denied having used the phrase himself.Mr Sunak said: Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time.Our message is simple: we stood behind Britains workers and businesses, and we will stand behind them as we come out of it.Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme.People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, its not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home.Employers will have to promise to top up the rest of the workers wages to  per cent to continue to take part in the scheme, it was claried by officials today.They wontt be able to just give workers  per cent of their wages from the Government and not contribute anything to the restIt comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday published a -page guide on getting Britain out of lockdown.The PM gave a speech on Sunday night and followed up with a three-step plan to ease lockdown measures.Starting this week, those who cant work from home were encouraged to get back to work.The Government will also explore ways to support furloughed workers who wish to do additional training or learn new skills during this period.But critics suggested that many businesses who cant afford that will have to lay off staff rather than find the cash to top up their employers wages.However the government does not envisage making signicant payouts to public sector employees as they believe most will continue offering essential services.Where employers are receiving public funding for staff costs, they will be expected to continue using these funds to pay staff rather than applying for the furlough scheme.If you are working at reduced hours and pay, you will not be eligible for furlough and it will be up to your employer to pay you as normal.You must have created and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before March ,  and have a UK bank account. Federation of Small Business chairman, Mike Cherry said: We await further detail on the contributions that will be required of small employers after July.We need to ensure that those obligations are affordable for the many businesses that have had no revenue coming in for months now, but still have fixed overheads to worry about.And Professor Len Shackleton, IEA Editorial and Research Fellow, added: The longer businesses are dependent on the furlough scheme, and unable to begin reorganising staff and adjusting their business models, the less likely it is that people will have jobs toto once the lockdown ends.It will also delay iniduals plans to seek other jobs where this is clearly going to be necessary.It would have been better to spell out much more clearly what the government intends now, rather than delaying the detail of what Mr Sunak proposes.BCC Director General Adam Marshall warned: Over the coming months, the Government should continue to listen to business and evolve the scheme in line with what’s happening on the ground.Further support may yet be needed for companies who are unable to operate for an extended period, or those who face reduced capacity or demand due to ongoing restrictions.TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed todays news and said it was good for workers.She said: We are pleased ministers have listened to unions and extended the job retention scheme to the autumn. This will be a big relief for millions.Changing the rules to allow part-time working is key to enabling a gradual and safeto work.And maintaining the rate at  per cent is a win for the pay packets of working families.As the economic consequences of Covid- become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Non-food stores, hairdressers, car dealers and most other enterprises in the services sector remain shut, however.In a televised nationwide address, Putin said that from today he would start lting restrictions that had forced many people to work from home and businesses to temporarily close.Putin also said that unemployment had doubled to . million in a month, and he wanted to try to stop it spiralling higher.The decision comes several days after he chatted with US President Donald Trump about oil prices.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its going to take a lot of weeks and a lot of work to do that.Head of education at Unison, which represents school support staff, Jon Richards, also told its members not to make plans until there was a joint plan between the unions.A poll from the NEU suggested that a third of parents do not immediately plan to send their children back to school once lockdown measures are eased.The survey, of , parents found that nearly halfsaid they would send their children back to school as soon as it reopens, but % said they plan to delay the .Health Secretary said this morning it was completely natural for parents to worry about sending their kids back to school.He told ITV: The reason weve said what we have is actually because homeschooling and telly schooling for five- and six-year-olds, in Year  and in Reception, is much harder.We do want to make sure that education is interrupted as little as possible. Also, childcare is much more dficultyouve got a five-year-old, six-year-old or a child in pre-school. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--may-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We stood behind Britains workers and businesses as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side.”But economic experts warned that some Brits were enjoying a “paid holiday” as bosses struggled to persuade employees to .All furloughed workers will continue to be paid  per cent of their wage up to a maximum of £, a month for the time they are off work.But from August, employers will have to pay a contribution to keep staff furloughed.They will be allowed to bring staff back to work part-time — with the Government continuing to pay a portion of their wages.Economic experts claimed waiting until August to make the scheme more flexible will keep businesses and employees addicted to government wage support.So far, .million workers have been furloughed by nearly a million companies.Business bosses revealed they were already finding it dficult to persuade staff toto work and said the “situation is getting worse” the longer the scheme runs.Nicky Jolley, managing director of human resources firm HRday, said: “There are some employees who have quite enjoyed weeks off with  per cent pay.“And with beautul weather, schools closed and perhaps a partner furloughed or having lost their job, there have been some requests to remain on the scheme.“They have got a touch of ‘furlough fever’, enjoying what is, in essence, a paid holiday. Sadly, this is putting strain on businesses who need staff back.”Professor Len Shackleton, from the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: “The Chancellor’s announcement will tend to keep businesses tied to government funding for longer than strictly necessary and delay readjustment to what is a greatly changed economy.“The intention to make the Job Retention Scheme more flexible is welcome but waiting until August before asking businesses to begin sharing the cost of furloughing and encouraging employees toto work at least part-time, means billions of pounds extra taxpayer spending.”But Mr Sunak, who turned  on Tuesday, said he wanted to preserve as many people’s jobs as possible. He said: “We already know that many people have lost their jobs and it breaks my heart.”Last night, he told the BBC: “This is an expensive scheme, and Ive said that point before but I also believe its absolutely the right thing to do.”His move was welcomed by business groups and trade unions. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady called it a “big relief for millions”.The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated the scheme would eventually cost taxpayers £billion.But the public overwhelmingly backed the extension. A snap YouGov survey found  per cent for it and just ten per cent against.Businesses that must stay shut — such as gyms, nightclubs, pubs and events companies — could get special treatment, Treasury insiders said on Tuesday. But details will not be revealed until later this month.Mr Sunak left self-employed workers in the lurch after refusing to say how long a similar package will last for them.On Wednesday, the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme opens, allowing solo workers hit by the coronavirus lockdown to claim grants of up to £,.KAROLINA Cala is on furlough from her role as marketing manager for Calla Shoes in Manchester.The -year-old said: “We make shoes for women with bunions — it’s a very specialist company!“Our entire team was furloughed apart from the founder who has stayed to try and keep it going.“I love my job and can’t wait to get back.

All you need is a TV and the inclination.But while many will have used this virtual house arrest to shake off some unhealthy old habits , the reaction to Adele’s weight loss suggests that, for some, her transformation is a betrayal of everything fat activists hold dear.Of the , largely positive comments about the star losing an incredible seven stone, some sniped that she looked “unhealthy”and questioned how she lost it — the inference being that she had succumbed to having a gastric band.But as Pete Geracimo, her former personal trainer, points out: “It was never about getting super-skinny. It was about getting her healthy.”Not least, one suspects, for the benefit of her seven-year-old son Angelo. He adds: “She embraced better eating habits and committed to her fitness and ‘is sweating!’ I could not be prouder or happier for her.”Hear hear.

The truth, of course, is thatsomeone is deeply insecure about their own weight, they either pooh-pooh or, worse, lash out at the efforts of those who manage to transform their lestyle via willpower and hard slog.Far easier to do that than take a look at our own bad habits and attempt to change them. True, there are plenty of people who look overweight but are physically fit.And there are plenty of skinny malinkies who can’t run for a bus without needing oxygen. At the end of the day, being happy within yourself is not about how you look, but how you feel.Andyou feel that you are unfit thanks to lousy eating habits and lack of exercise, then you should be able to do something about it without being taken to task by those who don’t have the same self-discipline.Particularly as last week’s research from the University of Liverpool found that obesity increased the risk of dying from coronavirus by  per cent.

Earlier this week, people were struggling to stay two metres apart on public transport. It will be even busier from Wednesday, when the Government says people who cannot do their jobs from home should go back to work, even though public transport is running at just % of normal capacity in some areas. Union boss Mick Cash said the “ to work policy risks unleashing total chaos”. Mr Cash, the RMT general secretary, said: “This is a ridiculous and dangerous way to treat both staff and passengers alike and will have potentially lethal consequences. “Maintaining social-distancing on trains and Tube is a massive logistical exercise that requires planning, resources and the protection of staff managing the flows of passengers. To rush that exercise is a disgrace.” TSSA boss Manuel Cortes said: “The need for physical distancing of at least two metres means that only around % of those who used to use public transport can do so safely now – that’s why we believe that all services should continue to be reserved for key workers.” Department for Transport advice issued today said people should “avoid using public transport where possible” and urged commuters to “walk, cycle, or drive”. For those reliant on public transport, the advice conceded there “may be situations where you can’t keep a suitable distance”. It goes on: “In these cases you should avoid physical contact, try to face away from other people, and keep the time you spend near others as short as possible.” It also advises people to pay by contactless card, wear face coverings, and to cover their mouth and nosecoughing or sneezing. But Shadow Transport Secretary Jim McMahon said the advice “fails to answer the fundamental question – how do you stop the transport network being overwhelmed when it’s currently running at a fraction of capacity ” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps admitted just % of the usual space on public transport would be availablepeople kept to social-distancing rules.  He told the Commons: “We continue to ask people to only go to workthey cannot do their jobs from home – that’s because even as transport begins to revert to a full service, the two-metre distancing rule will only leave capacity for one in  passengers. “It’s crucial that we protect our network by minimising the pressures placed upon it and ensure it’s ready to serve those who most need it.”At least  bus workers have died from Covid- in London alone. Mr Shapps urged the city’s mayor Sadiq Khan to boost the number of train services “as quickly as they can” to ensure better social distancing.Mr Shapps said Transport for London would still only be able to take % of usual commuter numbers% of services were running and called on people to look for alternative transport. Mr Shapps said: “There will be times when you can’t maintain two metres – walking passed somebody or something . There is advice that we’re publishing today explaining thatyou’re not face-to-face but side-by-side, the risk factors are dferent.” He said the Government was working with tech firms such as Microsoft, Citymapper, and Trainline to integrate “crush data” into transport apps so travellers could avoid busy services. The Department of Transport guidance for travel operators admits it may be impossible for staff and passengers to keep a two metre distance. It says “where social distancing is not possible try to minimise the time spent within two metres”.  Transport bosses have warned that ramping up rail services to expand capacity to % of the normal availability would not take place until Monday. Robert Nisbet of the Rail Delivery Group said: “As well as gradually increasing services from next week and running longer trains in some places, we will be cleaning trains and stations throughout the day, every day. There will be space for as few as a tenth of the usual number of passengers so we need everyone’s help to keep trains for those who really need them so please only use the railwayyou absolutely have to.” Transport for Wales Rail said: “Our services are continuing to run for key workers and essential travel only.” A Transport for Greater Manchester spokesman said: “Train, tram and bus services have extremely limited capacity and should be kept free for key workers.” Tyne and Wearusers were told to “avoid using public transport and only make essential journeys”.  For those who had to travel, Huw Lewis, customer services director at operator Nexus, said: “Wear a face covering.“This is a small step we can all take to help fight coronavirus, by reducing the chance of passing infection to other people.”British Transport Police Assistant Chief Constable Sean O’Callaghan said people would “have to get used to a new way of travelling”.

While essential or pre-planned moves were allowed, ministers had strongly discouraged people from moving home. But that had sparked concern about the impact on the housing market.

The Business Secretary refused to say that employees can leave their workplacethey feel unsafe, instead advising worried to staff to take up their concerns with their boss. Alok Sharma urged bosses to work with employees and unions to develop safe ways of reopening following the lockdown. But he refused to say that employees should not go inthey feel unsafe.At the daily Downing Street briefing, he said he was struck by the way people have looked out for each other during the pandemic and the safety guidance issued by his department and the extension to the furlough scheme announced by the Chancellor were in keeping with that public spirit. To employers I say: use this support and guidance to know you are doing the right thing and work with your unions and workers to keep each other safe, Mr Sharma said. To workers I say: we are looking out for you, we want you to feel confident that you are financially supported and ing to a safe workplace. Because in this time, like no other, we all need to work together safely as we rebuild our economy. Chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive Sarah Albon has said the agency would come down hard on rule breakers as some people begin toto work this week following the Covid- lockdown. She told the Downing Street daily briefing on Tuesday: Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things - enforcement notices, requiring them to take particular kinds of action. In the most extreme circumstancesthere is a risk of serious injury to an inidual employee they can issue a notice which prohibits certain activities from taking place. Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offence and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing. Her comments come hours after she told a Westminster board companies that cannot abide by safety practices should not reopen.But she admitted to MPs at a select committee earlier that not one workplace has been shut down by health and safety inspectors since  coronavirus  struck, it emerged today.Since the beginning of the pandemic the HSE has not forcibly shut “any business for any reason” despite being notied of  staff deaths.

The Health and Safety Executive has not forcibly shut “any business for any reason” despite being notied of  staff deaths. HSE has received , reports of coronavirus-related occupational diseases,  of dangerous occurrences and  worker deaths through its reporting system. But HSE chief executive Sarah Albon told MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee: “We have not closed any business for any reason, whether it’s a death or any other reason. “We haven’t issued a prohibition notice on any activity.” The government announced £m of extra cash for HSE on Monday for call centre employees, inspectors and equipment. But there’s not yet a firm plan for how to spend the cash - because HSE was only told about it within hours of the information being made public, Ms Albon said. It comes despite firms preparing to welcome back workers who can’t work from home starting tomorrow. The government is “actively encouraging” people to go back in person, as long as workplaces comply with social distancing.But ministers have come under fire over possible gaps in the protection - and ministers claim workers should contact unions, bosses, ACAS or HSE, rather than government, with any disputes. Today it emerged HSE is writing to care homes reminding them to proactively report staff deaths to the regulator. Labour MP Neil Coyle said he was “very worried” about the lack of information - since far more than  care workers have died of coronavirus. Asked why the figure for reported worker deaths was so low, Ms Albon said: We have noticed that. We think it is at least likely we have had some signicant under-reporting, and that is particularly under NHS settings where we have had very, very low numbers so far reported to us. We are concerned we are not getting the numbers we expect and we have been taking that up with NHS at a national level and with inidual health authorities, and we will pursue that. Ms Albon however defended HSE’s decision not to close any firms, saying the regulator had not changed its criteria for how deaths should be investigated. She told MPs: “What an inspector would do and consider when there is an immediate death is whether there’s a remaining uncontrolled risk, that requires immediate action to ensure the ongoing immediate safety of iniduals. “We haven’t had a level of concern reported to us around inidual healthcare settings that is such that we would feel the need to intervene and prohibit them from continuing to work.” Between March  and May , HSE received , coronavirus-related queries from people concerned about their safety at work. While many of those concerns were dealt with immediately, about , were referred to inspectors for further investigation. In  cases, inspectors spoke with employers, while  were written to with orders for improvements to be made. Ms Albon said a further surge in calls is expected as people begin toto work this week.

The changes permit exercising more than once a day, sitting and sunbathing in parks and on beaches, and going for a drive. However, the vast majority of the measures imposed on March  still apply, with Boris Johnson previously warning it was not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. You can now meet up with someone from another household in the park - as long as you maintain a m distance from each other. Those who canapost work from home are also being urged toto work today. Schools and all non-essential shops will remain shut until at least June, with pubs expected to be closed beyond July. With the risk that the virus could run rampant again, the fine for breaching remaining rules has been almost doubled to £, up to a cap of £,.  And the overall message has switched from stay at home to stay alert - a situation that has prompted alarm and anger. Many say even the limited easing comes far too soon - with England still seeing thousands of new Covid- infections and hundreds of deaths per day. And Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all stopped short of easing the lockdown in the way Mr Johnson has. Labour leader Keir Starmer previously warned: This statement raises more questions than it answers. We see the prospect of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland pulling in dferent directions. The Prime Minister appears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work without a clear plan for safety or clear guidance as to how to get there without using public transport.  What the country wanted tonight was clarity and consensus, but we havenapost got either of those. The Police Federation of England and Wales warned of extreme pressure being placed on the officers it represents by the relaxation of rules. National chairman John Apter said: What we need from the Prime Minister and the Government now is clear and unambiguous messaging and guidance, explaining what exactly is expected of the public, so that my colleagues can do their level best to police it. While some of these changes also apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, it is for those governments to decide exactly how to proceed. Hereaposs what we know you can and canapost do in England.  things you can do from today . Exercise more than once per day From this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise, Boris Johnson previously announced. The rule that you could only take exercise once per day has been scrapped. The aposonce a dayapos rule was never laid down in the law, but it was in government guidance since March .  . Sit in the park or on a beach -  metres from others From today you will no longer have to keep moving all the time in parks and other public places . You will be allowed to sit and sunbathe, read a book or have a picnic, for example. The lawaposs wording means you can visit a public open space for the purposes of open-air recreation to promote your physical or mental health or emotional wellbeing. The condition is that you must be at least  metres from people outside your own household. The same rules that apply to parks will apply to beaches. That means you can sunbathe or read a book on a beach, just as you could in the park. Again, you may only do this with members of your own household. You must be at least  metres from all other households. Thereaposs an important exception to this - see point .  . Go to a garden centre Garden centres are, along with golf courses and tennis courts , reopening in England today. . Drive to other places foroutdoor activity Boris Johnson said in his speech that you can drive to other destinations from today. In England there is no limit on how far you can travel to an outdoor space - as long as you respect social distancing rules once youaposre there. You must ensure that you do not come within two metres of anybody who is not from your household, as this would risk you spreading the virus. You should not cross the border into Wales or Scotland, as they have dferent rules. But you can drive to the countryside for a walk, visit a quiet beach or go on a day-trip with members of your household. . Meet one friend or relative in the park -you stay two metres away from each other Government officials said that from today, you may sit with someone from another household in public under certain circumstances. Those areyou stay  metres apart - andthere are only two of you, one from each household. So for example, one person can meet another person from a separate household in a socially distanced way and chat from  metres away.

But you canapost bend the rule to have a very spread-out party in the park with your mates. . Play golf and tennis with members of your own household - or one person from another household Golf courses and tennis courts will be allowed to open from today in England. However, you would still have to play only with members of your own household. Or you can play with one person from another household, as long as you stay two metres apart. Basketball courts will also be allowed to reopen, again with the same social distancing rules. Other sports may be allowed but there is no word on football - which obviously cannot be carried out in a socially distanced way, and usually needs more people than are in the average household. . Go angling and swim in lakes and the sea Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England today. Again, you must be within your own household and  metres from other households. You can also swim in lakes and the sea as long as you’re socially distant - but not outdoor swimming pools. Or indoor swimming pools, which like gyms remain closed for the foreseeable. . Go back to work -you canapost work from home This is more a should do than a can do. Boris Johnson announced a change in emphasis - rather than strictly a change in the rules - from this week for who should and shouldnapost be at work. He said: Anyone who can’t work from home, for instance those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. Work from homeyou can, but you should go to workyou can’t work from home. He prompted outrage after saying the change was this week only to belatedly confirm he meant Wednesday. There is new guidance for firms to make workplaces safe, and unions are urging workers not tounless their workplace complies. . See a personal trainer in the park A personal trainer can have a session in a park with one client, a No spokesman said. This is because youaposre allowed to see one person from another household in the park, as long as youaposre both two metres away and donapost bring anyone with you. . Help a vulnerable person Government guidance says: You can go out to care for or help a vulnerable person, or to provide other voluntary or charitable services, following the advice set out here. You should not do soyou have coronavirus symptoms, however mild. Wherever possible, you should stay at least two metres away from others, and wash your hands for at least  seconds .  . View a flat or home From today the government will make it legal to carry out viewings, house moves and trips to letting or estate agents. The exceptions have been made public as part of new laws loosening the coronavirus lockdown in England. The Health Protection Regulations  say people may leave the home to undertake any of the following activities in connection with the purchase, sale, letting or rental of a residential property.

Pooch Molly has developed such a special bond with owner Fliss she has been able to train her to find plastic bottles, ropes, spades, buckets, and toys. And the inseparable duo have become famous in Scarborough for their ongoing efforts cleaning up the coastline  days a year. Hailing her furry friend, Fliss, , said: I can’t take credit for her great work, she’s the best dog and it’s really just the way she is. She’s my best bud, we work together, live together, play together, she’s at my side literally all the time. If I spent this much time with a human we would have fallen out by now, but the bond between a dog and their owner just gets stronger over time.  She’s super chilled, always up for an adventure and has to say hello to every single person and dog she meets. Molly is just a brilliant dog, I often wonder how I got so lucky, she has a beautul, happy soul and has changed my le for the better. The funny thing is she still doesn’t know the dference between an empty discarded bottle and a bottle that is still full which has led to some interesting situations. She’ll sometimes come back to me with a full bottle and I’ll look across the beach and there’ll be a confused person wondering why this dog has just stolen their drink. Her intentions are good though, and she’s just trying to do the right thing. Thankfully no one ever gets angry because she’s so cute!  Fliss said Molly picks up so many pieces of litter every day, the items have started to take over her home and workplace. She explained: I could probably fill a wheelie bin every week or two with what we collect. At one point my garage was probably % filled with beach litter waiting to be distributed to local artists for use in artwork sculptures etc. I also save any buckets spades beach toys that can be reused, and let tourists borrow them for the day - so my shop also has a couple of hundred of these which takes up quite a bit of space. Fliss has shared her inspiring story as part of IAMSapos latest campaign celebrating the magic of pets and the iniduality of each animal. She said Molly loves tucking into her breakfast bowl before a busy day doing her extra special job for the community.  Itaposs so important to give dogs a healthy, nutritious and balanced diet, which will keep them going all day! she told us. Molly needs it when sheaposs up and down the beach - the exercise is great for her as well.  IAMS champion the joy of your pet’s healthy vitality. Itaposs not simply visible health or your dog’s happiness it is a powerful combination of the two together. And that’s why IAMS want to help the nation’s pets live healthy, active and happy lives through the expert nutrition they truly enjoy. No compromise. Fliss moved to the seaside in  where she opened a bath and skincare shop - but she couldn’t believe how much litter she found left senselessly on the beach and said she was shocked and appalled by the “unavoidable” amount of litter she found while taking Molly for walks She added: Mollyaposs such a good girl and she’s never had any issues unless she spots a tennis ball - tennis balls take precedence over everything.

Of the first eight children, aged four to , who were treated - seven required the use of a ventilator. The -year-old later tested positive for coronavirus. The “cluster” of cases was detected in south east London - focused in the Woolwich and Southwark areas of the capital. Parents have been urged to not delay in seeking medical helptheir child is unwell. Doctors who uncovered the disease at Evelina London Children’s Hospital say it is similar to Kawasaki disease - a rare inflammatory disease which mainly affects children under the age of five. It can cause high temperatures, swelling and a red rash, and requires immediate hospital treatment. Hospitals nationwide have been alerted to what experts describe as a “new phenomenon” linked to coronavirus. Dr Sara Hanna, the Evelina’s medical director said: “We probably saw the first case in the middle of March.  “We had a child admitted with something very like Kawasaki – a bit like something we call toxic shock syndrome. “In the last two weeks, we have just seen this cluster of children where some of them look very like Kawasaki. “They have a high persistent fever, they have got red eyes, they have got a rash, they have got swollen hands and feet.” Doctors said blood tests were not testing positive for the virus in children, but other indicators were “remarkably similar” to those seen in adults with Covid-. Antibodies indicating recovery from Covid- were later found in about half the children. And Dr Hanna described the timing of the outbreak of the disease as “suspicious”.

Itaposs then Princess Anneaposs turn, who says thank you all so much, followed by Sophie Wessex who adds: Thank you for what youaposre doing.  It then cuts to Kate and Sophie, who teamed up for a joint project for the first time since the pandemic started to chat to nurses in several Commonwealth countries. Sophie, who is married to the Queenaposs youngest son Prince Edward, is often dubbed the Royal Familyaposs apossecret weaponapos and is said to get on famously with Kate. The two royal women can be heard thanking nurses for their hard work, and praising their commitment to treating people.  Kate says: Itaposs amazing that youaposre able to still continue the support and the care you would normally provide even under these really dficult circumstances. Sophie is also a seasoned campaigner, raising the profile of several projects during the crisis and used her role as Global Ambassador for the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness to talk to nurses from two hospitals in India yesterday.  Sophie, , who is also Colonel-in-Chief of the Queen Alexandra’s Royal Army Nursing Corps, subsequently talked to and introduced nurses from the Corps in Cyprus to Kate during the video calls. In , in her role as Patron of the Evelina London Children’s Hospital, Kate introduced Sophie to nurses from the hospital in the capital. Both women also talked to nurses from Gidgee Healing, Queensland, Australia and nurses from Phalombe District Hospital, Malawi, the Aberdeen Women’s Centre, Freetown, Sierra Leone and Sandilands Rehabilitation Centre, Nassau, the Bahamas. Princess Anne also passed her thanks to a nurse in Tanzania, saying: Thank you to you for being such a great leader out there. You understand the islands and what they need. Itaposs a pleasure to talk to you and I think we can be part of the celebration. Thank you so much. The new project comes after the Queen asked members of her family to step up while she is self-isolating due to the deadly virus, with senior aides setting up a programme dubbed the Royal Task Force aimed at extending The Firm’s public presence.

Scientists at University College Londonestimate there could be anything between , and , excess deaths within a year due to the Covid- pandemic, but that depends on how restrictions are lted. They built a risk calculator taking things such as age, sex and underlying illnesses into account. The data takes into account the risks of the infection as well as indirect effects such as strain on the health service. Author Professor Harry Hemmingway said keeping the infection rate down among the public is helping to keep vulnerable people safe. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  So far, lockdown measures have pushed the aposRapos rate of the illness - the rate of transmission - below one.He explained doctors also need to continue to deliver high quality medical care to vulnerable people to prevent excess deaths in those who are not infected with coronavirus .The study, published in The Lancet journal, looked at data from . million health records and based its conclusions on England having a % infection rate and % of people having a high-risk condition.  Lead author Dr Amitava Banerjee explained: For example, we show how a -year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has a % risk of dying over the next year and there are , apospatients like meaposin England. The calculator estimates  excess Covid-related deaths on top of the expected , deaths over a year in patients in a similar situation. He added: Our findings show the mortality risk for these vulnerable groups increases signicantly and could lead to thousands of avoidable deaths.

The distressing moment, which took place on Blackwell Trail in Derbyshire, saw the man become verbally abusive. The girlaposs mum, Michelle Prost, says her daughter was left traumatised by the incident, which she shared on social media yesterday. As the clip begins, Michelleaposs daughter can be seen riding her bike along the trail. She begins to approach the couple who are walking their dog and a manaposs voice shouts: Excuse me. The little girl begins ringing her bell as she approaches the dog walkers who make no attempt to move.  As she gets closer they still do not allow her space, and she begins wobbling. She tries to squeeze through but as neither adult allows her past she becomes sandwiched between them before toppling off her bike. The man shouts angrily I said excuse me several times as the young girl lies sprawled on the floor. The adults then begin having a heated discussion with the man explaining the girl is only six years old.  The little girl then bursts into tears, wailing Daddy as the couple walk away. Just as he is about to leave, the man is seen aggressively kicking the little girlaposs bike before walking away. An outraged Michelle took to social media to expose the manaposs behaviour. She posted the video with the caption: So this couple purposely ignore my  year old daughter ringing her bell and saying excuse me.  She starts screaming and wobbling in panic. The man turns and looks at my daughter, then the couple look at each other but continue to ignore her on purpose. She then rides into them in panic.

A friend told the Daily Mail the Duchess of Sussex believes Finding Freedom, due to come out in August, will finally set the record straight on their aposabdicationapos to North America.The source said Meghan is desperate to show the world why they were left with no other choice than to leave senior royal le in March. They added the former Suits actress also hopes the biography will shatter this image of [her] being a demanding a, revealing the monumental anguish and turmoil she has endured. I think [Meghan] wants people to feel sorry for her, or at least have compassion for her and all sheaposs been through, which has been anything but a fairy tale.  The new book promises the truth behind a couple who are not afraid to break tradition.The Sussexes are understood to have worked closely with authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, with the book set to reveal unknown details.  According to the promotional blurb, it will also be dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple in Britain and North America. Mr Scobie is the royal editor-at-large for Harperaposs Bazaar, while Ms Durand is a royal contributor for ELLE and OprahMag, with their book said to have been written with the participation of those closest to the couple. The Mail previously reported palace insiders believe the new publication will paint the couple in a flattering light and become something of a score-settling exercise.

Siblings Arlo and Arabella Devonport, three and two, were missing their pal Leo Adlington, three, who lives next door. Their mum Amy Vickers, , came up with the idea of making a hole on their communal fence, between their gardens in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. And after Leoaposs mum Becca agreed, they set to work, and now the three children can safely play together without touching. They can even draw pictures for each other and play noughts and crosses using wipeable markers. Amy, a support worker, who lives with partner Danny, , said: Arlo and Arabella have been finding it hard not seeing anyone during lockdown. It got to the point where they were climbing on top of the rabbit cage that we have next to the fence so they could see over it into the neighbouraposs garden which is clearly dangerous.  Instead of them climbing up, we decided to make them a little window so they would be able to stand there and see their friend next door.We measured the fence and then ordered a perspex  on eBay, cut into the fence  with a circular saw and drilled some holes in each corner so we could screw some screws into it to hold it in place. At least now the children can see each other and chat through the window.

Restaurants and bars could reopen in July under the governmentaposs plans to slowly lt restrictions. But that would depend on customers maintaining social distance measures. And one expert has suggested that pubs in rural areas could use local farmlands to expand, allowing people to drink while staying away from other groups.Tourism Alliance Director Kurt Janson told The Sun : Pubs could open back onto fields, especially in rural areas, and use farmeraposs fields to increase the footfall.If youaposre operating a country pub with a large beer garden, there must be ways to open them, such as a hatch opening to serve a garden bar. Or you could change planning rules to shut down streets in the evenings. The method would follow Sweden, where cafes and restaurants use streets to allow people to remain socially distant. Dublin and is also said to be considering using pedestrianised streets to allow businesses to reopen. It comes as hospitality bosses warn that around , pubs may never open again following the crisis. They also expressed dismay at being first in and last out of lockdown. Others have called for more clarity on how the Government plans to ease restrictions - and acknowledged that it could take up to  weeks before even a partial awakening of the sector. The British Beer  Pub Associationhas warned that up  per cent of Britainaposs pubs cannot survive beyond September with the current level of financial support being offered by the Government.  Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said despite looking for a glimmer of hope, the industry now faced further weeks of uncertainty. With insufficient clarity as to when pubs will reopen, our sector remains in limbo and facing severe uncertainty and financial devastation, she said. If Government plans to keep pubs closed until the final phase of release, as rumoured, this would make pubs first in and last out of lockdown.  Despite this, the Government hasnapost outlined any specic additional financial support for pubs to assure and help them through the extended lockdown hardship they face. We understand that pubs should only open when safe to do so, but extending the lockdown without offering additional support will be devastating. She added that the closure of so many social hubs would result in immeasurable damage to the wellbeing of our nation.

Belly Mujinga, , who had suffered long-term respiratory problems, died in hospital on April  –  days after the alleged assault at London’s Victoria Station. The mother-of-one and an unnamed colleague who was with her at the time were spat on, and both went on to contract Covid-. Their attacker, who has not been identied, allegedly told his victims that he had the virus. Although the other woman recovered, Belly’s condition deteriorated after she started to feel ill. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here She died just three days after being admitted to an intensive care ward and put on a ventilator. Her husband Lusamba, , and their daughter Ingrid, , never got to say goodbye. Ingrid had one last video call from her mum in her bed at Barnet Hospital before she became too sick to talk. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said today: It’s a tragic and appalling case, we specically strengthened the rules and the CPS published their own guidance to ensure people are protected from this sort of behaviour. Itaposs a really shocking incident and our thoughts are with the victim and their family.” Last night, Lusamba said Belly had asked for a back office job when the threat of Covid- became apparent in early March. But he alleges that her employer Thameslink, which runs services through the capital, insisted that she should continue dealing with customers face to face, before social-distancing rules had been installed. Lusamba, of Hendon, North London, said his we had made her bosses aware of her health issues following an operation three years ago. Belly was diagnosed with the lung condition sarcoidosis, which causes shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. “My daughter Ingrid just does not understand what has happened, how we can never be together again” the former warehouse worker said.  “It’s terrible to lose the person you love so quickly. “We are sure she got the virus from the man who spat on her, and it could have been so easily avoided. “He just shouted at them, ‘What are you doing here ’ and then spat over them deliberately. Belly was so upset and so scared.  “Our doctor had told us that she should keep away from people from three months because she was at risk. It was too dangerous, he told us. “After this happened he called the train company, but by then it was too late, she had already been infected.” Belly and Lusama came to Britain from the Democratic Republic of Congo as political refugees seeking refuge after facing persecution in their birth country. Both had worked hard to get a better le for themselves and their daughter. Belly was a member of the TSSA transport workers’ union, which has reported the alleged attack to the Railways Inspectorate, the safety arm of the Office for Road and Rail , for investigation. It believes the £, compensation which will be paid to relatives of health and care workers who die as a result of the pandemic should be extended to front-line transport staff too. General secretary Manuel Cortes said parent company GTR did not treat the assault seriously enough. “Sadly, Belly’s is just one of many family tragedies where children have had their parents taken away from them,” he said. “However, there are serious questions about her death, it wasn’t inevitable. “As a vulnerable person in the ‘at risk’ category and her condition known to her employer, there are questions about why GTR didn’t stand her down from front line duties early on in this pandemic.” Angie Doll, Managing Director of Southern Railway and Gatwick Express said: “We are devastated that our dedicated colleague Belly has passed away and our deepest sympathies are with her family with whom we have been in touch with through this very dficult time.

Islay McDevitt, from Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, had to spend the first  days of her le in hospital after she was born premature at just  weeks.Medics told her mum Tricia, , and dad Jamie, , were told she had a less than  per cent chance of survival, the Daily Record reports. The newborn had to endure several nerve-wracking surgeries and procedures, blood transfusions and a le-threatening battle with sepsis.But after defying the odds, on April , little Islay was showered with gts when she turned one. The nurses at the Queen Elizabeth said Islay was the smallest they had seen survive for a long time, her dad Jamie says. The statistics were horrible, but she defied the odds right from the get go.Her parents had hoped to take her to hospital to see the NHS medics who saved her le, but instead celebrated the milestone at home due to the coronavirus pandemic.It’s not the birthday party we had planned but you make the most of what you’ve got, Jamie continued. We had planned to take her back to the hospitals on her birthday so they could see how she has progressed but we obviously weren’t able to do that. As soon as this is over and done with we’ll have a lot of visiting to do. Before Islayaposs birth, her parents had been told at their -week scan that Tricia was in danger of going into labour at any time. After the scan we didn’t want to buy anything or plan because it was touch and go, Jamie adds. The medics said the  week mark was what we were trying to get to, because before that the babies are classed as non-viable. It was a horrible time. Tricia’s waters broke at  weeks and the mum was given steroid injections to prepare Islay’s tiny lungs for being born. When she arrived at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital she was so small that the couple were told the first few days were critical. Jamie said: It takes your breath away to see this wee le, so small, that is fighting so hard. When she was born she pulled the breathing tube out and started crying. But it showed us straight away she had a bit of fight about her. The day after she was born, Jamie was able to lt Islay in her incubator for the first time so staff could change her sheets. And at five days old she was able to have her first skin-to-skin contact with her mum. The coming weeks would bring a series of challenges, including a devastating diagnosis of sepsis at six weeks old and traumatic eye surgery. But at more than two months old, the youngster began to show positive development. Jamie said: At  weeks we were told to go back to the Royal and she settled in straight away and flourished. We had our wee support network with the other parents and the staff at both hospitals were unbelievable. They’re just a dferent breed. To thank the NHS staff who saved Islayaposs le, Jamie is now planning to run the -mile West Highland Way in just  hours this summer. All money raised will go to the neonatal units at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital and Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where Islay was treated. The dad has already raised more than £, and has even been given training tips by Mark Beaumont - who broke a world record for cycling around the globe - after his nurse sister put the pair in touch.

In the guidance to parents the question: What happensthere is a confirmed case of coronavirus in my childaposs school, college or childcare setting , is posed and answered. The Government response reads: When a child, young person or staff member develops symptoms compatible with coronavirus, they should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for  days. Their fellow household members should self-isolate for  days. All staff and students who are attending an education or childcare setting will have access to a testthey display symptoms of coronavirus. It goes on: Where the child, young person or staff member tests positive, the rest of their class group within their childcare or education setting should be sent home and advised to self-isolate for  days. The other household members of that wider class group do not need to self-isolate unless the child, young person or staff member they live with in that group subsequently develops symptoms.  It also adds that a rapid investigation will be launcheda child tests positive and a whole school could be shut down. The guidance says: As part of the national test and trace programme,other cases are detected within the child or young person’s cohort or in the wider education or childcare setting, Public Health England’s local Health Protection Teams will conduct a rapid investigation and will advise schools and other settings on the most appropriate action to take. In some cases, a larger number of other children and young people may be asked to self-isolate at home as a precautionary measure - perhaps the whole class, site or year group.

Brown, of Llangefi, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Elen Owen, defending, said Brown was trying to stand up for herself when the attack happened but went too far.

Michele German, , has previously told of her “obsession” with John Lotter, saying she would marry him “in a heartbeat”. She first knew of Lotter when she was  after he was sentenced. Since then the grandmother of four closely followed his case and eventually wrote him a letter three years ago. Convinced of his innocence she runs Lotter’s Facebook page from her home in West Lothian, Scotland, from where she regularly exchanges letters, emails and phone calls with the killer. And she is even asking strangers to crowdfund a flight to Nebraska so she can meet him for the first time. But the mum of victim Brandon Teena says the “deluded” former carer is a “crazy b****” who has been “sucked in” by Lotter . “I hope she’s never allowed to step foot in America,” JoAnn Brandon, , said from her home in Nebraska. Insisting Lotter “should be dead by now” she added: “He beat, raped and murdered my child. “He took a gun to his head and executed him at a point-blank range. His accomplice then stabbed him through the liver. They also murdered Lisa Lambert and Philip DeVine.” In a direct message to Ms German she said: “Close your eyes for one second, Michele, picture the man you say you’d marry in a heartbeat, stopping the heartbeat of three innocent people in cold blood.  “Do you never stop to imaginethis was your child who’d been raped and murdered what you would think  “The man whose eyes you look into when saying ‘I do’ will be the same eyes I hope one day will be looking back at his victims’ families when justice is finally served.” Brandon Teena’s murder in  inspired the film Boys Don’t Cry, which earned Hilary Swank an Oscar for her portrayal of him. Born female and christened Teena, he posed as a man, adopting the name Brandon Teena, and dated several women, including Lotter’s ex, Lana Tisdel. But after an arrest for forging cheques he was placed in the local women’s prison. News of the crime made the local paper, outing Brandon Teena as transgender to locals, which enraged serial con Lotter and his friend, arsonist Tom Nissen.  At a Christmas Eve party, they forced Brandon Teena to remove his trousers, in a sick attempt to prove to Tisdel he was born female. Lotter and Nissen later forced him into a car and drove to an area by a meat-packing plant, where they attacked and raped him. After finding out the -year-old reported the attack to police, Lotter and Nissen tracked him down to a remote farmhouse on New Year’s Eve . On breaking in, they found Brandon Teena hiding under a blanket at the foot of pal Lambert’s bed.

A notice says each officials should submit plans to carry out tests on all residents of the city, which has a population of  million. Each district should make plans and arrangements to conduct nucleic acid tests on the entire population in its jurisdiction within a -day time limit, the notice said. It comes after a cluster of new cases in the crisis-hit city were reported. Wuhan was the epicentre of the deadly outbreak which has killed thousands  and infected more than million people globally. One of the new  cases was the we of an -year-old male patient reported a day earlier in the first confirmed case in the city in more than a month. At present, the task of epidemic prevention and control in the city is still very heavy, said the Wuhan health authority in a statement. We must resolutely contain the risk of a rebound.  The new infections sounded a note of caution amid efforts to ease coronavirus-related restrictions across China as businesses restart and iniduals go back to work. Authorities in one affected region said it was now in aposwar-timeapos mode as they battle to stop the spread of asymptomatic cases and a second spike of the disease. All of the latest confirmed cases were previously classied as asymptomatic, people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs such as a fever. The number of asymptomatic cases in China is not known, as they only appear on the radar of health officials when they show up positive during tests conducted as part of contact tracing and health checks. China does not include asymptomatic cases in its overall tally of confirmed cases, currently at ,, until they exhibit signs of infection. Mainland China has reported , deaths. Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released on April  from a months-long lockdown, are currently being monitored, according to the cityaposs health authority.  The number of new cases reported in China since April have been small compared with the thousands confirmed each day in February, thanks to a nationwide regime of screening, testing and quarantine. The government said on Friday that China will gradually reopen cinemas, museums and other recreational venues, though restrictions including mandatory reservations and a limit on numbers will be in place.

Cases have arisen in one of the worst hit countries in Europe that suggests survivors face a new battle with health issues such as fatigue and breathing problems. Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by Covid- cases with its healthcare system struggling to cope with the influx of cases and its large elderly population particularly affected.It is now ahead of the UK, Spain, France and the US, with discovering the long-term effects suffered by those who beat the virus, New York Times reports. Morena Colombi from Truccazzano, outside the northern city of Milan, was deemed coronavirus free after a six-week fight with the virus after she tested negative on March . But weeks later she says she is nowhere near to being recovered as she is struggling with a cough, crippling fatigue, aching muscles and a shortness of breath. The aftermath of the virus means the -year-old, who has ed to her job with a cosmetics company, is unable to even take a short walk. She said: “I can’t get back into my natural rhythms.” Many Italians have learnt that the infection can hang on for weeks, the symptoms can linger for weeks more, and full recovery can take longer still —ever. An estimated , people tested positive for coronavirus in Italy with , dying - the second highest number in Europe with the UK hitting the top spot.  An estimated , people in Italy recovered but such is the stubbornness of coronavirus and the long recovery time that some survivors and not only facing physical uncertainty but their are grappling with financial woes too. Alessandro Venturi, the director of the San Matteo hospital in the Lombardy town of Pavia, said they have seen many cases where survivors face a long road to recovery. This includes those who suffered lighter symptoms as their bodies struggle toto normal as they struggle with post-symptoms including aching bones and an upset stomach.  He said: “It’s not the sickness that lasts for  days, it is the convalescence. Itaposs already well known that some people who contract Covid- can be asymptomatic, so they have few symptoms or none, while others become gravelly ill often with pneumonia. However pneumonia damages the lungs, which can take months to heal, and doctors warn it may not be completely reversible. Studies also claims the virus can cause kidney, heart, liver and neurological damage, often from secondary infections - it is unknown what the long term future is for sufferers.  Martina Sorlini, a -year-old math and physics high school teacher has suffered a fever since the beginning of March which she says aposnever finishesapos.She also has to contend with a cough, sore throat, stomach aches and fatigues which makes it dficult for her to teach students online.Dr Annalisa Malara, an intensive care physician in Codogno, southeast of Milan, who diagnosed Italy’s first case in February, said there was still no clear understanding of why the virus and its effects last such a long time. Some say more research should be done to determine why. In north Italy, the epicentre of the contagion in the nation, a partial lting of the lockdown this month has allowed more family and friends to compare their dferent experiences.  Edmondo Cirielli, a MP for right-wing Brotherhood of Italy party, ran a fever and suffered cold-like symptoms in March. He tested positive and believes he contracted it by touching an infected surface in the Parliament chamber. He thought he would be fine but ended up in hospital with breathing dficulties but as it wasnapost pneumonia he was discharged and went home to self-quarantine. Exercise Unlimited exercise outdoors is to be allowed, with the previous aposonce-a-dayapos rule scrapped Sunbathing People will be allowed to sit on parks and beaches, provided they stay two metres away from other people Drive Boris Johnson said in his speech on Sunday night that people will be able to drive to other destinations from Wednesday, presumably to exercise there, although more detailed plans are likely to follow Meet others From May , people will be able to meet one friend or relative from a dferent household in a public place, provided they stay two metres apart. Gatherings of more than two people remain banned, so people cannot meet both their parents, for example Play golf and tennis Golf courses and tennis courts will reopen from May , with social distancing relatively easy to achieve, although you can play only with people in your household. Team sports such as football are not likely to be encouraged, as social distancing is dficult and more people than the average household would be required Fishing and swimming Angling and water sports are also to be allowed to resume in England from Wednesday. Again, you must be within your own household and two metres from other people Return to work Rather than a change to the rules, the government is now encouraging people toto workthey cannot do so from home. But they also urge people to drive, walk or cycle to work rather than use public transport,possible After  days of suffering debilitating fatigue, sore throat, diarrhoea and intense pain at the base of his neck that made it impossible to concentrate he tested negative so thought it was over. But he continued to suffer from diarrhoea and went on to test positive which forced him back into isolation. He said: “One day I was fine, the next bad. There was no building to a peak and then coming back down. It was up and down for a month.Not everyone has access to testing, which has been imperfect, including -year-old Ingrid Magni who said she suffered three weeks of intense headaches."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53713531-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53713531-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53713531-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.53713531-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"calum woodger dundee united dundee fc scottish cup","story":"They sayyou want to move forward, don’t look back but a quick glance at the not-so-distant past could provide inspiration for our city clubs.This week marks six years since Dundee’s  Championship title win, with Friday coming the th anniversary of Dundee United’s second-ever Scottish Cup success.Both triumphs predate my time in the city as a football writer but it just goes to show it’s not always been doom and gloom around these parts!Paul Hartley’s Dee side and Peter Houston’s  vintage show the winning-potential both James McPake and Robbie Neilson will be aspiring to achieve at each end of Tannadice Street.It may not be the glorious s for the Dark Blues or the halcyon days of the s for United anymore but there are signs both are getting back on track.For United, four years of toiling in the Championship is now over as the good times threaten toand, despite relegation last year, Dundee will move into the new campaign with optimism things will be dferent in the future.Robbie has already got a little taste for it with the league title but ambitious targets for next term are not beyond their reach.It will be a slow build-up to making the top six, getting the club back in Europe and, potentially, challenging for silverware but the club are now better-placed to do just that.The culmination of Houstie hoisting the cup aloft at Hampden a decade ago wasn’t achieved overnight.There were years of work from Houston, as No , and Craig Levein to get their hands on silverware.Not only that, top-four spots were achieved three seasons on the spin, meaning European football was back at Tannadice on a consistent basis for the first time since the s.Their legacy with the supporters remains for Levein and Houston, and, make no mistake, Robbie will want his own piece of Arab admiration.For Dundee, next season they could be the top dogs in the Championship once more, depending on whether Hearts do in fact drop down.The  side’s instant bounce-back from relegation should give hope to a Dark Blues side starting to look over the PTSD of the   campaign.McIntyre’s misfits are gone and McPake’s ways are starting to bear fruit.Our clubs can’t afford to linger on the past but, while we take a pause for breath, it is quite OK to dream.Following the breakdown of league reconstruction talks the next step seems to be inevitable.The SPFL will now, surely, move to enact the mandate given to it by the lower leagues’ vote to end the season and call the Premiership, too.From a public health standpoint, amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis, I don’t think many would disagree with that logic.However, the caveat of the failed league talks will mean it rankles with many.And rightly so.That the league couldn’t come up with a solution to save Hearts from relegation, promote the likes of Inverness and Falkirk, or leave any club worse off for that matter, is hugely disappointing and feels wholly unfair.It will likely, as always, have come down to money and self-interest.The former is important, clubs need to have financial security in these uncertain times.But pressing ahead with the same --- structure for next season at least is not for the greater good of the game.One step forward, two back.I don’t know about anyone  but I’m getting sick of the sideshow that is Rangers’ SPFL ‘dossier’.Of course, it suits the Ibrox power-brokers to create an us-against-them narrative but it is the last thing the rest of the league needs amid the coronavirus crisis.Whether SPFL bullying is proven or not, self-interest must be set aside for a far more pressing matter.We must face up to the fact clubs are fighting for their lives.It was a pleasure to have Ronny Costello and Paul McNicoll from The Dode Fox Podcast on Twa Teams, One Street this week to review Dundee United’s season.

I hope in the near future we see Dundee in the Premiership.”Despite having played under notable managers such as Dino Zoff, Nils Liedholm, Sven Goran-Eriksson, Cesare Maldini and Giovanni Trapattoni, the Bonetti brothers came to Dundee with very little managerial experience.A short time at amateur side Sestrese in Genoa with Dario in charge and Ivano player-assistant apart, this was the Italians’ first venture into top-flight management.“Dundee have taken a major gamble in choosing the potential of the Bonettis over the proven track record of Jocky Scott,” admitted chairman Jimmy Marr at the time.The Bonettis, though, were supremely confident their vast network of contacts built up over stellar playing careers would enable Dundee to marry international talent with home-grown players.“Dundee had great potential,” said Dario.“There were a lot of fans and they were extraordinary fans – it was one of the best places possible to build a great team.“The club had a very important football history and the people wanted to see good football.“I thought Dundee could go on to win the Scottish league but it needed the technical program to become international and to become competitive.“Around Europe, Dundee had a great opportunity to buy important players. We wanted to bring young players on free transfers, they help the club win something, and then sell on to bring the club money.“For this you did not just need money but it is important to have the idea and you needed the contacts to build a great team.”The Bonetti era began on the pitch on July , , at Motherwell.Predictably there was a Continental feel to the scoreline with goals from Patrizio Billio and Javier Artero in a - win.Those two may have been inherited from the previous season but the starting XI that day saw six new faces – Marco de Marchi, Marcello Marrocco, Georgi Nemsadze, Ivano himself, Fabian Caballero and Juan Sara all brought in over the summer.New faces would be a regular occurrence throughout their time at the club with no fewer than  foreign players making their Dundee debuts under the Bonettis.Georgian international Nemsadze would quickly play his way into Dundee hearts in the middle of the park while Argentines Caballero and Sara leading the line promised plenty.In the autumn, a serious knee injury to marksman Caballero in a - derby win at Dens prompted an audacious attempt to bring Argentina icon Claudio Caniggia in as replacement.That ambition paid off as the superstar, a former team-mate of Dario’s, arrived on October  and immediately set about enshrining adulation among the Dens support with five goals in his first six matches.Regularly among the imported names, however, were Rab Douglas, Barry Smith, Gavin Rae, Steven Tweed, Chris Coyne and Willie Falconer.And it didn’t take long for the local boys to impress their new Italian coaches.“We wanted to build a team and it was important that the Scottish players were the soul of the team,” added Dario.“We had players like Gavin Rae, Barry Smith, Rab Douglas. We wanted a good mix of Scottish and foreign players because the Scottish guys could show the new players the mentality needed to play at Dundee.“Rae went to play for the national team and we had a very good player in captain Barry Smith.“It did not surprise me to see players like this because we knew there would be talent. They had great mentality and good technique.“All players dream to play in Scotland because the football is so important for everybody, not just fans, and we knew what could be possible there.“In the first season, the objective was to arrive in the top six and continue to progress. It was not easy because the Scottish top ision was very competitive and we played against very important teams with great history.“We got a good result but we needed more good players.”That first campaign would bring that top-six finish and included famous wins at both Parkhead and Ibrox but among the great results and, at times, champagne football, were disappointments.Inconsistency was a regular feature in the first season and the Bonettis were desperate to build on the good aspects the following campaign.They would have to do it without Caniggia, however, as he headed for Rangers chasing a place at the  World Cup. An £, fee for a -year-old they had picked up on a free transfer less than a year earlier, though, gave credence to the Bonetti plan to buy cheap and sell big.That cash prompted permanent deals for Argentines Caballero, Sara and Beto Carranza as well as a new three-year deal for Nemsadze.The second season would also herald the arrival of another Dens favourite in Argentine goalie Julian Speroni along with Chinese captain Fan Zhiyi from Crystal Palace and Georgian playmaker Temuri Ketsbaia from Wolves.An early start – just four weeks after the - season ended # in the Inter-Toto Cup got the campaign off on the wrong foot with a - reverse to FK Sartid in Serbia and, with it, accusations of match-fixing from boss Ivano.Once more flashes of brilliance throughout the campaign didn’t materialise into steady results and the Dark Blues ended up in ninth place, just four points above second-bottom ’Well.“In the second year we had a problem with the Inter-Toto Cup where we started very early,” said Dario.“We played a good season, not as good as the first one, but maybe the supporters at that moment thought there was a possibility to be better.“The second season there were more problems that were not there in the first campaign when everybody was concentrated with us at the start.”Two years into their three-year deal, the Bonettis’ reign would end where it started, at Fir Park on May , .This time it was a - defeat with penalties awarded for both sides, Caballero netting for the Dee, which sparked a stunning attack on referee Willie Young from Ivano after the match, calling the whistler “dishonest” and having “a party through the night when Dundee lose”.However, it wasn’t until pre-season training for - started that the Italian revolution was declared over by chief executive Peter Marr on July .Dario rued: “I liked being at the club and hoped to stay longer.

It was our dream to bring Dundee to the top, not just the top six but win the league.“We were disappointed not to finish our project because we loved Dundee and all the people at the club but it did not happen.”The plan to buy in talent and sell it on at a profit failed and the club was plunged into administration the following year with debts of £ million.Bonetti said: “Yes, we were very sad to see the club go to administration after we left.“But we bought Speroni for nothing and the club got money, we brought Caniggia for nothing and the club got money.“We are sad the club had problems after we left but Dundee was a good period for us, we have such wonderful memories.“Those two years were a very happy time for us in the city.

I think that’s why they took to him right away.“I am delighted for him, he’s still very fit and he’ll be looking to add to the games he has played for this football club.“I know he still believes there is a lot more football in Paul McGowan and I think he’s had another excellent season.”The duo arrived at Dens as players in the summer of  and became fast friends, driving up to Dundee from Glasgow every day.Now McGowan’s boss, McPake admits their relationship has changed somewhat from the days when he’d be on the receiving end of a regular verbal volley on the park.“If there were three people around him then he would still take the ball,” McPake added.“That’s brave –people talk about centre-backs being brave because they’ll put their head where it hurts but Paul McGowan is brave because he’ll take the ball in tight spaces and work something.“He very rarely loses the ball, gets you fouls and there is a respect from other teams to him. I’ve found that as a manager, the amount of times I heard ‘McGowan’s a good player’ from other managers last season.“He was great to play with, he would always take it – he could be a pain when you didn’t give him it and the game is going on up the pitch but he’s still standing trying to argue with you!“That’s Gowser. But there’s more than a screamer or a shouter – he encourages people, he helps people out and he’s honest. He’s the first to put his hand up when he believes he’s done something wrong and that’s gone in the modern game. He sets such high standards.“He’s a voice in the dressing-room as well. I’ve played with him but it’s a completely dferent relationship now.#I was his team-mate and his mate but now we don’t see much of each other apart from on the training ground. The dynamics have changed but I know exactly what I’ll get from him whenever he’s on the pitch.“There have been a few times when I’ve thought ‘I’m glad I’ve got Paul McGowan’. Evenhe’s not played you might think there will be a problem, not playing against United or Aberdeen, but he just accepts it and goes and trains.“There’s no sulking and is great to work with. He was great to play with because he’s such a quality footballer and I’m glad I have him at my disposal as a manager. He’s a leader for our club.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/Richie-McMurchie-Mulligans-Bar-391x564.jpg ","title":"dundee key worker balancing daytime job with booking entertainment for virtual pub","story":"A train station worker has been making sure a virtual pub#s entertainment doesn#t go off the rails.Richie McMurchie, from Charleston, has become a regular face at #Mulligan#s Virtual Bar# on Facebook along with almost , others from around the world.The -year-old had initially joined as a punter before being snapped up by pub landlord, Pat Mulligan, to work on managing the entertainment.Richie, who works for ScotRail as an announcer, has been balancing his day-to-day duties of keeping the s running while making sure those inside Mulligan#s are enjoying themselves.As well as taking on administrative duties within the bar he has been enjoying seeing an array of talent from around the world who have stepped onto the Mulligan#s stage.Richie said: #I had followed the Mulligan#s Virtual Bar page since it launched.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

There#s a responsibility on all of us to be clear in our messaging and the applicability of that messaging.#She said it was dficultdecisions were being taken which, even #inadvertently# were presented as #UK wide when they are not#.Meanwhile, the Scottish Government has decided to drop the #once-a-day# exercise restriction."},{"url":null,"title":"the news you can trust","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSUMMARYThere are so many sources of news and information about coronavirus, but which ones should you trust to help you stay safe, protect the NHS and save lives Coronavirus fraud and misinformation are barriers to the nation continuing the progress it has made toward coming to terms with, and beating, the virus"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday to you","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your wee oneenjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them Happy Birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where you are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiserHere are the lockdown birthdays from our May  edition."},{"url":null,"title":"pedal powered loans to key workers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Ardrishaig Bothy is helping key workers and other residents get around # using pedal power.The Bothy has loaned out its fleet of  electric bicycles and six traditional cycles to help people commute to work, take their daily exercise and undertake other essential tasks.The Bothy, a collaboration between Cycling UK and Scottish Canals, works with organisations to encourage more people to walk and cycle in the area.

When social distancing guidelines are relaxed we look forward to launching our e-bike library, but in the meantime we can’t think of a better use for the bikes.#Cycling journeys in Scotland have shot up during lockdown, with recent figures released by Transport Scotland showing a  per cent increase compared to typical levels.Cycling UK is also providing free essential cycling services and repairs for key workers through the Big Bike Revival for key workers scheme.The charity is working with more than  independent bike shops, recycling centres and mechanics workshops in Scotland – including Fyne Bike Cycle Repair in Ardrishaig.

The residential units are shown to be laid out in such a way that adheres to the normally accepted privacy and amenity criteria on overlooking and overshadowing, whilst affording the future occupants of the residential units an appropriate level of privacy and residential amenity.Access to the new development would come from Fall Avenue and James Kirk Way.A design and access statement included within the planning application notes meetings had taken place with ious local authority departments in a bid to address ious design requirements.It concludes: ldquoOverall, it is considered that the final design creates a well-considered, proportionate design that responds to the site constraints and the nearby area to create a positive design solution.ldquoThe result is a development that will make a positive contribution socially, economically and aesthetically to the area and enhance the amenity of existing and future residents within this area.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council stressed they ldquowelcomed comments from community councils.She said: ldquoIn this case, we consulted the community council back in December, and they submitted a response detailing a number of concerns.ldquoThese included concerns over house type and layout, increased vehicle movement and parking space provision.ldquoWhilst we understand that consultees may be frustrated when planning authorities do not always agree with their comments, we must balance these comments against the other material considerations of each case.ldquoIn the case of the Hallhill application, our conclusion was that, subject to the imposition of conditions, the proposed development was acceptable.Thank you for reading this story.

The trees, according to the design and access statement, cause a number of issues, including not letting light into the building, while their removal would also prevent damage to its foundations caused by the roots.Access to the clubhouse would also be improved through the resurfacing of a footpath, while a new lamppost would be erected to further improve the lighting.Thank you for reading this story.

This year the figure fell to less than  per cent.The council also refuses to allow children whose parents opt to keep them home and fund the nursery place themselves to remain in school nurseries.Parents who decide to pay for an additional year of nursery themselves to keep their children out for a year face bills of up to pound, and a hunt for alternative child care places.Another mum who was refused funding said she had initially been supported in her view that her child was too immature to start school by her nursery.But they withdrew that support after pressure from the councilrsquos education department, she said.ldquoThey were told that they couldnrsquot support us because we didnrsquot meet the council policy criteria and withdrew their support, she explained.ldquoOur views meant nothing and the impact on our child meant nothing.And other parents expressed fears that their children were being robbed of nursery experience because they have been in lockdown for some of the vital months they would have had and would have no transition into school.One mum said: Children who start school at -years-old already receive a year less nursery time than those who are older, that has been reduced further by the closure of nurseries.ldquoHow can we ask these young children to go from months at home with their family to suddenly starting primary one with no transition A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoconfirmed they have now agreed to approve all deferral requests for the year ahead.They said: ldquoAs a result of the ongoing closure of schools and nurseries, we have been reviewing applications for deferred entry to P, ahead of session  .

which has supported seven million jobs at a cost of pound billion a month, until the end of July.After that, companies will be expected to make a contribution to the payments, although the amount workers take home will not fall below the  per cent mark.How much will businesses be expected to pay towards furlough The details will be published later this month, the Chancellor said, but it is

The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

The deep fried Mars bar cliche of Scots is tired and lazy.But I tell you what, theres been nothing like two months on house arrest to prompt me to remember the gym with a fondness I never felt when it was open and minutes from my flat. Mere weeks ago I would conjure up the flimsiest of excuses not to exercise.\"But my trainers... they take so long to lace up.\" And back to the couch Id go.Being told that outdoor exercise is no longer allowed, except in little doses, has been exactly what I needed to appreciate the glory of stretching my legs and working up a hard earned sweat and I cant imagine Im alone there.The First Ministers announcement that the lockdown rules will be slightly eased has led to daydreams about when and where and how I might wander twice per day.But lockdown has led to another interesting development. The discovery of online classes.To my absolute delight, Scottish Ballet announced it would move its specialist classes online. At .am every day a Facebook live class is held for a iety of dferent audiences: Dance for Parkinsonrsquos, Time to Dance for people living with dementia, and Elevate for people living with Multiple Sclerosis.A Thursday is Regenerate, for the over-s. Wonderfully, Ma Stewart has taken to the Regenerate class with gusto, though shed port de bras me in the face for telling you, and is having a wonderful time learning a new skill despite being isolated at home.I took ballet classes for more than  years and miss them dreadfully so was thrilled to learn that, on a Friday morning, one of my favourite Scottish Ballet dancers, Bethany Kingsley-Garner, was taking a class \"for all ages\".I made an excuse not to be showing up for the morning work Teams video conference and got my leggings on, dug out my old ballet shoes and was there, feet in first position, ready to go.It turned out that \"all ages\" more meant \"for parents and children\" but you know, I had a wonderful time pretending to be a swan and opening up to the sunshine like a spring flower.Its amazing what the body remembers, even after a long time sedentary. Despite it being a class for tots, I could feel my muscles readily moving back into the old, familiar patterns, my big toe drawing the swirl of a ron de jambe on the floor or arms lting into fth position.Its sad to discover my grand battement are more of an extremely pathetic battement but it seems my right hip is giving me gyp. Perhaps all the sitting, who knows.But a hobbling right hip led to the next new indoor exercise discovery. The near-cult like movement of Yoga By Adrienne. Yoga is another love that has fallen by the wayside as work and le took over.I was looking for some hip opener exercises to help ease the pain, seeking out a little something for my neck, stf from hunching over a laptop at my dining table.There she was - Adrienne Mishler. Apparently shes already an international yoga star with millions of devoted YouTube followers. Who knew  Well, as I say millions of people. And no wonder.Shes perfect in a pandemic. No overly dficult, Instagram focused headstands here. \"Try thisyou can,\" she tells me in a first video, \"Maybe youll manage it, maybe you never will.\"Thats the spirit.My yoga mat has become five feet of safe space, with the soothing sound of Adrienne guiding me into a downward dog.I was becoming accustomed to being physically unambitious but now these online tutorials have sparked me back into action.Im almost sad about being allowed back outdoors, away from the safety of the gentle online guidance of Bethany and Adrienne.Its perhaps ironic that one tiny positive is the rediscovery of long lost movement in a lockdown.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

People should avoid public transport unless they absolutely have to use it because it is safer when there is fewer people on it.\"He suggested more people should get on a bike to go to work.\"You say not everybody can cycle, thats true, but lots more people can than do and now is actually a good time to start cycling to work because there is hardly any traffic on the roads so its much more pleasant to cycle than in normal times,\" Mr Hancock said.A key worker has said that social distancing was \"impossible to maintain\" on his journey to work on the London Underground this morning.Terry McCarthy, , a supermarket store manager, took a photo at Canada Water at am and shared it to Twitter with the caption: \"And they try to tell us the tube is at % capacity! This is dangerous and putting lives at risk!\"He explained how his place of work was too far away to walk or cycle to.\"Both the  and the train were busier than what it has been the last few weeks. There were too many people in the carriage and social distancing was impossible to maintain,\" added Mr McCarthy.Transport operators in England are being urged to rearrange, remove or limit seating \"to try and ensure social distancing is observed\".This could include blocking off seats in close proximity to others and removing face-to-face seating.Single users of black cabs and minicabs are being advised to sit in the back left-hand seat of taxis.All transport operators have been issued guidance on ensuring stations and services are regularly cleaned.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, who will make a Commons statement on the guidance this afternoon, said: \"Transport operators and staff have been working hard to ensure that people who need to get to work are able to do so, including crucial NHS workers and all those on the front line of the fight against the virus.\"Alongside the cycling and walking revolution we are launching and clear guidance to passengers and operators published today, we can all play our part by following the advice and reducing pressure on public transport.\"If we take these steps, all those who need to use public transport should feel confident that they can do so safely with the space to maintain social distancing as far as possible,\" he added.Passengers south of the border are being advised to \"avoid using public transport where possible\" and should \"instead try to walk, cycle or drive\".People who do travel should be \"thinking carefully about the times, routes and ways you travel\".The guidance recommends:*keeping two metres apart from others wherever possible*wearing a face coveringyou can*using contactless payment where possible*avoiding rush hour travel where feasible*washing or sanitising your hands as soon as possible before and after travel and*following advice from staff and being considerate to others.The new advice follows the announcement of a pound billion package of cycling and walking investment for England that will deliver a ldquogreen revolution in travel, aiming to ease the pressure on public transport services by helping more people than ever choose alternative forms of travel.This includes pound million for local authorities in England to create pop-up bike lanes with protected space for cycling, wider pavements, safer junctions, and cycle and bus-only corridors.The overall expenditure will produce a knock-on windfall for the Scottish Government of around poundm via the Barnett Formula."},{"url":null,"title":"chancellor-rishi-sunak-extends-uk-govt-furlough-scheme-end-october-flexibility-part-time-work","story":"Responding to an Urgent Question asked by Labour in the House of Commons, the Chancellor explained that the Job Retention Scheme would run for another four months.Until the end of July, there would be no changes but from the start of August until the end of October the scheme would change to facilitate a sharing of the burden with employers of paying % of peoplersquos salaries, up to pound, a month.New statistics published today revealed the furlough scheme ndash described by Mr Sunak as a ldquoworld-leading economic intervention - had protected . million jobs and supported almost one million businesses.The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that extending the scheme in its current form for five months to the end of July would add an extra pound billion, bringing the total by then to around poundbn. The further three-month extension would push the overall cost higher.He said all sectors and regions of the UK would continue to be covered with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work.The Chancellor told MPs: \"Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. And we will ask employers to start sharing with the Government the cost of paying peoples salaries. Full details will follow by the end of May.\"But Mr Sunak, who turned  today, went on: ldquoI want to assure people today of one thing that wont change. Workers will through the combined efforts of Government and employers continue to receive the same level of overall support as they do now at % of their current salary up to pound, a month.\"Im extending the scheme because I wont give up on the people who rely on it. Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britains workers and businesses as we came into this crisis and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side.\"Later, when askedthe scheme could be extended beyond October, the Chancellor told the House that everything would be kept under review, noting: ldquoBut my expectation is by then the scheme should end. As I have said before we have stretched and strained to be as generous as possible to businesses and workers, which is why we have made the decision we have made today, which is important to me personally.ldquoBut, of course, as I have also said, this scheme is expensive. It is the right thing to do the cost of not acting would have been far higher.ldquoBut it is not something that can continue indefinitely into the future. Eight months of total support is a considerable amount of time and, now we have a plan from the Prime Minister with a path to reopening those parts of our economy that are closed, I believe we can get the country back on track, get people back into work and this scheme will help them to do it in a measured way, a phased way, and protect as many jobs as possible.Nicola Sturgeon gave the announcement a cautious welcome.Speaking at the Scottish Governmentrsquos daily briefing on Covid-, the First Minister said: ldquoAn extension to October is welcome. Hopefully, with the caveat that Irsquove not seen the detail yet, on the face of it that should avoid clf edges, where companies have to start redundancy processes because theyrsquore worried about the furlough scheme coming to an end within the timescale that they have to consult around redundancies.ldquoSo, it gives companies more time to do that and, hopefully, over that period we are going to see the further suppression of the virus and that, albeit gradual and perhaps relatively slow restart of the economy.She added: ldquoFrom what I have been able to gather so far, the Chancellorrsquos announcement is welcome but I will wait and see the detail before commenting any further on it.Jackson Carlaw, leader of the Scottish Conservatives said: ldquoWe all know that the Covid- pandemic represents a colossal economic threat as well as a public health crisis.ldquoThe Chancellor has today given millions of workers across Scotland economic security right through until October.ldquoIntroducing part-time flexibility into the scheme in July is something that businesses have been asking for and is very welcome.Mr Carlaw said the simplicity and clarity of the Chancellorrsquos message was striking.ldquoThis crisis is not over, there is still a long road ahead, but Scottish employees and employers have been given an enormous safety net, he added.In the Commons, Anneliese Dodds for Labour said many were taken aback by comments attributed to Government officials suggesting people need to be \"weaned off an addiction\" to the furlough scheme.The Shadow Chancellor said she had only heard about the Governmentrsquos changes \"in the last few seconds\" and will examine them \"very, very carefully\".Ms Dodds said people do not want to be furloughed, adding in the Commons: \"Its critically important they are not penalised for that choice. We welcome the flexibility mentioned, weve asked for this repeatedly.\"Mr Sunak replied: \"The use of the word addiction is not one I have ever used and not one I agree with.\"Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme. People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, its not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home.\"That is why I established this scheme to support these people and their livelihoods at this critical time.\"Alison Thewliss for the SNP asked the Chancellorhe recognised that removing or reducing wage support levels in the furlough scheme prematurely would increase Universal Credit claims and ldquoforce workers back to work before its safe for them and risk a second peak \"Mr Sunak replied: \"Just to clary, there will be no reduction in the level of support for those on the scheme. Its crystal clear those on the scheme have that reassurance the level of support that they receive will not be changed.\"Tory backbencher Mel Stride, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said: ldquoThe extension of the furlough scheme, allowing furloughed employees to work part time, and with employers asked to contribute are all welcome steps from the Chancellor.\"However, he said the devil would be in the detail and the committee would carefully scrutinise the changes.ldquoThe Chancellor also said that there will be no changes to the scheme until July. This will be worrying for those who continue to fall through the gaps of the Governmentrsquos support measures such as the lack of furlough support to help cover idend income generated through self-employment.\"Outwith Westminster, Liz Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce hailed the furlough scheme extension as ldquogreat news.She said: ldquoBusinesses and employees across Scotland will be extremely relieved by the Chancellorrsquos decision to extend the furlough scheme to October rather than face a clf edge with its originally planned withdrawal at the end of June.ldquoThis direct employee financial support has been a leline which has enabled many jobs to be retained rather than businesses having to face making massive redundancies. As we begin to consider a lsquo to workplacersquo plan to restart the economy, flexibility in these schemes will be paramount to protecting jobs until businesses are able to trade normally once more.Ms Cameron said the SCC looked forward to seeing further detail on the proposed employersrsquo contribution.ldquoWe would ask that this takes into consideration, particularly for SMEs, their ability to pay contributions depending on how quickly their income recovers as lock down eases. Trading conditions will dfer depending on location and sector and the flexibility of the furlough scheme must take these factors on board.ldquoWe will continue our engagement with the Treasury to make sure business support remains flexible and accessible for Scottish businesses, she added.Andrew McRae, the Federation of Small Business Scotlandrsquos Policy Chairman, said: ldquoTodayrsquos shrewd decisions from the Chancellor will give thousands of large and small Scottish employers the right sort of flexibility. The move to allow operators to partially furlough their staff while they consider how to get back up to speed should mean more businesses have the right tools at their disposal.ldquoIn the coming weeks, smaller firms will want to understand the next steps for the scheme. Policymakers will need to carefully consider how to co-ordinate financial support for businesses with advice to firms about how and when to reopen safely, he added.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI Director-General, said firms would want more detail and asked for ministers to be willing to be flexiblethere were a second peak.ldquoExtending the furlough to avoid a June clf-edge continues the signicant efforts made already and will protect millions of jobs.\"Introducing much-needed flexibility is extremely welcome. It will prepare the ground for firms that are reawakening, while helping those who remain in hibernation. Thats essential as the UK economy revives step-by-step, while supporting livelihoods.\"Edwin Morgan for the Institute of Directors said plans for part-time s by the Government were welcome.\"A part-time furlough provides a much-needed launch ramp so businesses can start to get back up to speed. A more flexible approach will allow firms to raise activity levels in tandem with demand, helping to avoid cashflow challenges.\"We now need further clarity around employers contributions. Many firms that would normally be on strong footing are still in dire straits. The extension puts yet more onus on helping those who have been left out in the cold. Countless small company directors have found scant support, and Government shouldnt turn a blind eye to them,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-tells-english-firms-treat-scottish-staff-differently","story":"The First Minister said thatfirms had staff living in Scotland, they should follow the Scottish Governments lockdown guidance ldquowherever your head office is, wherever yoursquore based, not necessarily expect them toto work in the same manneras staff living in England.She said that included staff living in Scotland whose normal workplace was just over the border in England.The Scottish lockdown istighter than the UK Government version, which was changed this week for Englandwith the ldquostay at home message replaced by ldquostay alertThe UK version says people in England should work at home where possible, but says ldquofood production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientic research in laboratories should be open.The Scottish guidance is for construction to be closed.The UK guidance says it should be \"considered alongside local public health and safety requirements for Scotland\", but does not say which guidancetakes precedence.However at the Scottish Governmentrsquos daily briefing on Covid-, Ms Sturgeon was clear thatthe Scottish advice must apply to workers living in Scotland, eventhey normally commuted to work in England.She began by urging employers in Scotland not to reopen prematurely or put pressure on employees toto work too soon.She said: ldquoI know that the UK Government published guidance for businesses yesterday.ldquoI want to stress that this guidance is not yet operational in Scotland at this stage, since we are not currently encouraging more people to go back to work.ldquoI would ask instead that all employers follow the Scottish Government guidance.ldquoI am very grateful for the fact that the vast majority of employers have been so responsible throughout this crisis ndash so I am sure that most will do this, and will not urge workers to come back to work prematurely.ldquoAnd for employees, I would remind you thatyou think your working conditions are unsafe, you have rights under employment legislation.ldquoIf you have a trade union in your workplace, and you have concerns about your working conditions, you should also be able to talk to them.ldquoThe Scottish Government is working with employers and trade unions to develop guidance on safe workplaces which has the confidence of businesses and workers.Askedher message was the same to employers south of the border, for example in and around Carlisle, who had workers currently living in Scotland,Ms Sturgeon replied: ldquoYes, unequivocally.\"She went on: \"My message applied to all employers, clearly employing people who work in Scotland, I would hope all employers across the UK would be responsible, but my responsibility of course is for those who live in Scotland.ldquoSo I would say to employers, wherever your head office is, wherever yoursquore based,you are employing people who live in Scotland, have regard to the Scottish Government guidance.

It was like England taking Scotlandrsquos parliament away, explained the former Rangers, Aberdeen, and Leeds United player.Greg Clarkrsquos film began with Robertson at home in Aberdeen, preparing to say cheerio to his we, Kym, once more. He had mixed emotions about going, knowing how much he would miss home.But he also missed being a part of the game he clearly loved. ldquoI knowI didnrsquot have a job I wouldnrsquot be a happy person.Kym was told not to wave him off at the airport because it was ldquojust too sad\". So off he went.A short time later we saw this gentle, sensitive soul having his team talk interrupted by two men making a delivery to the dressing room.ldquoWhat the **** is this  roared Robertson. ldquoCould this not be done before we ******* arrive  **** me. Put the ******* thing down and **** off.Yes, he had lost none of his world-class cussing skills. If all the expletives were deleted from his speech the only things left would be some pronouns and a couple of lonely verbs.Having several sides to his character is what makes Robertson such a great subject for a documentary. He is part ruffian, part romantic a hard man who is not afraid to hug a player going through a dficult time a wee working class guy from Aberdeen who spends his time off exploring the mountains and visiting a Buddhist monastery . Not your average football manager, then.He was funny, too, as when he told Kym about his day in the mountains where the altitude made him feel dreadful. ldquoThe worst day of my le, he said, ldquoand Irsquove played at Albion Rovers.Real Kashmir FC was one of the new BBC Scotland channelrsquos biggest hits, and the sequel uses the same winning blend of matches and travelogue, with the story revolving around Robertson.The drama can be over-played at times ndash everything seems to be a crunch this or a high-stakes that ndash and the film could have done with more background on how Robertson came to be there in the first place. A few in-depth conversations with club owner Sandeep Chatoo would not have gone amiss either.Robertson is not the first Scot to find himself a stranger in a foreign land, as he saw for himself on a visit to the Scottish cemetery in Kolkata. He asked his guide how the local people got on with the Scots in colonial times.ldquoThe Scottish ruled us, tortured us, said the guide.ldquoTortured  said Robertson.ldquoVery much so.ldquoPhysical torture ldquoPhysical torture.Every day is a school day, even for coaches.There was not a lot of on the pitch action, largely because le was far more interesting off it, as when Robertson went to a dodgy part of town to use the internet during lockdown. That was where he met the marauding hounds. ldquoTherersquos *******  dogs waiting there, licking their lips, he said, finally opting to go another way.Occasionally, and despite having one of his sons playing in the team, being away from home got to him. Christmas Day was particularly hard.But then as we learned from the postscript to this engaging film, Robertson and his team, like millions of others around the globe, were about to have their lives upended by what commentators might call a dramatic last minute own goal, this one from the left foot of Mother Nature.Not even the mighty, and mighty likeable Robertson, could hustle his way out of that one.Available on iPlayer"},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  He s back  and he s cussing  at Real Kashmir FC","story":"BBC Scotland, pmFERGUSON, Guardiola, Klopp, Benitez: pretty decent football managers you would agree.

It was hard to disagree.On his arrival in India the government abolished Kashmirrsquos parliament and assumed direct control. It was like England taking Scotlandrsquos parliament away, explained the former Rangers, Aberdeen, and Leeds United player.Greg Clarkrsquos film began with Robertson at home in Aberdeen, preparing to say cheerio to his we, Kym, once more. He had mixed emotions about going, knowing how much he would miss home.But he also missed being a part of the game he clearly loved. ldquoI knowI didnrsquot have a job I wouldnrsquot be a happy person.Kym was told not to wave him off at the airport because it was ldquojust too sad\". So off he went.A short time later we saw this gentle, sensitive soul having his team talk interrupted by two men making a delivery to the dressing room.ldquoWhat the **** is this  roared Robertson. ldquoCould this not be done before we ******* arrive  **** me. Put the ******* thing down and **** off.Yes, he had lost none of his world-class cussing skills. If all the expletives were deleted from his speech the only things left would be some pronouns and a couple of lonely verbs.Having several sides to his character is what makes Robertson such a great subject for a documentary. He is part ruffian, part romantic a hard man who is not afraid to hug a player going through a dficult time a wee working class guy from Aberdeen who spends his time off exploring the mountains and visiting a Buddhist monastery . Not your average football manager, then.He was funny, too, as when he told Kym about his day in the mountains where the altitude made him feel dreadful. ldquoThe worst day of my le, he said, ldquoand Irsquove played at Albion Rovers.Real Kashmir FC was one of the new BBC Scotland channelrsquos biggest hits, and the sequel uses the same winning blend of matches and travelogue, with the story revolving around Robertson.The drama can be over-played at times ndash everything seems to be a crunch this or a high-stakes that ndash and the film could have done with more background on how Robertson came to be there in the first place. A few in-depth conversations with club owner Sandeep Chatoo would not have gone amiss either.Robertson is not the first Scot to find himself a stranger in a foreign land, as he saw for himself on a visit to the Scottish cemetery in Kolkata. He asked his guide how the local people got on with the Scots in colonial times.ldquoThe Scottish ruled us, tortured us, said the guide.ldquoTortured  said Robertson.ldquoVery much so.ldquoPhysical torture ldquoPhysical torture.Every day is a school day, even for coaches.There was not a lot of on the pitch action, largely because le was far more interesting off it, as when Robertson went to a dodgy part of town to use the internet during lockdown. That was where he met the marauding hounds. ldquoTherersquos *******  dogs waiting there, licking their lips, he said, finally opting to go another way.Occasionally, and despite having one of his sons playing in the team, being away from home got to him. Christmas Day was particularly hard.But then as we learned from the postscript to this engaging film, Robertson and his team, like millions of others around the globe, were about to have their lives upended by what commentators might call a dramatic last minute own goal, this one from the left foot of Mother Nature.Not even the mighty, and mighty likeable Robertson, could hustle his way out of that one.Available on iPlayer"},{"url":null,"title":"smaller-scots-juries-considered-clear-serious-trial-backlog","story":"A group of legal experts is to examine cutting the number of jurors below  to cope with social distancing measures in court.All new jury trials in sherf courts and the High Court are currently suspended, and justice secretary Humza Yousaf has warned a ldquovery signicant backlog is now building up.Mr Yousaf last month suggested smaller juries - the number was cut from  jurors to seven during World War II - and greater powers for sherfs could be the answer.He also floated the idea of solemn, or serious, trials taking place without any jury, but ditched itafter a backlash from MSPs and the legalprofession.Led by Lord Justice Clerk Lady Dorrian, Scotlandrsquos second most senior judge, the Working Group on Restarting Solemn Trials will now consider how jury size, better use of court space and new technology can be used to alleviate the problem.It will also consider what changes to the law may be needed to introduce the reforms.Lady Dorrian said: ldquoThe courts have been working extremely hard to deliver justice in the current challenging circumstances.\"The use of remote technology, for example, is progressing to cover as many types of case as is technically possible across a wide range of criminal and civil business.ldquoThis working group recognises the importance to the accused, to witnesses, and to their families, of continuing that progress to consider serious criminal cases.\"The particular challenges of conducting a jury trial, while also following public health guidelines to protect those engaged in the hearing, is a dficult balance to meet.The group includes other judges and lawyers, prosecutors, members of the Scottish Court Service and Sandy Brindley, chief executive of Rape Crisis Scotland.It will also liaise closely with Police Scotland, the Scottish Prison Service, Victim Support Scotland, and Scottish Womens Aid.Group member Ronnie Renucci, QC, president of the Scottish Criminal Bar Association, part of the Faculty of Advocates, said: \"These are indeed challenging times and the Faculty recognises that, notwithstanding the efforts already made by the courts, further work is required to identy and put in place suitable practical measures that will allow jury trials to resume in Scotland.\"The Faculty does not take lightly its important role in the trial process and is determined to do what it can to assist in the safe and speedy resumption of this fundamental part of our criminal justice system.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur said: ldquoJury trials are a pillar of Scotlandrsquos justice system, and have been for  years.

I wanted to bring culture into peoplersquos living rooms and to have a sense of everybody doing it at the same time, because one of the things that has been happening a lot is that people have been pre-recording these cultural experiences and sometimes they can seem dead on arrival ndash but I wanted this to feel very live.Beginning on Thursday at pm, Kay will launch this series of online literary and musical performances, produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and streamed on its YouTube channel. In its mix will be not only readings and singing, but conversation about art and poetry, as well as the strange times we are going through and the struggles they bring. Kay, who will host, hopes they will offer ldquofood for the soul.Having lost her father, pre-lockdown, and struggled with not being able to see her mother who is in a care home, she acknowledges that, like many, she has found these times hard. ldquoIrsquove been traumatised by lots of things. The last time I saw my mum I had to persuade the home to let me in just to say goodbye. Hers was one of the first homes in the country to go into lockdown, on March , and though at the time it felt shocking it was definitely a wise move.

That accompanying is partly what we have a Makar for. Itrsquos one of the reasons we turn to poets, singers and artists. In times like these we need such voices. ldquoI feel itrsquos important, now, to accompany people, she says, ldquobecause I think that this particular crisis has turned the volume up. Kind people have got kinder, anxious people more anxious. Itrsquos showed the huge problems we have in our society already. Poor people are more likely to die quicker of this virus, BAME people are more likely to die quicker ndash so I just wanted to create something that takes note of our time but also offers something up to them.The series is curated by Kay and produced by the National Theatre of Scotland in association with HOME Manchester and Edinburgh International Book Festival and School of Arts and Media, Salford. The writers and musicians are being paid in an attempt to support artists during this dficult period. The commitment to the four-month stretch of the series is also an acknowledgement that we will not be ing to social gathering, theatre-going and the live arts experience any time soon. Most of the summerrsquos live events, including Edinburghs festivals, are already cancelled.ldquoI think, says Kay, ldquoeven when people start trying to put their heads out of the door, theyrsquoll want to pull their head right back in. People are not going to gather publicly for some time. I donrsquot think theatres are going to be open till January next year, at the earliest, and even when things do open, people will be wary about gathering in public groups.Many artists, she observes, are shting to trying to deliver their work online ndash and this may be increasingly the way of the future. ldquoWe all needed to be travelling less, flying less, and so perhaps some of these new formats are new formats for our times and point the way to cleaner air.Makar To Makar will be part of the flowering of creativity that has already been happening online. ldquoWe know,\" says Kay, \"from reading about all dferent crises throughout time, that people will turn to poetry and music.

Fact. However, as soon as one person breaks that restriction, the odds change, by however small a degree. Fact. Multiply that one person by any number and the odds of transmission begin to shorten exponentially. Fact. The now infamous R number is just a reflection of those odds.The obvious conclusion, however unpalatable, is that any move whatsoever away from total isolation, in whatever set of circumstances in respect of social distancing, PPE equipment, hand washing, masks, and so on, will cause that R number to increase. And such a scenario will remain the case until a vaccine cure is produced. Fact.An obvious corollary of this is that the virus will spread, the population will become infected, people will die. Therefore, current strategies, however well-intentioned, are merely ways of seeming to be doing something positive when, in fact, denying the virological evidence from the scientic community. In other words, no matter what Boris Johnson or Nicola Sturgeon tell us, without a vaccine, any loosening of current restrictions in the direction of \"opening up\" the country will, without doubt, lead to fatalities. Fact. Perhaps, as in any struggle, this a price society is willing to accept. Who knows However, the political, economical, social and personal cost of any measures are, of course, quite a dferent matter. But they will not, cannot, change the facts of this pandemics reproduction trajectory. It is said that we are \"at war\" with this disease and we know that people die in wars. Yet apparently the first casualty of war is truth. So maybe a sad dose of truthful reality might help us all to grasp, to deal with, but most vital of all, to cultivate the patience required to defeat the horror that is coronavirus.Gerard McCulloch, Saltcoats.SCIENCE is simply defined as a body of knowledge acquired by measurement, repeated measurement, precise measurement. Mathematics is considered Queen of Science.Scientists giving advice about Covid- management are unable to measure, with laboratory support, incidence or prevalence in the living community. A further dficulty arises in the deceased community due to lack of precisionof definition of cause of death. Certied involvementof Covid- in causing an iniduals death may be a scientic statement, with technicalsupport, but may be no more than a guess which may be plausible rather than credible.Politicians who lean upon scientists for advice must bear in mind that the quality of the advice given and received is no better than the reliability of the sources of the data utilised. Those who lack scientic training, such as politicians trained in law, may demonstrate excessive trust in what a scientist unwisely alleges. Unfortunately, at the present time many politicians are experienced only in politics and are vulnerable to charlatans.Dr William Durward, Bearsden.The BBC Disclosure programme quoted scientists whose modelling suggested that more than , Covid- deaths could have been preventedScotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier .However, for that to have happened Scotland would have needed to be a normal independent country in control of finance, welfare plus our borders and air transport rather than be wedded to a bumbling and shambolic Westminster Government.On January  Boris Johnson ignored the WHO declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on March  dismissed the pandemic as not medically rational, which has resulted in the UK having the highest number of Covid- deaths per head of population in the world and trashed the UK economy with the loss of one million jobs.We donrsquot know whether Nicola Sturgeon received the same medical and scientic advice as Boris Johnson, but she has certainly handled the situation much better and been more straightforward with the public.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh EH.NOT very long ago, Nicola Sturgeon told us that she would enter into a grown-up conversation with the Scottish public about coronavirus. So far it appears to consist of \"shut up and do what you are told\", but we can hope that it will eventually begin.When it does, a good start would be to be informed whether Scotland is to have its own Covid Alert Level, which seems to be a useful tool in the battle to get out of lockdown. Crucially, it also would allow us to come to our own conclusions as to whether the measures in place at any time are necessary and proportionate.Or does the First Minister not think we are grown up enough to handle such information Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrrecommends to readers that during the phased release from Covid lockdownyou happen to live in Scotland we should listen to Nicola Sturgeon for national guidance.If there is indeed statistical medical evidence justying Scotland following a dferent exit programme from England and indeed other nations within the UK, an obvious question is raised.Where does the argument for the issue being directed by local circumstance end  There are fairly obvious and rational reasons why pubs and restaurants in Scotland should all reopen at the same time. However.the fall in the rate of contagion is consistently and signicantly dferent across areas of Scotland perhaps it should be left to local authorities to decide, on the evidence, when their own schools should reopen.The latest results from the National Records of Scotland indicate that in terms of deaths involving Covid per , of the population, people residing in Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board areas are the worst hit by the virus. However Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are relatively least affected. I would suggest that schools in these three areas could reopen before the schools in very badly affected authorities such as Inverclyde.Bill Brown, Milngavie.NICOLA Sturgeon determines that Scotland requires dferent, more restrictive Covid- lockdown criteria to England because the circumstances are dferent. Fair enough, but that same logic applies to areas within Scotland, such as the islands, where virus cases have been relatively light.Somewhat ironically perhaps, the new English restrictions are more relevant to the present situation in Orkney than the Edinburgh-imposed ones.James Miller, Kirkwall.READING Guy Stenhouses articleI was not surprised by the points made, coming from the financial perspective as they did. They followed neatly on from the UK Prime Ministerrsquos broadcast on Sunday evening and pointed to the direction to be taken on the Monday.I was, however, shocked by its later tone and lack of empathy shown towards a workforce thrown back at short notice to an environment which may not be fully prepared for this and social issues arising such as childcare. It went on, it seemed, to weigh and to evaluate the limited contribution of those most vulnerable to the virus by stressing the lower death rates in younger people who could nowto work and contribute to economic recovery. It alluded to lestyle behaviours among some of these vulnerable groups and apportioned blame for the consequences of these in the current crisis to those suffering from drug and alcohol dependence and even cake consumption, presumably in light of the consequences of obesity.At a point in our history when the positives arise from the care and compassion of those caring for those affected by Covid-, be it in the NHS, care at home or in homes and by that section of the workforce still involved in food production and delivery and sales, plus our postal workers and refuse collectors and many others, often in jobs which are not highly paid, statistics only contribute to one part of the whole picture and to the decisions to be taken in these challenging times.Margo Biggs, Falkirk.MARIANNE Taylor bemoans the fact that tone of lockdown debates constantly needs ldquoto judge the motives of others within an ideological context . As I pointed out recently, we have had, for a decade in Scotland and for almost a similar period across the whole of the UK, political leaders who have made ideological causes the central plank of their drive for power, and the bedrock of their policies once in power. In doing so, they have fostered an atmosphere where binary, ideological argument is the order of the day.It can surely be of no surprise to Ms Taylor that almost every issue in UK politics is thus framed  If, when discussing garden centres, independence or Brexit, one side says black, itrsquos an absolute given that the other will say white.I fear this trend may continue for a generation.Stuart Brennan, Glasgow G.I WONDER what the UK Governments response will be when the country finally emerges from this horrendous period.

When it came to creating the menu there was a scene in the with Hagrid and Harry before the dragons arrived. The starter I created, Dragon of the Wood, was a venison tartare with celeriac remoulade and a smoked mayonnaise. I used wood sorrel and mushrooms as well - things you might associate with a walk in the woods.ldquoIn the heats the judges asked for more theatre so for the final the starter was presented to them after a fire-eating display. It was tougher than I thought it would be linking the food to a story.Read more: Lockdown recipes: Chef Paul Tamburrini brings you his family feastsEach night a team of eight chefs compete to have their starter, fish course, meat and dessert chosen for the banquet. And hosting this yearrsquos series for the first time is Scots comedian Susan Calman who provided moments of light relief when needed and picked up the chefs when tensions were mounting high.ldquoIt was great to have Susan around in the kitchen. I just think she is very funny, but she was also very supportive and would keep us going when we needed it.Facing the judging  of Irish restaurateur Oliver Peyton, restaurateur Andi Oliver and food critic Matthew Fort, had the finalists on tenterhooks to find outtheir dishes had made it through.While reading was one interest, Mrs Hall-McCarronrsquos main passion growing up was food. Although from Edinburgh, it was holidays on the west coast on her fatherrsquos boat that sparked her interest in cooking. Catching ingredients such as langoustines and scallops proved to be an inspiration.She worked in a restaurant as a teenager before going to catering school, but was keen to get back into the kitchen and worked at Number  in Glasgow and Slaley Hall in Northumbria before heading to the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh. After working in Dubai for  months, Mrs Hall-McCarron ed home where she took up a post at Tom Kitchinrsquos restaurant in Leith. She worked at another Kitchin venture Castle Terrace, in the capital, but with along with husband Shaun McCarron they decided to open up their own place.ldquoJust before lockdown we had started a takeaway service, but then it became clear we would have to close. My husband and I have only recently started a meal delivery service. The dishes come with cooking instructions for you to finish at home as we cant serve it hot.

More than half of UK farmers have had their milk price cut due to the disruption.“It is good to see the dairy industry taking the initiative here but this does not let our governments off the hook. They need to do more#, the MP said,  #with restaurants closed and orders from vital export markets down, our dairy farmers need help to keep going.#They face challenges that cannot be papered over through programmes of worker support. You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now, why does not Nicola change the dictate for Shetland  We would love to sunbath also, between the snow showers!!!!!😂😂😂😂How fortunate that the Scottish, Welsh and Irish leaders are maintaining their more sensible , balanced and wary approaches .Enlighten us Haydn, why is the infection rate lowerin England than in Wales and Scotland  I for one am not the least confused by the messages, just what is confusing you She niver agrees wIth what the rest off the UK IS DOINGBruce, you make it look asNicola, is acting like a Tory##..The Tory policy being##..me, me, me and melolSince you appear to not know, there has been confusion in Britain today about the actual meaning of BoJo’s statement yesterdayand , as I write, he is trying to explain himself away on TV. THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach.

The dference appears to be largely in emphasis and timing.“But this isn’t the time for our national leaders to be playing politics. It’s critical that we have a clear message that people continue to follow the advice and guidelines.”The convener said he was not too concerned that dferent parts of the UK were thinking about the lockdown exit dferently.“In one sense everybody talks about ‘the science’. There’s no such thing as ‘the science’. There’s ‘science’, and as long as they’re taking their evidence from the same science it could be perfectly reasonable for dferent parts of the UK to go at a slightly dferent pace.“You can find a scientist to back up whatever you want. I’m concerned they are now going to start using this to emphasise political dferences. I think I would expect more from our leaders at a time of national emergency.”Mr Bell stressed people had to get back to work at some time, especiallythey wanted to preserve things like the “world-class health service” which they benefit from.He added that, when that time comes, #we do have to show the same sort of courage and commitment that our key workers at the moment – our health workers, bus drivers, ferry crews, care workers and shop assistants – are doing.”Following the prime minister’s address, residents in England will be able to carry out more outdoor exercise as of Wednesday.Mr Johnson also said primary schools south of the border may begin to re-open in June, as well as non-essential shops, while the hospitality industry could see operations begin again from July.He added people in England should be “actively encouraged” to go to workthey were unable to work from home.Mr Johnson said it would “soon be the time” to consider imposing a -day quarantine on people coming into the country by air.But the prime minister’s comments came as official data showed infections had risen in Germany, just days after the country eased its lockdown restrictions.Mr Johnson was criticised for his new “stay alert” message which he was advising in favour of keeping the “stay at home” dictum that has been the key message in tackling the virus head-on.Ms Sturgeon said the “core principles” of the lockdown measures remained in place, although she was willing to loosen restrictions enough to allow people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.She told journalists: “The objectives now for all of us must be to consolidate and solidy that progress. We mustn’t squander our progress by easing up too soon or by sending mixed messages that make people think it’s okay to ease up.”She added: “Let me be very blunt about the consequenceswe were to do that. People will die unnecessarily, and instead of being able to loosen restrictions, hopefully in the near future, we will be faced instead with having to tighten them.“We must not take that risk.” raquoAnd any way I don#t thing we voted her inOnly way Shetland will get a world class health system ishe is planning to sell it to one of the Nordics# once lockdown ends the community will be back to fundraising for equipment, longer waiting lists due to lack of medical and dental services for months, commuting to mainland Scotland for treatment etc. Faroes had  deaths,  cases in care homes, is covid free and out of lockdown..."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus business support rules must be loosened in shetland demands msp wishart ","story":"Shetland representative Beatrice Wishart has written to the Scottish finance secretary Kate Forbes pointing out that £ million is being made available in England via local authorities.

of","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThere’s only so much looking at a blank page on screen that’s possible before you have to admitdefeat.In the absence of any golf, indeed any sports at all, and with a pledge to try not to add to the news and commentary around the Covid- crisis already made sometimes it’s very much a case of panic.So I decided to head off around the world.It’s easy.Even with nothing much flying, huge restrictions on general travel, and ‘lockdown’ still very much in evidence it’s still possible with a bit of imagination.Lots of things are.‘Around the World in  Trains’ by Monisha Rajesh is the kind of adventure that most of us probably, deep down, only dream about.The notion of giving everything up and heading off on a , mile journey by train, most of the time certainly not travelling first-class, with only the confidence of your publisher behind you, might terry most.The dference here being that Rajesh has a ‘track’ record hereand already had managed ‘Around India in  Trains’ to considerable acclaim.The ‘gamble’ wasn’t so much that everything hinged on the possibility of a book-deal, that the house might have to be sold to pay for the trip, or that anything could go possibly wrong: this was the sort of adventure that comes with the kind of safety net that wannabe travel writers might only care to dream about.The ‘gamble’ was a sure thing.The best kind.She loves train travel.She knows she already possesses a charming style and wit .She is fearless, adventurous, resourceful and confident.She probably had the advance in the bank and a Bloomsbury credit card tucked away somewhere safe.She took her fiancé to sell for body parts, just in case.The bases were covered.But it didn’t feel like that and, despite being incredibly jealous, you easily get sucked into her world of ‘roughing it’ amongst strange farts, loud snores, despicable train ‘etiquette’, and uncomfortable travel bedfellows, depending on which rails you are traversing.These strange times provide a unique opportunity for those of us who, luckily, can get lost inside their own heads.Days of reading and Netflix, YouTube documentaries and Sky box sets can keep the madness at bay whilst you head into the sixth straight week of nightsht.That and doing the lottery.You can disappear, both into your own and somebody ’s fantasy adventures, safe in the knowledge that you will never have the cojones to even challenge yourself to anything more dangerous than a co-op ‘seafood selection’ a couple of days beyond its ‘best before’ date, nor less basic than a -star hotel in exotic, far-flung, hot-spots like Cyprus or Tenere .I find myself vicariously earthy and ‘real’ eating a ‘three squeaks’ aperit after haggling with a one-legged hawker on a street corner, before hitting the hay for the fth consecutive night with a fellow traveller who now smells sweetly ripe, despite washing his feet where I shave.I’m adventurous, but only in my own head.I can yearn for the real, authentic, deal, but would probably settle for a ‘Westworld’ or ‘Total Recall’ futuristic implant.I could pack it in and head for the opal depletedmines of Coober Pedy, or the aptly named Opalton in Australia.Following in the footsteps, and bore holes, of prospectors who either struck it rich or went broke trying I’m there with the jack-hammer, just praying for a glint of green.Sold the Mondeo and the golf clubs, bought my claim and a second-hand excavator, and will surely strike it rich where every other damned fool either failed or moved on.Claiming a redundant, abandoned, dangerous, tunnel to the centre of the earth is the stuff of the original ‘ers.Except they’d have got there first.I’d make a great Outback Opal Hunter: I’ve got the Drizabone hat, with corks, and am getting used to working in the dark with headlights.Maybe I’ll start digging around in the shed and see what I could find to take to auction.Become a Pawnstar or Auction Hunter, rather than just ‘flogging it’, whatever ‘it’ turns out to be, for a £.I’ll head to Vegas, spin Chumlee a great line about my cousin Donald, and cash in on the great-great-grandmother.Memo to self: check the lineage and silence Bill Lawson.Ach, I might even disappear up to Dutch Harbour for a while and see what the fishing’s like with my old pal, Sig Hansen on the ‘Northwestern’.The Barents Sea looks like a doddle compared to Broad Bay, although the weather might require an extra pair of Damart.I might watch Ricky Gervais’ ‘After Le’ again the first time was a bit ‘misty’ in parts.I recommend it to you.In between I’ll do the odd lottery, online naturally, just to add to the suspense when I get ‘lucky’.Lucky is a relative term.The ‘congratulations, you have a winning

now you’re in the ‘ballpark’, aren’t you Nah.A trillion seconds would take us all to the year .Yup,  years into the future.So how long to the end of the lockdown and ‘things’ get back to what’s being called the ‘new normal’ As long as it takes to guarantee the safety of each and every one of us, especially the most vulnerable, should be the answer, but these are strange times.Don’t count the

Thanks also must go to Galgorm LOL  who allowed us the use of their hall to make up the packages.But a huge amount of thanks and credit must go to the members of the club and the band for their attitude and desire to help their community despite the ongoing situation.It has been extremely encouraging to see so many examples of the loyal orders and bands coming to the forefront to help their communities and it serves to prove that our Institutions and Associations are about much more than parades!Mervyn Stirling, Bandmaster of Ahoghill Loyal Sons of William said: When we were first contacted by the club about the idea we agreed to it right away.We as a band had been trying to help our members and their families as best we could but this enabled us to take that level of support to another level. When distributing the care packages it was very apparent how grateful and appreciative people were, even just for us as a band to be thinking of them.Its not until youre on the ground can you fully appreciate just how isolated some people are during this period, so for us as a band to be able to help those people is fantastic.Wed just like to express our thanks to Ballymena and Harryville Apprentice Boys of Derry branch club for reaching out to us and giving us the opportunity to help our community.I think it shows perfectly what bands and loyal orders are all about, and thats helping their communities and being there for one another.

Unlike England and the Republic of Ireland, Stormont#s blueprint does not include firm dates and will instead be guided by conditions.The recovery strategy on how lockdown measures will be lted in the coming months was presented to the Assembly yesterday as nine further Covid- deaths were confirmed, bringing the total death toll here to .The local exit strategy on when businesses and schools could reopen came two days after Boris Johnson unveiled his #Stay Alert# slogan.However the leaders of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have said they will continue with their current #Stay Home# plan instead.Read More Is coronavirus roadmap taking us in the right direction  Eight sectors of NI le express their viewsComing nearly two weeks after the Republic#s timetable-driven plan, it potentially puts the island on two dferent paths on emergence from lockdown.The Executive#s new five-stage plan will be subject to change, depending on the progress made in tackling the pandemic.In the first stage of edging le back towards normality:Groups of four to six people who do not share a household will be allowed to meet outdoors while maintaining social distancing.Those unable to work from home will be encouraged toto work on a phased basis.Large outdoor-based retailers such as garden centres are permitted to reopen.Drive-through church services will be available and churches will open for private prayer.Outdoor spaces, public sport amenities and drive-through cinemas will open, including some water activities, golf courses and tennis clubs.Under the plan, the Executive said its decision-making will be led by science and not the calendar.First Minister Arlene Foster said there was no set pathway for lting restrictions but changes in the rules will be guided by science and in the safest possible way forward.We don#t want to keep any restriction in place any longer than we have to, but in relaxing any measure we must be cognisant of the potential effects in the transmission of the virus and our ability to save lives, she said.Northern Ireland#s R-rate of virus transmission is at approximately ., but medics have said they want to drive it down further.Read MoreSuzanne Breen:Opinion Safety first approach to save lives trumps any criticism of ergence from London lineDr Connor Bamford, a virologist at Queen#s University Belfast, said the roadmap lacked detail and more information is needed about what will happen in terms of moving forward.The guidance is very limited, there really should be more explanation around shielding and testing in particular, he said.On not including dates in the plan, Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill said: We looked very carefully at the issue of putting timelines and specic dates to certain areas and we decided against that for the reason that people want light at the end of the tunnel. We don#t want to build up expectation and then you have to move back.While the restrictions are to be reviewed every three weeks as set out in law, there may be reviews where no change is warranted and others when more change is possible.According to the blueprint, the second step will see groups of  being able to meet outdoors, team sports training allowed on a non-contact basis in small groups, the reopening of some libraries and open-air museums, as well as indoor activities involving limited contact of less than  minutes and with two to four people.The third step will see groups of up to  being able to gather outside, the reopening of more libraries as well as museums and galleries, concert and theatre rehearsals resuming and larger indoor gatherings.The fourth step will see socially distanced church services, the resumption of competitive sport behind closed doors or with a limited number of spectators, leisure centres reopening and outdoor concerts resuming on a restricted basis.Large indoor gatherings, nightclubs, concerts, close physical contact sports, restaurants, cafes, pubs and early years education will be included in the final step five, relaxation.While business leaders welcomed the roadmap, many said the lack of dates would be problematic in terms of making plans. Ann McGregor, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce, said while it was a signicant step forward, the absence of dates meant planning ahead would be a challenge for business.Aodhan Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, added: We welcome visibility on the route out of lockdown but we will need to see a timeline to allow retailers and our supply chains to prepare.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he was disappointed by the decision not to include dates, but said he understood the Executive#s concerns.Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken described the plan as a start and said it sets a direction of travel.TUV leader Jim Allister said that the devolved regions of the UK were happy to follow a joint plan when receiving Treasury funding, but now that it looked like the lockdown could be eased there was a preference for dference.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said: Confirmation by Western Health and Social Care Trust that there has been a % drop in people attending AEis deeply worrying.It reiterates what clinicians working in emergency departments right across Northern Ireland are reporting.Fears that people presenting with symptoms of serious medical conditions - such as heart failure or cancer - who would have previously attended an accident and emergency department but are staying at home have also been expressed.Ms Cameron continued: Advocacy charities such as NI Chest, Heart  Stroke have shared this concern, with research indicating those with heart problems and symptoms of a stroke have been reluctant to seek help at hospital during this crisis.At last week#s Health Committee, I asked the Public Health Agency to strongly consider the public health messaging necessary to encourage people to not ignore the warning signs and to get help they need from a health professional. I am pleased that they intend to run the FAST campaignon social media and in GP surgeries and supermarkets.Whilst tackling Covid- remain a critical priority in the delivery of health and social care currently, it is also important that ministers signal a commitment and a plan to ramp up routine and elective services moving forward.We would encourage anyone experiencing symptoms requiring urgent attention to seek help through our GP or local emergency department.The Director of Acute Hospitals at the Western Trust, Geraldine McKay, echoed Ms Cameron#s call.She said: There has been a notable decrease in the number of attendances in our Emergency Departmentsdue to the coronavirus pandemic.We have compared attendances for the seven-week period from  March  to  April  and for the same period in  for both Altnagelvin Hospital and South West Acute Hospital. We are very grateful to the public for their ongoing support for the health service during this dficult time and how well people locally have taken on board the message to Stay at Home and maintain Social Distancing.The Trust is urging the public not to put off seeking medical attention for urgent conditions.No one from the Public Health Agency or the Department of Health was available.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Andit doesn#t go down, restrictions could be toughened again, the First Minister added.Also speaking at the Stormont daily Covid- briefing, Deputy First Minster Michelle O#Neill said any decisions to lt restrictions would be guided all the way by scientic evidence as she defended the decision not to include dates for introducing any changes in the plan.We will not keep any measure in place for any longer than is necessary, Ms O#Neill said.I understand people want to see that light at the end of the tunnel and we would much prefer to say we#re going to do this on a certain date. The reality is that we have to be guided by the science, what#s the best interest of public health.She said the current , tests a day capacity would soon be increased to , - a cornerstone of the recovery plan.Mrs Foster said the testing system sat alongside NHS capacity and the infection rate as the three key factors that would influence when the plan would move from one step to another.The DUP leader said the flexibility built in to the plan would allow the Executive to move as quickly as possible once the conditions were right.If we could with certainty set dates, we would have set dates, but I think what we wanted to do to make sure that we set out the step-by-step process and then keep the flexibility to be able to move when that R number is at an appropriate place, she said. At all times, we will be guided by what#s happening to the R number. Today that is at .. We like to think that it is going in the right direction andit does go in the right direction, we will respond to it.Mrs Foster said timeframes outlined by other countries are often so heavily caveated that one has to ask, is it of any use When they get to that date, they may not be able to move forward and then people will be disappointed, the First Minister said. I hope that people can understand when they look at the steps thatwe comply,we push the R number down, then we will be moving in that direction.But she also warned thatchanges to social distancing were brought in and the R rate rose to above one, the Executive would have to consider reintroducing restrictions.If we move forward and take a step and the R number goes above one then we will have to possibly look at coming backwards again. We may have to take a step back.I hope we don#t and I hope we move in a way that is positive, so that we can give some certainty to people and our economy can begin to start on the road to recovery. That#s critical for the well-being of everybody.Ms O#Neill said it would be a fine balancing act to make the right decision on dates for reducing restrictions . You can come out too quick, you can run the risk of a second peak coming very quickly, the risk of the health service being overrun, the risk of us being in the place we have been trying to avoid for the last  weeks, said Ms O#Neill.There#s always a fine balance between going quickly or too slow. It has to be struck and even now, no one can predictand when a second peak can happen.We believe the step, the baby steps to walk us out of this, is helping us to avoid the second wave as best we can, but we need the public#s help. The best way we can get there is by following the public health advice.Ms O#Neill said that while the plan was based on the Executive#s own modelling and scientic advice, there would be co-operation with the Republic of Ireland throughout.Clearly, we need to work together across this island and we need to move together on issues when we can, she said.Where we can be joined up, we will continue to do that.Mrs Foster also said there will be news about business rates soon to help those most affected by the crisis. There#s been a rates holiday for three months and there will be further developments in relation to rates in the coming days, she said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In step one of the roadmap, the Executive says the first plans for churches will be drive-through church services and buildings will open for private prayer with appropriate social distancing and cleaning of shared contact hard surfaces.By step four, church services will be allowed subject to social distancing and other factors.The Executive also urges those with responsibility to exercise them in line with the public health guidance of the day.TransportPublic transport is operating currently with limited capacity to allow for social distancing.But the Executive#s reinforced message throughout its plan for travel is that people should walk or cycle where possible.It says reducing and staggering demand through continued home working and staggered start times for businesses would assist as social distancing requirements remain in place.Eventually public transport will be operating a full service - but the message on walking and cycling remains.Going outRestaurants, cafes and pubs will be among the last places to open - and willon a limited basis to begin with. Before that, hairdressers and other contact retail outlets such as fitness studios will be allowed to open.Among the first places to open will be garden centres - but their cafes restaurants will be restricted.Nightclubs and concerts will be allowed on a limited basis in the final step.SportBy the final step of the roadmap, the Executive sees spectators allowed to attend live events on a restricted basis.There will be ato competitive sport and the resumption of close physical contact sports.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a parish, I have absolutely no idea how we would go about a drive-through church service as it#s completely new territory. I can#t see some parishes being able to facilitate that option, he said.I have no doubt that many of our parishioners will be pleased to able to have private prayer. Now we have to figure out how we do that safely and it will require much planning.Our own church building is massive and our problem will be trying to manage keeping a place of that size both clean and safe.

He said offering a food delivery service isn#t viable, but hopes to offer food collection to customers.The new reality is that restaurants are going to have to become takeaways to have any type of revenue.Licensing laws for breweries in Northern Ireland also means he can#t offer a drinks delivery service.It#s so frustrating.

I think it will help support people who are trying to do everything they can to adhere to the existing rules and give them an opportunity to be with their loved ones.Ms McLaughlin described Covid- as unpredictable and felt that including any specic dates on reopening could have backed the Executive into a corner.There#s an awful lot of businesses out there who can#t see a future for themselves and they#re very vulnerable, particularly businesses in the hospitality and tourism sector, she added.Of the five-stage process, they are at the very end of that, so there could be a lot of stress within those organisations. South Antrim MLA Mr Blair explained that any implementation of the road map will solely depend on the latest scientic advice available when decisions are made.A lot of the outworkings on this will depend on the implementation of the plan and that implementation has to be based on the medical and scientic advice available as the Executive works its way through this, he said.I am well aware that some people might have understandably expected more detail on the economy. We have been told that is still to come and we await the detail of that.I would stress that any economic plan that comes forward must contain some information regarding an economic stimulus plan which will reflect as an absolute priority that some sectors will emerge from this situation at a dferent rate than others.Mr Aiken said his party welcomed the plan and that it set out a direction of travel for the region.He also outlined his appreciation to the Executive for coming together and agreeing to the measures.That cohesion needs to continue as we fight back against Covid- and look towards reopening our economy, he said.Many businesses continue to fight for survival and will need as much detail and support as possible, otherwise they won#t survive. The huge economic support measures coming from the UK Government are very welcome, but we need to ensure that it is getting to businesses and iniduals as quickly as possible.Strangford Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said the measures provided hope of what the future might look like and backed plans for testing.I welcome the fact that there is a comprehensive plan in place for testing and tracing as we move into the next stages and that the Executive has opted not to put dates against each stage, allowing themselves, instead, to be guided by science, the correct course of action, she added.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She added: We will of course look at the detail, but at first glance it will give help and certainty to employers around Northern Ireland.Ann McGregor, chief executive of the NI Chamber, said the extension was a welcome move. Over the coming months, the Government should continue to listen to business and evolve the scheme in line with what#s happening within the business environment, she said.Further support may yet be needed for companies who are unable to operate for an extended period, or those who face reduced capacity or demand due to ongoing restrictions.Chancellor Rishi Sunak told MPs that from August there will be greater flexibility to allow furloughed staff to begin ing to work.Employers currently using the scheme will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time, he said. And we will ask employers to start sharing with the Government the cost of paying people#s salaries. Under the scheme - which has already cost the taxpayer £bn - staff will continue to receive the current level of support through a combination of state and employer contributions. Details will be announced at the end of the month following consultations with business, but officials have acknowledged the state will continue to make the largest contribution. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts said: It will be a relief to many of our members and the wider business community that the Chancellor has extended the scheme.Stressing the need for flexibility, South Belfast MP Claire Hanna said: While we await more detail, it is very welcome that workers will continue to receive %, at minimum, of their salary. While this is a very positive announcement and will provide clarity and relief to many across Northern Ireland, it is important that the UK government will be flexible with people and businesses, and to reflect the #phasing back# and part time working that many businesses will require, to ensure they we don#t face a new clf edge in October.Alliance MP Stephen Farry said further detail was needed on how it will operate from the summer.Meanwhile, Mr Sunak has said he is looking at the best thing to do with the coronavirus self-employment income support scheme. He was asked in a BBC interviewhe would extend the scheme enabling the self-employed to claim a taxable grant of % of their average monthly trading profits, up to a cap. He said: We#re looking at the best thing to do but ... the reason for that is slightly dferent in that many of those self-employed people are not in sectors which are necessarily closed or have an employer who has reduced their hours. It is a slightly dferent scheme which I was clear about at the beginning, but what I would say to those people, millions of those people who are eligible, ahead of schedule the scheme is now open, they can apply this week, they#ll be getting the emails and they will have the same amount of support based on their historical earnings ... by the end of the month.

The Executive published its much-anticipated lockdown exit proposals, but those in the most at-risk groups will probably have to remain isolated in their homes for the foreseeable future.Experts have warned it is highly unlikely that those who are shielding, which includes transplant and cancer patients and people living with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , will be able to follow the exit strategy at the same rate as the rest of the population.It means that even when family visits are permitted, anyone who is shielding will not be able to take part.Tens of thousands of people will also be unable toto work, while children of people who are shielding may not be able to attend school, evenclasses recommence.Dr Connor Bamford, a virologist from Queen#s University Belfast, said the future for people who are shielding remains uncertain. He has called for more clarity to ensure that people do not put themselves at risk.I can see the -week shielding period being extended, he said.It#s important to protect the vulnerable and that won#t change for the foreseeable future. I think one of the ways it is going to be possible to lt restrictions from people who are shielding is to really reduce the presence of the virus in the community.It#s hard to think how we could increase social distancing, so we need to increase testing and contact tracing in order to do that.The guidance is very limited, there really should be more explanation around shielding and testing in particular.The roadmap lacks details and we need more information about what is going to be happening moving forward.Dr Bamford said the ideal scenario would see people who are shielding being allowed out of their homes when a comprehensive testing and tracing policy is put in place identying when areas are Covid-free.However, testing and contact tracing would identy any outbreaks and alert those who are shielding to the presence of the virus in their community, meaning that they could take additional precautions to keep themselves safe.This may include removing children from school or sending them to live where for the duration of an outbreak so they can continue to go to school when a parent is considered high risk.Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association#s Northern Ireland council, said: Until we have a reduced number of cases in the community, people who are shielding are still at risk.As a result, the sensible thing to do is to continue to shield patients.The R number would need to be considerably lower than it currently is at the moment , it would need to go lower than it was before we told patients to shield, and we need testing and contact tracing to allow us to track what is going on in the community.GPs across the UK were asked to identy the most at risk patients and send them letters telling them to shield for at least  weeks.Initially , people here were sent a letter. It was later extended to ,.Anyone who is shielding has been advised to completely isolate themselves from anyone who may be coming into contact with the virus, including anyone in their household such as spouses and children. This includes sleeping and eating in a separate room and using a dferent bathroom.The Department of Health was asked whether it has considered extending theof time it asks people to shield or what measures will be put in place to protect the most at-riskshielding is not continued beyond the original -week period.A spokeswoman from the Department of Health said: There is currently no change to the advice contained in the shielding letter.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those promoting them shouldn#t enjoy the tax breaks and public recognition that charitable status brings.The Charity Commission said the letter will be considered in detail.The purpose of charity law is not to saya certain belief is right or wrong. The definition of a charity in law says that you must be established for exclusively charitable purposes, a spokesperson said.A purpose must be beneficial, not harmful. If any organisation, including a religious one, requires improper pressure to be placed on people to remain within that organisation against their will, or completely withdraw from society, then there is likely to be more harm than benefit. A purpose must also not promote hatred towards others who do not share the same religion. The commission is considering in detail the issues raised.A spokesman for Core Issues Trust said it would welcome active engagement with the Charity Commission.Core Issues Trust supports counselling choice for iniduals whether they are from no-faith, other-faith or are Christian believers, who seek to live according to primary, personal values, the spokesman said.

Our Belfast Agenda sets out to improve quality of le for our residents, so this type of application is very welcome indeed.We#ve made changes to our processes - for example, changing from paper-based applications to applications by email in response to the Covid- lockdown - and I#m delighted to say that our planning team is continuing to provide an excellent, professional and rigorous service, helping to keep the economy moving forward.It#s reported that Apex Housing Association is to manage the completed social rented homes, with the affordable homes to be offered to first-time buyers or those who do not currently own a home.The Braidwater Group has been operating for more than  years, and currently has eight developments with nearly , homes in construction across Northern Ireland.Finbarr Grogan, planning and technical director, told Business Eye it was an exciting step forward after a year of planning.There is high demand for social and affordable housing in this area and we have had a positive engagement process with all key stakeholders, which we believe will result in a scheme that will work for the whole community in west Belfast, he said.At this time it is crucial to try and keep the economy moving forward and we recognise the vast effort of our professional team in finalising a complex planning application remotely during the coronavirus lockdown. We are also very pleased and grateful that Belfast City Council and its planning team is able to begin to process this application, among the many other priorities and challenges it is facing at the moment. We are delighted the council was able to adapt normal working procedures and practices to remotely accept and validate such a major application so quickly in the current environment. Our plan is to go straight to buildapproval is granted and this quick turnaround will be of particular importance for our local construction sector, which has faced a very dficult few months.We have listened to what the community wants from this scheme. There will be a healthy iety of dwelling types and character areas. A new bus service to the site will enhance local linkages along with cycle lanes and trails. The #Buy Social# programme at Glenmona will ensure that job opportunities will be offered to apprentices, long-term unemployed, education leavers and professional trainees. We have also focused on sustainability, bioersity and environmental factors, with plans to retain existing and plant over , new native species trees, adding to the wooded character that will last into the future.A decision on the application is likely to be taken by the planning committee at Belfast City Council later this year.

The job retention scheme will be extended, for four months, until the end of October. By that point, we will have provided eight months of support to British people and businesses.

Paddy Simpson, of Fortuna Enterprises Ltd, owns Brunswick Moviebowl in Pennyburn Industrial Estate as well as two hotels in Belfast. With the British government’s poundbn job-retention scheme running until the end of June, Mr Simpson has said financial support must be ‘tapered’ as businesses begin to reopen at reduced capacity so they can afford to pay staff. Under the scheme - known as furloughing - the government covers % of the wages of workers who are staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic and not working at all, up to a cap of pound, a month. googletag.cmd.push The Moviebowl houses a cinema, restaurant bar, bowling alley, cafeacute and children’s adventure playpark amongst other attractions. Mr Simpson employs around  staff -  in Derry - who have been furloughed during the crisis. At the weekend, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the Irish government’s roadmap to reopen society and business. The NI Executive is expected to outline its own pathway out of lockdown in the coming days. Once businesses reopen it will be on the basis of reduced capacity and strictly adhering to social distancing guidelines. In line with that guidance, staff will alsoto work in fewer numbers. Staff and customer safety is a matter of utmost importance, Mr Simpson said. googletag.cmd.push When the coronavirus first emerged bars in Derry led the way by announcing closures on March , including The Blackbird, Paedar O’Donnell’s and the Gweedore. The following day Brunswick Moviebowl decided to close its doors while encouraging its employees to use the time wisely to look after the most vulnerable during the pandemic. Brave decisions made by local businesses at that time have been widely praised and are believed to have saved lives. It was not until a full week later, March , that the British government officially ordered businesses to close under law. Mr Simpson said that with all the uncertainty at the time it was a ‘tough’ decision to make but he knew it was the right one. “It was tough, but people were ahead of the government because they just weren’t coming out at that stage. “That Sundaywe were empty. I think we did  lunches that Sunday and we’d normally do about . “It feels like a year ago already,” he said. Initially, the company had to pay staff but the announcement of a furlough scheme came as a relief. “We didn’t know how long it was going to go on. The big worry was how we were going to pay staff, everybody has bills. “But in fairness the furloughing scheme has been brilliant, that can’t be denied. And that took a lot of the pressure off.” ROADMAP The Irish government’s roadmap for reopening society and business sets out five phases with the first beginning on May  and the last on August . The Irish government’s plan states that cafeacutes and restaurants providing on-premises food and beverages can re-open at phase , June . They must comply with social distancing and strict cleaning protocols. Indoor recreational venues are set to reopen on August , where numbers can be limited, cleaning can be maintained, and social distancing can be complied with. The final phase is the one that is most applicable to Mr Simpson and Brunswick Moviebowl as that is when pubs, bowling alleys and cinemas can reopen in the south. Mr Simpson has welcomed the Irish government proposals saying ‘it looks fair enough’ and shows ‘light at the end of the tunnel’. “The biggest worry will be how theyend the furlough. If they suddenly say you can open on the th of August and everybody is off furloughed: with social distancing and other measures you’ll not be fit to bring back all the staff at the one time.” The Irish Government described its plan as a ‘phased flexible roadmap’ and said it has a ‘clear way of deciding’ when it can move from one phase of reopening to the next’ with a focus on minimising the number of people who get the infection, and the number of deaths as a result. In terms of that timeline, Mr Simpson said it will be a ‘numbers game’ and it will depend on how the numbers look at the time. “I think it could end up moving either way, backwards or forward,” he added. FURLOUGH There are concerns amongst restauranteurs that reopening with half the number of customers would not be profitable. Askedthat was a concern for the Moviebowl andhe envisages opening dferent parts of the building at dferent times, Mr Simpson said: “No, I think we would manage that.” He expects that once permitted to do so, the facility will open in its entirety with the exception of the Bananas Adventure Park as it would be impossible to ensure social distancing amongst young children. Mr Simpson is hopeful that the NI Executive will lay out its own roadmap soon as ‘everybody needs a bit of guidance’. “The biggest worry is looking after your staff and customers, and furloughing can’t just stop on a particular date because businesses won’t open up with the same number of staff until things go back to normal. “The furlough scheme needs to be tapered in some way so that it carries on. “We have  staff in Derry and you’re probably going to be opening with  or . And over the weeks and months you’d be taking them back gradually.” He concluded: “The Moviebowl will start out with reduced capacity and we’ll have to see how it goes from there.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His commitment to the community was steadfast and he is widely credited with rejuvenating the Kilrea, Rasharkin and Dunloy Credit Union, which was in danger of closing. John was a champion for the underdog, something he said was ‘second nature’ to him while growing up. When a young African student was due to be deported after her visa had run out, he took her into the family home and supported her in extending her stay for a further two years. He was dogged in his pursuit of justice for what he described as the ‘dreadful murder’ of Inga-Maria Hauser, the German backpacker whose body was found in a remote part of Ballypatrick Forest, near Ballycastle, Co Antrim. When the family announced they would no longer be ing to mark her anniversary, John took up the mantle of remembering her every year at the forest park. John held the post of Deputy Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly for ten years and also served on the Public Accounts Committee with what Colum Eastwood described as ‘forensic skill’. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money,” said the SDLP leader. “I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed.” Following his death, tributes were paid across the political spectrum. First Minister Arlene Foster said he was ‘always to the fore in speaking up for his constituents’. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill also expressed condolences, saying she was a ‘pleasant and witty man’, while Alliance leader Naomi Long said his death was a ‘genuine loss’. UUP MLA and Deputy Speaker Roy Beggs said he spoke for all the assembly when he said John would be ‘sorely missed’. Family was fiercely important to John and Fr Cargan told his funeral that, despite the pressures he encountered, he never allowed it to affect them. He said: “He encountered those who preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil. “These threats put his family le under immense strain and it is to his credit that he never allowed this pressure to diminish the equality of le enjoyed by the family.” John’s family said they had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the volume of the support they had received following his death. They said: “We would like to express sincere gratitude to the many people who have provided comfort to our family at this sad time. “We wish to thank the hundreds of local people who observed social distancing and lined the route of the funeral cortege to St Mary’s, Drumagarner, Kilrea. There are no words to adequately describe how moved we were. “These are unkind circumstances to lay anyone you love to rest but so many people made it a lot easier and more dignied than it could have been. “We have been overwhelmed at the volume of calls, messages, social media posts and touching tributes to him. We thank everyone for taking the time to express condolences and for sharing memories and anecdotes. “We are indebted to the dedicated healthcare workers. We will be eternally grateful to so many incredible people for their support, in particular, Ciara our amazing NI Hospice nurse, our GP Dr McCormack, consultants Dr Stewart  Dr Mullan from the NW Cancer Centre and Dr Diamond from the Mater. “Our selfless district nurses who provided craic as well as first-class treatment, the very appropriately named “carers” and the Marie Curie nurses. All of them somehow make each family in their care feel like they are their only priority. “He put up one of the bravest and most humbling fights, in much the same courageous, tenacious way that he lived his le. We are filled with pride at the number of people he has touched.” Described by Fr Cargan as a ‘man of light’, John Dallat’s determination and passion for helping others has left a lasting imprint on the community in East Derry and on all who knew him.

The well-known local politician died after a period of illness. Observing social distancing, many lined the roads leading to St Mary’s Church, Drumagarner as the cortege made its way into a church that parish priest John Cargan said should be full. Many of his party colleagues were not able to attend due to the Covid- regulations and instead posted tributes online. John was hugely admired and respected throughout the community in East Derry over the course of his -year political career. googletag.cmd.push He became the first nationalist mayor of the old Coleraine Council in  and won the respect of fellow councillors with his forthright determination. SDLP councillors on the current Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where his daughter Helena serves, expressed their sadness at his passing. They said: “We have been privileged to have John as our mentor and role model. John worked tirelessly for everyone in our community and fought for justice for many. “He was a well-respected politician with very strong values and will be sadly missed by each and every one of us. “Our thoughts and prayers go to our colleague Helena her mum Anne and brothers Ronan and Diarmuid and the wider family circle.” googletag.cmd.push A teacher by trade, he taught at St Paul’s College in Kilrea for  years before being elected to serve in the Northern Ireland Assembly in . His commitment to the community was steadfast and he is widely credited with rejuvenating the Kilrea, Rasharkin and Dunloy Credit Union, which was in danger of closing. John was a champion for the underdog, something he said was ‘second nature’ to him while growing up. When a young African student was due to be deported after her visa had run out, he took her into the family home and supported her in extending her stay for a further two years. He was dogged in his pursuit of justice for what he described as the ‘dreadful murder’ of Inga-Maria Hauser, the German backpacker whose body was found in a remote part of Ballypatrick Forest, near Ballycastle, Co Antrim. When the family announced they would no longer be ing to mark her anniversary, John took up the mantle of remembering her every year at the forest park. John held the post of Deputy Speaker in the Northern Ireland Assembly for ten years and also served on the Public Accounts Committee with what Colum Eastwood described as ‘forensic skill’. “As a public representative, John struck fear into the heart of anyone who dared misspend a penny of public money,” said the SDLP leader. “I know I speak for everyone in the party when I say his good humour and wise advice will be sorely missed.” Following his death, tributes were paid across the political spectrum.

Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill also expressed condolences, saying she was a ‘pleasant and witty man’, while Alliance leader Naomi Long said his death was a ‘genuine loss’.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

See Around Britain has built up a large gallery of photographs from venues across Britain, Ireland and Europe and is covering County Derry with the help of local volunteers. Chloeacute Taylor, who lives in Dungiven, is one of those who has been helping the service to improve accessibility to venues locally. “It allows people, especially those with an impairment, who might be worried about going out to go and view a place or go to a beach, or a library or museum,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “It gives them the descriptions and accessibility descriptions which is important in this day and age. It helps people that I know to go and get out of the house, and be more included. “I help with the social media side of things, producing content and bringing it to a wider audience. “I also help with venue descriptions for the website and take pictures of areas where I live and where I’m from. Originally from the West Midlands in England, Chloeacute has visited many places across the UK and Ireland, but things have slowed a little with the Covid- pandemic. She said: “Visiting places has become more dficult because you can’t really go too far with the requirements of the lockdown, but I am someone who takes a lot of pictures anyway. googletag.cmd.push “I have a lot saved from areas that I can use up and you can find the information quite easily, so it’s not a huge problem.” See Around Britain was formed in  by Marg McNiel, who has taken over , photos to help others with what to expect when they travel to a new venue. Marg suffers from Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, a neurological disease that affects all body systems and something he describes as feeling ‘constantly jetlagged’. The organisation is always on the lookout for more volunteers to increase their coverage of venues. “We have tried to do a comprehensive listing of Derry, not just the tourist sites,” he said. “We urgently need online volunteers that can sign up via our website. We think this will particularly help people during the current lockdown as they can use their talents or skills. “I aim to give skeleton coverage for more people to add to. It can include everyday things like pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, libraries, post offices and other shops. “Seeing is believing. It will help older people, people with impairments, or anyone really to know what to expect.” Much of the Marg’s early surveys were conducted from one of his three Morris Minor vans, which he admits are not in the best condition at the minute. “The last one had to be taken off the road in  because its chassis could no longer be patched to get it through an MOT,” he said. “There was nowhere to garage them undercover. The plan, as soon as we get them undercover, is to cut out the rust and replace it with steel  where necessary. “We want to convert them to electric motors because our present base is only rented and we plan to get a permanent base on a rural farm.” The vans will be used to ferry archives from the organisation’s current base when they source a new venue, but as with many projects, funding is proving to be an issue. He said: “We launched the website and its apps, which are free to download, in  and we’ve been building on it ever since. Each month it costs about pound,. “It’s hard getting revenue funding. You can get some through crowdfunding, but unless you’re like Captain Tom, it’s very hard. You have to have a high profile. “It’s very hard to get private sponsors, particularly because with the virus, most of the economy will be in deep recession. We’ve been trying to contact the actor Michael Sheen to help raise our profile. “Unless you provide something to help economic and social regeneration and we can play a vital role. “If people could see the worth of what we are doing, we could get a lot more volunteers and eventually, financial support.” “We’re trying to link up with an initiative in the Republic called Age Friendly Ireland. It was started by the former Chief Executive of Cavan County Council. “The Irish government has given funding for the Age Friendly Ireland offices in every county council as well as access and tourism officers. “We are trying to work with them to get a track record so we can go to the Ireland and Northern Ireland governments.” Volunteer Chloeacute also feels that the organisation could benefit so manyit received the right financial backing. “Disability also impacts on mental health and I definitely feel that government funding should be helping people to help others,” she said. “There is such a stigma surrounding disability and mental health, even now, and there shouldn’t be. Without See Around Britain, inclusivity for people would be reduced. “It helps improve the quality of their lives and help them realise that they can go to places with family and it helps them feel more included.” If you would like to become a volunteer for See Around Britain, or learn more about what they do, visit their website.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Executive announced it would match fund the British government’s investment therefore boosting the city region’s overall financial package to poundm. With additional funds leveraged from City Deal partners such as Ulster University and the private sector, it is anticipated that figure will rise to around poundm. Details of specic projects have been sparse, but it is known that Ulster University will receive at least poundm for centres in personalised medicine, data analytics, robotics and automation and a graduate entry medical school. googletag.cmd.push Now, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council has revealed that a riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration project will receive approximately poundm-poundm of the money. It is at a very early stage of concept design and as such, a budget for it can only be estimated. A council spokesperson said: “This project envisages the complete reconstruction of Queen’s Quay, the remodelling of Harbour Square and major environmental improvement works to Foyle Street and Foyle Embankment.” Other key projects fall under tourism, the combined funding earmarked for these plans at this stage is poundm-poundm. Although some of the tourism projects - such as the DNA Maritime experience in Ebrington - are much further advanced, other complementary tourism projects are again currently at concept stage only. googletag.cmd.push The council spokesperson added: “With regard to the riverfront and tourism projects, confirmation of the match funding for the Inclusive Future Fund has enabled us to progress with Strategic Outline Business Cases for the tourism and riverfront regeneration projects. “Council will continue over the coming weeks and months to progress with project planning and developing these business cases and engage with government and all stakeholders to understand the scale of resources and how we put them in place to facilitate the next stage of this exciting piece of work.” In addition to the riverfront and Foyle Street regeneration proposals, a council spokesperson also highlighted the siting of the medical school and future planned university expansion along the Quay. Initially, that will be limited to a site adjacent to the current city council offices but ultimately could include the city council offices with council relocating to the former City Hotel site on Foyle Street, adjacent to the Guildhall. Costs for all projects will y and be adjusted as business cases are developed and designs subsequently advanced and progressed. The council spokesperson added: “Again, as previously stated all of these plans are currently at concept stage only and are subject to business case development, affordability and approvals. “This very signicant and ambitious combined suite of integrated projects, together with the development of the centres of innovation in data analytics, robotics and automation and personalised medicine will transform the riverfront city centre, will act as a catalyst for further development and regeneration and will be a major investment in the health and well-being of our citizens.” Last week, the Derry News also revealed additional plans to regenerate Derrys quayside area. Plans have been put forward to construct a new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend the popular walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposals looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department.

The monthly Mayors tea dances at the Guildhall have been a highlight of their social calendar for many people in recent years. However, as with so many other events, the dances were cancelled because of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. While it will not be as a good as the real thing, an alternative tea dance will take place tomorrow afternoon. Mayor, Michaela Boyle, and her team are linking up with the Mark Patterson Show on Radio Foyle to create a special live virtual tea dance from pm to pm. googletag.cmd.push The show will feature music from local band Midnight Sun. Derry City and Strabane District Council will be providing a digital archive of some fascinating pieces from the Tower Museums Showbands Exhibition featuring old photos and stories from back in the day. There will be the opportunity to hear from someteadanceregulars, and listeners can phone in to share their stories and memories. Councillor Boyle said she was really looking forward to catching up with some of theteadanceregulars. Theteadancesare one of my favourite events and they have a dedicated following of lively members of the older generation who would put us all to shame with their energy and vitality. googletag.cmd.push This is a very dficult time for everyone – particularly older citizens – many of whom will be shielding at home, and perhaps feeling more isolated from family and friends. I wanted to do something positive to cheer people up by capturing some of the fun and memories from previous events, and reminding them that we will see ato normality and many moreteadancesto come.” BBC Radio Foyle ContentEditor Larry Deeney said they were delighted to be able to reach out through the show. The Mark Patterson programme draws listeners of every generation and when the council mentioned they were hoping to broadcast theteadancewe thought the show would be the perfect . “With social distancing measures in place, now people can enjoy theteadancesafely from their place of residence,he explained. “We hope theteadancehour will help reconnect some of the regularteadancersand allow people to share in some of the special memories from the event.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

the town.Superintendent Brendan McGuigan has appealed to local people not to react to rumour or innuendo and to ensure common-sense prevails at all times.The police chiefrsquos comments come after a second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have been wearing a grey sweatshirt and jeans at the time, made off with the keys of the manrsquos Peugeot car which he stole.The car has still not been traced and detectives investigating the incident

by writing to Syril Francey, CCNC secretariat at Hill Street in Belfast.The CCNC is an advisory body which advises the Department on matters affecting the natural beauty of Northern Ireland.Mrs

natural interest.BALLYHORNAN ndash A recent lucky escape for two stranded jet skiers off Ballyhornan coast has once again drawn attention to the need for safety precautions on local beaches.The pair, who spent more than half an hour in the water without wet suits or lejackets, were only saved by a quick thinking passer-by who raised the alarm and contacted the Coastguard.With incidents like this

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down.

He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since . I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my team-mates about that and you justhave to find little methods ad mechanisms to try and help yourself.Last Thursday, Ciara was one of a number of leading sportsmen and women at the virtual launch of Sport NIrsquos Wellbeing Hub in response to the COVID- challengeThe hub provides instant access to helpful information, guidance and screening that is tailored specically to help care for wellbeing needs.It offers a range of innovative tools and resources, including guided self-assessment via lsquoChatbotrsquo, self-help programmes and digital intervention tools, a searchable five ways to wellbeingrsquo map and a wellbeing information library.Ciara said: ldquoOur mental health is so vital and right now is a challenging time for all of us.A full-time athlete and a member of Team New Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all. We thank them for their generosity and I can assure them that the treats didnrsquot last too long.Mr Carabine said that the staff were coping with delivering items, mainly packages, and were as busy as they would be at Christmas mdash the busiest time of the year.ldquoI think the staff are coping admirably with the demand, as well as abiding by the two-metre social distancing rule in work. We have had to reorganise the office and stagger the earlier start times of some staff but they have all risen to the challenge.The Downpatrick office delivers throughout the wider Downpatrick area as far as Seaforde, Ardglass, Crossgar and Saintfield.Mr Carabine said: ldquoThe workers are more than holding their own in terms of maintaining deliveries and keeping themselves safe, although in some areas, due to the need to protect workers, the service is a bit later than usual..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Support.jpg","title":"Saintfield’s Leah battling to raise cash for charity  ","story":"A SAINTFIELD mum is throwing her weight behind a gruelling event to raise money for charity.Leah McCourt, a champion mixed martial arts fighter, is undergoing a test of strength and endurance challenge for Christian Aid, which is responding to the coronavirus crisis in some of the poorest countries in the world.Over five days, -year-old Leah will be attempt to complete , exercises carrying a weighted bag used by combat athletes to build strength.Starting on Monday, Leah will complete the daunting daily task of , squats and lunges while carrying on her shoulders the crescent-shaped lsquoBulgarian bagrsquo filled with  kilos of sand and wool.
