Entire schools could be shut, although the guidance suggests it will not \u0027generally be necessary\u0027. Unions warned they were not yet satisfied the reopening was safe, and demanded the government comes up with a \u0027Plan B\u0027 in case virus cases rise.But Mr Williamson told MPs that while he was constantly talking to unions, they could not \u0027dictate\u0027 policy, insisting \u0027education recovery is critical for this generation\u0027 and children must have the \u0027opportunity to thrive and fulfil their full potential\u0027.\u0027Returning to normal educational routines as quickly as possible is critical to our national recovery too,\u0027 he said.The curriculum taught must be \u0027broad and ambitious\u0027, but teachers are instructed to use \u0027flexibility\u0027 to prioritise the most important content that pupils have missed. Underlining the scale of the disruption faced by children, the advice concedes the curriculum might not be back to normal until summer next year. Under the new arrangements, primary schools will be able to operate \u0027bubbles\u0027 of more than 30 children, allowing the return of full classes.Secondary schools, where children move between classes, could operate \u0027whole year bubbles\u0027 of more than 200 children. Schooling will be made compulsory again, with parents facing £60 fines if they fail to send their children to school."},{"url":null,"title":"Dean Cain says cancel culture censored 1990s Superman character","story":"Share this articleWe\u0027re Reconsidering Cops on TV.

Thank God, the site is continuing its work as before.\u0027The site of the fire corresponds to a newly opened centrifuge production facility, said Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. He said he relied on satellite images and a state TV program on the facility to locate the building, which sits in Natanz\u0027s northwest corner.David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security similarly said the fire struck the production facility. His institute previously wrote a report on the new plant, identifying it from satellite pictures while it was under construction and later built.Iranian nuclear officials did not respond to a request for comment about the analysts\u0027 comments. However, any damage to the facility would be a major setback, said Hinz, who called the fire \u0027very, very suspicious.\u0027\u0027It would delay the advancement of the centrifuge technology quite a bit at Natanz,\u0027 Hinz said. \u0027Once you have done your research and development, you can´t undo that research and development. Targeting them would be very useful\u0027 for Iran\u0027s adversaries.Th site includes underground facilities buried under some 7.6 meters (25 feet) of concrete, which offers protection from airstrikes.Natanz, also known as the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant, is among the sites now monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency after Iran\u0027s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.The IAEA said in a statement it was aware of reports of the fire. \u0027We currently anticipate no impact on the IAEA´s safeguards verification activities,\u0027 the Vienna-based agency said.Located in Iran´s central Isfahan province, Natanz hosts the country´s main uranium enrichment facility. There, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium. Currently, the IAEA says Iran enriches uranium to about 4.5 per cent purity, above the terms of the nuclear deal, but far below weapons-grade levels of 90 per cent. It also has conducted tests on advanced centrifuges, according to the IAEA.However, Natanz did become a point of controversy last year as Iranian officials refused to allow an IAEA inspector into the facility in October after allegedly testing positive for suspected traces of explosive nitrates. Nitrates are a common fertilizer. However, when mixed with proper amounts of fuel, the material can become an explosive as powerful as TNT. Swab tests, common at airports and other secure facilities, can detect its presence on the skin or objects.Natanz also remains of particular concern to Tehran as it has been targeted for sabotage before. The Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to be an American and Israeli creation, disrupted and destroyed centrifuges at Natanz amid the height of Western concerns over Iran\u0027s nuclear program.Satellite photos show an explosion last Friday that rattled Iran´s capital came from an area in its eastern mountains that analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites. Iran has blamed the blast on a gas leak in what it describes a \u0027public area.\u0027Another explosion from a gas leak at a medical clinic in northern Tehran killed 19 people Tuesday.Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel´s Institute for National Security Studies and former Iran analyst for the prime minister\u0027s office, said he didn\u0027t know if there was an active sabotage campaign targeting Tehran. However, he said the series of explosions in Iran feel like \u0027more than a coincidence.\u0027\u0027Theoretically speaking, Israel, the U.S. and others have an interest to stop this Iran nuclear clock or at least show Iran there´s a price in going that way,\u0027 he said. \u0027If Iran won´t stop, we might see more accidents in Iran.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Polyamorous relationships legalized Massachusetts city","story":"Share this articleSomerville recognizes polyamorous relationships in new domestic partnership ordinance - The Boston Globe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4bb45976ed8cf9704d24c8cc11a284703206f01/391_350_4125_2474/master/4125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb76d84ccbd1934c0333284a8e1ab75e","title":"renaissance couple unhinged duo reunited after 125 years apart","story":"Separated portraits of 16th-century high society husband and wife finally back togetherA couple painted by the leading renaissance artist Bartholomäus Bruyn the Elder before their marriage in 1539 have finally been reunited after an art historian turned detective, spending two decades piecing together clues from across Europe to bring the two-panel portrait together again.Jakob and Elisabeth Omphalius, scions of high-society in 16th-century Cologne, had stared at each other for over 350 years from their respective wooden panels before being inexplicably separated during a sale at a London auction house in 1896.With their canvases unhinged, the portraits making up the diptych had gone their own way, and the identities of the man and woman already lost to memory by the time of the auction, appeared fated to be forgotten for ever.The mysterious young woman, with braids in her hair and a bittersweet sprig in her hands – two possible artistic signposts of an impending marriage – had ended up in the Rijksmuseum collection in Amsterdam in 1912 before being given on loan to the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague in 1951.The presence at the back of the painting of the coat of arms of Peter Bellinghausen, a professor of civil law in Cologne, suggested the woman was likely to be one of four daughters posing ahead of a marriage but no one knew where her intended might be found or indeed who he could be.It was only 20 years ago that the first vital clues emerged when Ariane van Suchtelen, curator at the Mauritshuis – a museum dedicated to the art of the Dutch Golden Age – discovered a catalogue of the London auction in the archives of the RKD – Netherlands Institute for Art History.There she found the sale records of a diptych misattributed as being by the Dutch painter Jan Gossaert but also sketches of the family arms of the featured couple which drew a link to the mysterious woman in the Mauritshuis.There was also an old photograph of the man’s portrait. Armed with that and the man’s family crest, Van Suchtelen went to the Cologne City Museum, where she found that the man’s coat of arms had belonged to Jakob Omphalius, a respected lawyer who become chancellor of his city in 1545.The city’s well-preserved civil records further revealed that Jakob had been married to Elisabeth Bellinghausen on 8 February 1539.But then the trail went cold. “At the auction they were separated, maybe to make more money – in the art trade you never know,” said Van Suchtelen. “The man was sold to an English dealer, Ralph Brocklebank, and the other portrait ended up in the collection of Cornelis Hoogendijk, who left it to Rijksmseum in 1912. So we had everything apart from Omphalius’s painting. I had to keep my eye open.”Records showed that the man’s painting had last been auctioned in 1955 but nothing had been seen of the piece since. It was not until May 2019 that Jakob reappeared as a “portrait of an unknown man” at a small auction house in Paris.The art collector Galerie De Jonckheere had bought the painting without knowing the identity of the person it featured. But when he put the painting on display in Geneva it was spotted by an art curator at a German museum as the portrait the Mauritshuis had been seeking.With the help of the Rembrandt Association, the Dutch lottery and a private donor, Omphalius’s portrait was purchased this year for €250,000 (£225,000). “And when you see them next to each other you see how well they go together – all the details go together very nicely,” said Van Suchtelen.Jakob is known to have studied in Utrecht, Paris and Toulouse before returning to Cologne to marry Elisabeth at the age of 39. She is believed to have been aged about 21 at the time of the portrait by Bruyn the Elder, a German master whose works appear in the National Gallery in London and the Louvre in Paris.The couple had 13 children, six of whom survived childhood. After Jakob’s death in 1567, at the age of 67, Elisabeth remarried and had a 14th child.“We had an obligation to reunite them,” Van Suchtelen said of her search. “For me it makes sense. I’m glad we had the patience for its reappearance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5da9191922b96932b8937be9b56ebc774e39602/0_315_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff01a5a066f55cce5adfdb5b589e6f0e","title":"daily life is deeply magical images from openwalls arles 2020 in pictures","story":"Supernatural grandmothers and a family of 13 living on a boat were among the subjects that caught the eye of the prestigious photography award’s judges"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b0a8604f1efcaeee58f79f7f005ff9d4bc7bd34/0_42_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ba02953e84681f8615b27c6e7534e5ae","title":"hong kong hsbc and standard chartered caught between us and china","story":"As US passes legislation targeting Chinese officials, banks face question of ‘which side their bread is buttered’ HSBC and Standard Chartered risk being caught up in the geopolitical struggle between the US and China after the US House of Representatives passed legislation targeting Chinese officials involved in implementing a national security law in Hong Kong.Banks who do business with officials involved in the security law could face sanctions, amid concerns the security law could be used to crack down on dissent in Hong Kong. More than 370 people were arrested in Hong Kong on Wednesday after the new powers were introduced.London-listed banks HSBC and Standard Chartered – which have significant operations in Hong Kong – have faced criticism from politicians including the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for publicly backing the introduction of the national security law.George Magnus, a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre, said the US legislation meant that the banks had been caught in a “terrible” position between the US and China.The national security law could open bankers and analysts in Hong Kong to prosecution, Magnus added, giving Beijing even more leverage over companies who operate in the territory.The US legislation passed unanimously. Under congressional rules the bill must return to the senate and be passed there before being sent to the White House for the president, Donald Trump, to sign into law or veto.Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing on Thursday that the US “must stop advancing the bill, let alone sign it or implement” it.Raab on Wednesday directly criticised the banks for putting profits ahead of the rights of Hong Kong’s citizens.“The rights and the freedoms and our responsibilities in this country to the people of Hong Kong should not be sacrificed on the altar of bankers’ bonuses,” Raab told parliament.It is understood the banks could face the scrutiny of MPs on the Treasury select committee, with at least one member planning to raise the issue. The banks have been criticised by large shareholders in the UK for backing the law, which has since been used to arrest protesters.Roland Bosch, of US-UK investment manager Federated Hermes, this week said: “We expect companies to support improvements in protections for citizens and not back their removal.”David Cumming, chief investment officer at investment manager Aviva, last month said he was “uneasy” about the banks’ statements and that he expected both HSBC and Standard Chartered to “confirm that they will also speak out publicly if there are any future abuses of democratic freedoms connected to this law”.HSBC and Standard Chartered declined to comment when asked about the arrests of protesters on Wednesday under the new law.Months of unrest in Hong Kong before the national security law may have already dented the territory’s reputation as a place to do business, according to an index by ZYen Group, which produces a twice-yearly index of financial centres. Hong Kong’s score and ranking on the index fell between September and March mainly because of less positive responses from financial professionals.Mike Wardle, ZYen’s head of indices, said: “While the financial market in Hong Kong is strong, any change which makes a financial centre less attractive as a place to live and work is likely to weaken its competitiveness, and may lead people and businesses to consider relocating.”Magnus said he expected the Hong Kong national security law would accelerate the “withering” of the territory’s status as a global financial centre as companies and workers grew more concerned about doing business there."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53e9e7ae12f8c8e729fa767e8c562ddaa3665c4e/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ff4ac8cd5342a5d9c3b7519f22700d","title":"why the secrecy around financial terms of covid 19 loan to celsa steel uk","story":"Rishi Sunak is right to help sector weather pandemic but needs to show Treasury is top of tree of creditorsCall it a small but significant step in the government’s Covid-19 business response: a loan has been granted to a company that does not meet the lending criteria for other support schemes.Celsa Steel UK, Spanish-owned but operating in south Wales, is the recipient. The sum is thought to be relatively small – about £30m – but 1,000 jobs were at risk. Chancellor Rishi Sunak seems to have decided the UK steel industry must not buckle during the pandemic.That’s the right policy, even if Celsa’s survival in the UK will offer little consolation to the thousands of workers losing their jobs in the retail, travel and hospitality sectors. Steel is genuinely different. A failure would have knock-on effects for the UK automotive, aerospace and defence sectors.There is a quibble, however. Why the secrecy around the financial terms of the loan?Soft conditions – restraints on executive pay, a demand to protect jobs and pursue net zero carbon targets – were mentioned. But we also need to know that the Treasury has inserted itself at the top of the tree of creditors, which is what a “last resort” rescuer of a strategic industry should do.One might say it matters little in the case of Celsa, but Tata Steel UK is also in line for a bespoke loan under the Project Birch scheme. That loan could be as much as £500m, and the financial terms would be highly important. If Sunak wishes to present himself as a hardball negotiator on behalf of taxpayers, he should provide the evidence.What counts as a low-risk share these days? One answer for some investors has been DS Smith – a low-profile member of the FTSE 100 index but one of Europe’s largest paper and packaging companies.A specialist in cardboard boxes ought to be a suitably dull and reliable stock to own during a pandemic, especially when e-commerce is enjoying a boost. What possible shocks could there be?Actually, though, chief executive Miles Roberts and his board have done the right thing. The history of stock market casualties is littered with companies that have over-distributed idends, hoping that risks won’t materialise, and come to rue their bravado. All too often, debt piles up, capital expenditure is cut, and problems compound.In DS Smith’s case, the net debt position of £2.1bn currently looks safe-ish when judged against last year’s earnings. But the figure is still slightly above the company’s target, which is why Roberts is right to fret about trading factors that could deteriorate.Income investors will hate such conservatism, but shouldn’t. The undistributed cash still belongs to them. Boardroom caution ahead of a (possibly deep) recession is justified – in fact, to be encouraged.Those queues outside Primark stores clearly weren’t just there for the buzz of reopening day. The fast-fashion retailer made a remarkable boast in its trading update: sales in its stores in England, in the week before last, were stronger than a year ago. That was despite the lack of tourists and commuters.The mistake, though, would be to draw wider lessons from the experience of a unique retailer. Primark doesn’t offer an online delivery service, so the pent-up demand factor will be stronger than elsewhere. The clothes are also as cheap as chips the punters know exactly what they’re getting and are loyal.So the Primark figure with real resonance is the one that pointed firmly downwards. The chain’s operating profits, reckons owner ABF, will arrive at £300m-£350m for the full year, versus £913m a year ago. If a two-thirds profits decline counts as a good-ish outcome for a retailing phenomenon, the financial pain for lesser rivals will be intense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ab1f66f0e51aede7b6cbc9782f0121d1f0842d0/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=346cc17762c1bc15b6d71c497da092aa","title":"labours real struggle left v right young and minority voters keir starmer","story":"Keir Starmer now has control of his party. But he risks alienating the very people Labour needs to embraceAs far as Labour is concerned, Keir Starmer is now master of all he surveys. A landslide victory among the party’s membership was accompanied by his appointment of the national executive committee’s general secretary, and with it control of the party machine. In the past two weeks, his removal of Rebecca Long-Bailey from the shadow cabinet and changes to NEC voting mechanisms have cemented the Starmer ascendancy. Commentators who spent years howling about Corbynite authoritarianism demand more: the left must not just be thrashed but humiliated in the process. A year ago, the headline above one Times commentator’s column was “Jeremy Corbyn’s intolerance makes him unfit to lead”. Two weeks ago it was “Keir Starmer should finish the purge of Corbynism”.As Starmer eyes the best ratings of an opposition leader since the mid-1990s and the party begins to shrink the polling gap, his team can seemingly afford to shrug off their internal opponents. If criticisms from within are framed as the left versus the leadership, that suits the latter’s outriders, who can dismiss them as the petulant howls of discredited losers.But in an age of political unpredictability and fluidity, complacency would be unwise: just ask Boris Johnson who, three months ago, headed the most popular government in a decade, with a net approval of +26 (it is now –9). Starmer’s emerging Achilles heel is not his demoralised internal leftwing opponents: it is younger people and minorities.When Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour deprived the Tories of a majority in 2017, the party won the highest support among the under-40s in any election, including Tony Blair’s landslide. It also repelled more pensioners than ever, and given they constitute a quarter of the electorate and are motivated to vote, Labour did not win that election. Even in the 2019 rout, Labour’s lead among the under-25s actually increased. While Corbyn had dire approval ratings in the overall population at the last election, he enjoyed net support among ethnic minority voters. There are important exceptions, of course – Jews worried about antisemitism and some British Indian voters affronted by Labour’s support for Kashmiri self-determination – but Corbyn’s long involvement with anti-racism struggles and close alliance with figures such as Diane Abbott led many minorities to conclude he was a natural ally.Defunding the police was never going to be part of Starmer’s policy package, but during a global uprising against systemic racism he could have taken a more constructive approach. He could have said he was not a spokesman for Black Lives Matter, that while he supported the police, reform was needed in a country in which most black people believe the police are institutionally racist. He could have pointed to the report put together by his own shadow justice secretary, David Lammy. He could also have championed investment in youth, social and mental health services, rather than relying on the justice system to deal with society’s ills.Younger people flocked to Corbyn’s Labour in unprecedented numbers for two reasons: first, their economic and social insecurity, from the housing crisis to student debt to low-paid work second, they felt their progressive social values were under assault. They have no ingrained loyalty or sentimentality towards the party. Otherwise politically disengaged young people post in support of Black Lives Matter. If the suited former director of public prosecutions wants to pick a fight with the Black Lives Matter movement young people will judge him harshly for it.That nearly two-thirds of black and minority ethnic voters have seen Labour as their champion is unsurprising: as well as an inherently racist justice system, nearly half of black African Caribbean households languish below the poverty line, andblack, Asian and minority ethnic workers are far more likely to have insecure work and to live in overcrowded homes. These are injustices that cannot be fixed with tinkering or with half-measures: only transformative policies can be considered genuine remedies.For those who want the party to remain committed to radical change, the battle lines should not be drawn as “left versus right”, but judged on whether Labour is abandoning the under-40s and minorities. True, Labour is emphatic it retains the pledge, for instance, to scrap tuition fees, although it refuses to commit to any manifesto policies. But when none of the party’s recent economic statements mentions the climate emergency, that should be judged as betraying younger people who will suffer the worst consequences of this existential crisis. When Starmer sits on the fence on trans rights, the leadership should be taught a lesson: that for younger people, LGBTQ rights are an article of faith. From housing to jobs to education to public services, a test must be applied: does the radicalism of Labour’s policies meet the scale of injustice facing younger and minority Britons.For those within the party, from Momentum to the soft left Open Labour, a coalition should be built to hold the leadership to the policy commitments Starmer made in his election: that is, after all, his mandate. But more importantly, extra-parliamentary movements such as Black Lives Matter can communicate a message that is impossible to ignore: the support of the under-40s and minorities is not unconditional, it has to be actively sought, and if they feel the party has abandoned them, they will respond accordingly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65e305cb26ace4b6fcdd10853a75c2876c0ff47b/414_1086_2827_1695/master/2827.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=7895c1f600949dc1db49d47e58b76055","title":"teachers and parents how do you feel about schools reopening","story":"We’d like to hear from parents and teachers about the government’s announcement that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full at the start of the next academic yearThe government have today announced that all schools and colleges in England will be reopening in full in September.Current limitations on the number of students that can be in school at once will be lifted, but schools will be expected to keep children in ‘bubbles’ according to their class or year group.

To April this year, the same CSO has so far discharged for 34 hours in 20 incidents.The area of wetlands in east London was created as part of the development of the Olympic Park. It was hailed as a legacy project to create a haven for plants, animals and insects for the public to enjoy.

On 30 September, untreated sewage was released into the wetlands for 49 hours. On 8 November, 90 hours of untreated sewage discharged from the overflow pipe. revealed this week that more than 1.5m hours of untreated sewage was discharged into English rivers last year via CSOs. The data, obtained under environmental information requests, gives the most comprehensive picture of the scale of sewage discharges the Environment Agency allows water companies to carry out.Theo Thomas, the founder of London Waterkeeper, said: “The Olympic Park is the biggest urban park built in a generation. It was meant to be a legacy project but 1,000 hours of sewage was spilled last year into the wetlands.“This is a public park and what is happening is unacceptable in 2020. It shows a callous disregard for public spaces and our environment.”Thomas is campaigning with Surfers Against Sewage for water companies to stop releasing untreated sewage into rivers.Hugo Tagholm of Surfers Against Sewage said: “The health of our rivers is inextricably linked to the health of our ocean. Polluted rivers will always lead to a polluted ocean. We need connected and thriving aquatic ecosystems, free from sewage and pollution.”Feargal Sharkey, the Undertones lead singer and a keen fly fisherman, said the Environment Agency was complicit in allowing the pollution of rivers through storm overflows.“They know perfectly well what is going on. They have known about it for decades and refused to properly deal with the situation,” he said.When the sewer system is operating normally, sewage leaves homes and businesses and is treated at a treatment works. Only when it has been treated is wastewater released to the environment, either out to sea through long outfalls or coastal discharges, or into rivers.The vast majority of England’s sewer network is a combined system, which dates back to Victorian engineering, and is designed to collect the contents of people’s toilets and surface rainwater then transfer them together to treatment plants.After extreme rainfall, the treatment works cannot cope with the volume of water and untreated sewage. Human excrement, condoms, sanitary towels and toilet paper are released untreated into rivers through combined sewer overflow pipes – just as it was in 19th-century London.These pipes are supposed to be a safety valve to release pressure in the system and used only when an exceptionally large amount of water enters the system.The release of untreated sewage and waste water is permitted in extraordinary circumstances – such as extreme rainfall – to relieve pressure in the system. But critics say the ’s data shows how routine sewage dumping in inland waters is.A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: “The sewage system is designed to overflow to relieve pressure on the system – discharges from CSOs are not a sign that the system is faulty or being misused.“However, when companies do damage the environment, whether it is through polluting our waters or breaching permit conditions, we will take enforcement action against them including civil sanctions.”Thames Water said: “We have invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills are made to the environment, and to better target investment in the best solutions.“Any discharge is undesirable but they only happen when there is literally no alternative and to prevent flooding to homes. It is the way the system is designed to operate.”• Statements from the water companies can be read in full here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac1d506c54ab30fc75927ebcd1f6f9943571e43b/0_234_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c3e00d4b7c736afc8a83c04041c8186","title":"juicy fruits 17 ways to cook with cherries from sorbet to vodka to black forest gateau","story":"Paired with chocolate for dessert or pickled and served over mackerel, there’s so much you can do with cherries this season – just invest in a stoner first As cherry season gets into full swing, allow me to recommend a small, but judicious, purchase – buy yourself a cherry stoner.You may already have one in a drawer somewhere – a tool you’ve inherited without ever knowing what it is: little sprung jaws featuring a spoon with a hole in it on one side and a corresponding protrusion on the other. You can pick one up for as little as three quid, and it does olives as well.If you haven’t got one of these and you’re faced with a recipe asking you to stone 500g of cherries, the most sensible course is to sit down, eat all the cherries and spit the stones out the window. This is, of course, the ultimate test of any cherry recipe: does it represent any sort of improvement on just eating cherries? If it’s close, a stoner may tip the balance.You can buy gadgets that stone six cherries at once, or machines that will stone a whole hopper full but, for a seasonal task like this, a little effort – a little ritual, even – is probably a good thing. It ought to take you a bit of time. There are other satisfactory methods, like this one using a bottle and a chopstick, but you may have to find the right bottleneck for your particular size of cherry. You can also manage the operation – messily – with a paperclip, should you find yourself cooking in an office setting.Nigel Slater’s recipes for cherry pie and cherry polenta cake are both good places to start – they’re straightforward and don’t ask too much of you. One of the difficulties of cherry season is that it arrives just at the point when the weather makes baking seem like a terrible idea. Chill your pastry dough that little bit longer, and find some shade to sit in while you wait.Cherry sorbet sounds an altogether cooler dessert, and Tamal Ray’s recipe requires only about 20 minutes over a hot stove. Better still, it has just three ingredients: cherries, sugar and white wine. Incidentally, if you’re going to end up with a puree, you don’t need to make a fuss about stoning the cherries. Just whack each one with the flat of a knife like you would a clove of garlic the stone will come away easily. Or, as Ray points out, you can cook the cherries whole and remove the stones once they’re soft.Clafoutis is a French dessert – whole cherries (stones left in, traditionally) baked in a batter until just set. Felicity Cloake’s perfect version contains almond essence and kirsch – a morello cherry liqueur which she describes as “ridiculously expensive”. Feel free to leave it out, along with the stones.Alternatively, you could invest in some kirsch for the season, since it is also called for in Liam Charles’s wholly nontraditional cherry bakewell custard tart. There is a lot going on in the name of this dish, but it is not unrelated to the clafoutis: cherries, almond essence and kirsch, baked in custard.This cherry galette also marries cherries and almonds – in this case via frangipane, the almond, flour, butter, sugar and egg paste that occupies a mysterious border realm somewhere between crust and filling. “Galette”, roughly translated, means “don’t worry – it’s supposed to look like that.” White spelt flour is recommended for the pastry, but it’s not a dealbreaker.Rachel Roddy’s cherry and ricotta tart has a latticed crust top with ricotta puffing out from underneath and a cherry filling below that. In Italy the cherries would be sour, but you can make this work with whatever sort you’ve got. The trick is to avoid overcooking the cherries – remove them with a slotted spoon before they turn mushy, reduce the remaining liquid to a syrup, and then put the cherries back in.Cherries and chocolate are another classic combination, most notably in black forest gateau, which is normally made with tinned black cherries, sometimes with the perverse addition of fresh cherries – stalks on – as a decoration. Dan Lepard uses fresh cherries to make the filling first. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall preserves the basic pairing in his cherry chocolate tart, which calls for yet more kirsch. It also requires you to be forward thinking enough to leave the cherries to infuse overnight.For sheer laid-back ease, I love the idea of a “broken cake”: basically any stale cake ripped up and tossed with cherry syrup, fresh fruit, cream or ricotta and other things. It’s hardly even a recipe, and it makes Eton mess look positively ordered.Fresh cherries may just be for summer, but they’re not just for pudding. They can make an appearance in salads, alongside rocket or goat’s cheese or both, with cucumber, basil and quinoa, or roasted, with buttermilk dressing and lettuce.This pickled-cherries recipe (Nigel Slater again – going through his back catalogue, you get the impression he really likes cherries) can be served over mackerel or gammon. And duck with cherry sauce is most definitely a thing. A seasonal glut and a greedy nature will invariably leave you with some less than perfect, slightly post-ripe fruit and the distinct feeling that you never want to look at another cherry again. This will not last, but in the meantime you can make enough jam to see you through the dark, cheerless, cherryless months. This is an easy method, but the jam sugar is not optional: cherries are low in pectin, so they won’t set by themselves. In contrast, this cherry and chia seed jam, from reader Rheanna Lucy Akua Griffin, has no sugar in it: just a little agave nectar or honey.Finally, when you have exhausted all other avenues, make this cherry vodka – absolutely no stoning required. Slit 400g of cherries, heat them with water and sugar until dissolved, cool, add a bottle of vodka, seal the mixture up and leave it for at least four weeks. It’s the poor man’s kirsch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8764da9b790a7aa8292519b203c70997ec9f906a/255_53_5207_3125/master/5207.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61701f869cbd7609182b7ce5cca42d0","title":"manchester city liverpool premier league match report","story":"Manchester City were superb on a night when Pep Guardiola and his players may have wondered how Liverpool could arrive as champions with a 23-point advantage.Pep Guardiola’s stance is that his side must prove itself each time it takes the field and his players walked the manager’s talk as they gave the still reigning European champions a schooling. Raheem Sterling was his team’s star, scoring while also creating the opener in what augurs nicely for City’s upcoming Champions League campaign.“Next season the manager said we need to go out here and try to do our best and that next season starts today and I think we did well,” the forward said.A smattering of City fans had “greeted” Liverpool’s coach with some choice invective ahead of a guard of honour from the team dethroned as champions by their visitors. Guardiola’s XI was strong – Ilkay Gündogan preferred over David or Bernardo Silva to partner the supreme Kevin De Bruyne in midfield. Klopp’s side were unchanged from one that trounced Crystal Palace 4-0.The contest had a sharpness. Sterling and Gabriel Jesus burst in behind Liverpool, while Sadio Mané was released by a cross-field Trent Alexander-Arnold ball. De Bruyne next fed Phil Foden, saw the latter foiled by Andrew Robertson, and when the ball came to the Belgian his shot crashed off the left-back.Moments later De Bruyne went down when challenged by Fabinho and Liverpool broke quickly. The move ended with Alexander-Arnold’s cross deserving better than a fluffed Mané header. Next up Benjamin Mendy was allowed space to swing in one of his curving deliveries: Liverpool’s rearguard were unable to block the ball, and breathed relief when Foden just failed to connect.Both sides’ ability to press is akin to a strangle of opponents and when Rodri moved forward only to be smothered by Georgino Wijnaldum on halfway here was a prime illustration. Now, Liverpool’s silky ability to create was displayed. Roberto Firmino’s no-look pass to Mohamed Salah was as admirable as the Egyptian’s glide across the edge of the D and the effort that beat Ederson but not the left post. The ball ricocheted to Mané but – again – he was clumsy and City escaped.What sounded like a volley of fireworks close to the stadium had punctuated the action and soon the game was marked by the opener. This was all about Sterling’s strength as he twisted and turned, forcing Joe Gomez into conceding a penalty. De Bruyne smashed this home and Liverpool were behind.They were soon staring at a 2-0 deficit. This was a strike of beauty from City, one of those hypnotic moves that removes their opposition as any kind of a factor. Mendy located Gündogan and he pinged the ball on to Jesus, whose pass to Foden found the wide-man on the right. Foden skated forward and played in Sterling who, after a first touch that left Gomez stranded, fired in for a 22nd in City colours this term.It was Sterling’s second goal against his former club, having also struck against them in the Community Shield, and next came a City third that was equally impressive. Rodri fed Foden and, as Robertson lunged, the ball was slipped to De Bruyne whose instant return had the 20-year-old Foden in: his right-foot finish gave Alisson no chance.Klopp changed the beleaguered Gomez for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at half-time, moving Fabinho to centre-back. Their 3-0 advantage meant City were surely conscious that Liverpool would come at them and in the hope of grabbing the goal that would give them a glimmer of a comeback.Instead Jesus had a chance to kill the visitors off when Alexander-Arnold took a throw-in straight to him yet while the No 9 brought the ball down neatly he then spooned the attempt. Liverpool were in disarray. Foden released Sterling and as the red shirts back-pedalled his effort needed a Fabinho block. Then, as Klopp watched on helpless, Gündogan’s vision allowed him to spy De Bruyne on the right. He looked up, saw Foden’s run and the latter’s shot this time required Virgil van Dijk to clear.

So it was that Mané was allowed through but he stepped over Jordan Henderson’s pass. Then Kyle Walker was booked for a foul on Mané but Alexander-Arnold’s free-kick was wide.Liverpool were rallying as would be expected yet now came the sucker punch from the irresistible Sterling. A sustained period of pressure from Klopp’s men was soaked up, City moved upfield, and his shot, which was heading wide, was inadvertently touched in by Oxlade-Chamberlain. On this form no one will relish facing Guardiola’s men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f920ff08ffe07ee2d5acab8d2dac4ff79df98e/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=397c74526e324baadc2d8dac8a2627c8","title":"sheffield united tottenham hotspur premier league match report","story":"José Mourinho rightly condemned the damage being done to “the beautiful game” by VAR but he has more to fear than the killjoys of Stockley Park on the evidence of Tottenham’s defeat at Sheffield United. Mentally, defensively and creatively, Spurs were second best and are in danger of finishing outside the top six for the first time since 2009.Mourinho attacked the VAR decision that disallowed an equaliser for Harry Kane at Bramall Lane, naturally, but he did not camouflage its impact on his brittle players. Spurs lost their composure and fight after Michael Oliver’s decision and were sliced apart by Chris Wilder’s wing‑backs as United leap-frogged the visitors in the pursuit of European qualification. All three of United’s goals came from the flanks and on all three occasions the Spurs defence was found wanting badly. Oli McBurnie, who sealed victory, embodied the heart and commitment that his opponents lacked.“We have to be mentally stronger to cope with what happened during the game,” Mourinho said. “We cannot mentally die after Michael Oliver gives a decision. I know it is very difficult to take but we have to be stronger. I know more about the profile of my players now and at half-time I feared we wouldn’t be strong enough to cope in the second half.”United had toiled since the season restart, scoring only once in four games without a win, but this was a solid return to pre-lockdown form. There was urgency and aggression to the hosts’ attacking play from the first whistle, allied to a disciplined defensive shape and fierce work ethic that also underpinned the improvement. Were these not once the hallmarks of a Mourinho team?An incident-free contest sparked into life when United took the lead with a well-worked team goal that flowed from left to right through Enda Stevens. George Baldock released Chris Basham and set himself for a shot when the defender returned the ball invitingly from the by-line. Sander Berge collected instead, to Baldock’s obvious annoyance, but spared himself a rollicking from his teammate by finding the far corner of Hugo Lloris’s goal with a precise drive. It was the club-record signing’s first goal in English football since his £22m arrival from Genk in January.Berge’s celebrations had only just ceased when Spurs levelled through Kane. Or so everyone thought. The visiting captain beat Dean Henderson after picking up a loose ball off Lucas Moura and cutting inside Basham. The ball had cannoned off Moura when, having been fouled while running at the United defence, John Egan’s clearance struck the forward as he hit the ground. Moura’s arm touched the ball as he fell and VAR’s draconian rules meant the goal was disallowed.Mourinho said: “I never complain to the man with the whistle because he is not the referee any more. I used to complain but now the man on the pitch is the assistant referee and today the man and lady with the flags are the assistant of the assistant referees. The referee is in the office. And when the referee is not good on the pitch you can’t expect them to be good in the office. We are going in a really bad direction for the beautiful game everyone fell in love with.”Oliver Norwood was fortunate to avoid a second yellow card when he caught Son Heung-min with an elbow, moments after picking up his first booking and having made little attempt to play the ball. Spurs’ evening deteriorated thereafter.The visitors lacked ingenuity to disrupt United’s defensive shape and concentration to prevent Wilder’s team extending their lead. The Blades’ second stemmed from the tireless efforts of McBurnie. The striker worked the ball out to Stevens and he combined superbly with Ben Osborn, who capped his first Premier League start with a fine reverse touch to the left wing-back. Stevens had time and space to pick out Lys Mousset and the substitute striker, left completely unmarked by the sleeping Eric Dier and Ben Davies, tapped home. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200702-55761-gnl.fw.20200702.ds.fw0207.mp3 McBurnie received his reward with the third. Spurs were again undone by a marauding wing-back, this time Baldock on the right. He released Berge inside the area with a cheeky flick and the midfielder centred low for McBurnie to turn the ball past Lloris from close range.The visitors were defensively weak once more, McBurnie stealing in ahead of Davinson Sánchez after being left by Erik Lamela. Kane’s 90th-minute tap-in from Son’s cross meant the England captain has now scored against all 29 Premier League teams he has faced. He will not dwell on the consolation for long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a499ad7078b2bad3f6fbd269b99dca16213b22f/5_139_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37a4f72757b361433473d7449a367d58","title":"manchester city v liverpool premier league live","story":"Raheem Sterling, Phil Foden and Kevin De Bruyne were outstanding against a lacklustre Liverpool side that missed chances early onHe says he’s particularly pleased because it was clear Liverpool did not take this match lightly. “I saw how focused they are. Even in the guard of honour, they were focused. They did not even say thank you.” Then the manager shows irritation at the line of questioning, seemingly convinced that Sky’s man is trying to get him to criticise his team’s attitude. The questions were imprecise but not provocative, except in these sense that imprecise questions from journalists are annoying: but Klopp’s irritation has more to do with the tonking his team just got. But he maintains that his team were full of fight. Sure, but they were also very sloppy. “If you want to lead this story in the direction that we were not focused on this game, then do it,” says Klopp.” “We know we’ve got the FA Cup and Champions League. In the Premier League games coming up we need to finish strong and that will only help us in the other competition.”City win this skirmish after Liverpool have already settled the campaign. In that sense, what happened here today doesn’t matter. But Liverpool will be at least slightly miffed at being dismantled by their nearest rivals, especially as they contributed to their own defeat with some uncharacteristically shambolic defending Gomez and Robertson were all over the shop, and Mané and Firmino were ragged up front. City were technically excellent at times, with De Bruyne, Sterling and Foden all excellent and Rodri a constant influence. It’ll be interesting to see how Liverpool react to this: shrug it off and let the rest of the season fizzle out? Or come back and annihilate poor old Aston Villa on Sunday? There’ll be personnel changes for that game, I’ll wager.NO GOAL! Mahrez fires in at the near post after a lovely interchange with Foden, but he handled the ball in the build so the goal doesn’t cont. 90 min: There will be at least four more minutes before Liverpool can return to the dance piste.88 min: Mendy cuts out a cross by Oxlade-Chamberlain at the expense of a corner. Robertson swings it over. Ederson palms it away, and City sweep forward on another counter-attack. The indefatigable Henderson charges back to snuff it out. 86 min: Silva catches Williams late as the defender whacked the ball clear. 81 min: De Bruyne orchestrates another attack, feeding Mahrez at the edge of the area. The Algeria international shows quick feet to make space for a shot and then drills a low effort wide from 18 yards.79 min: Man City substitution: Otamendi and Bernardo Silva on, Sterling and Laporte off.78 min: Keita holds back De Bruyne in midfield to curb another City attack.77 min: Salah opens his body and curls a shot around Laporte and towards the far corner. But Ederson is wise to it and makes a comfortable save.75 min: Laporte and Mendy take turns clearing dangerous crosses.74 min: Klopp must have had an angry word during that break. Liverpool are playing as if their pride is hurt. They’re trying to salvage a goal at least.69 min: Liverpool are strolling now. Which, incidentally, can be a good way to ease your way out of a hangover “Although frustrating to watch as a Liverpool fan, this is the only acceptable way for a team to respond to having to give a guard of honour to your rivals,” honks Matt Dony. “I think I would have turned down the guard, for fear of a subsequent case of the hubrises.” Maybe to offset that, Liverpool should give City a guard of honour on the way off? Set them right for next season.Liverpool opened up easily again. Rodri sprays a pass to De Bruyne in plenty of space mid-way inside the Liverpool half. The Belgian weighed up his options before sliding in Sterling, who sidestepped Robertson and slotted a low shot past Alisson. Oxlade-Chamberlain slides it to try to clear it but only helps it into the net. And the replay shows that the ball was, in fact, heading wide. So thats an own goal. It’s been that kind of night for Liverpool.65 min: A crisp ball from mid-way inside the City half finds Salah near the penalty spot with his back to goal. He flips it off to Origi coming in from the left. Laporte gets in the way of the forward’s first-time shot.63 min: Liverpool substitutions: Origi and Keita on, Wijnaldum and Firmino off. Firmino has looked particularly knackered today.60 min: Laporte gives the ball away at the back. Mané retrieves at the edge of the area and slides it to Firmino, whose shot from the centre is blocked. This game fluctuates between spells of high class and outbreaks of mass sloppiness. 57 min: Two Liverpool players stand at the end of the City wall ... but they forget to get out of the way when Alexander-Arnold shoots: so the shot deflects off Henderson and goes wide.56 min: After a VAR review, Liverpool do not get a penalty: instead it’s a freekick at the edge of the area following a foul by Walker...54 min: A mistake by Garcia gifts the ball to Henderson, who looks up and slots a pass through to Mane, who’s free 15 yards out .... and he somehow steps over the ball! All he had to do was shoot on sight, but instead he performed some kind of dance move: Liverpool still in party mode, you say? “City are still in two competitions,” notes Sam Baker. “They are actually holding back here.” Or, to put it another way, they’re turning on the style when it doesn’t matter?52 min: De Bruyne romps down the right in loads of space, then measures out a low pass to Foden, who guides it past the keeper. But it’s not the cleanest connection so Van Dijk is able to hook it clear from in front of his own goal.51 min: Sterling scurries towards the box as City stream through Liverpool again. He opens fire from 18 yards. Fabinho hurls himself in front o it to deflect it wide.49 min: Liverpool are still asleep at the back. Alexander-Arnold flings a throw-in straight to Jesus, who wriggles towards the box and fires off a shot that forces a save from Alisson.48 min: Corner to City. De Bruyne curls it in, Alisson makes an easy catch.46 min: Gomez’s ordeal is over: he’s been hauled off and replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain. Presumably that means Fabinho will drop back into defence.So who thinks this is unfolding in a good way for Aston Villa? They face Liverpool at the at weekend in dire need of points to avoid relegation. Will they meet a rabble? Will Klopp make lots of changes? That depends partly on how the second half goes here...So, about that inbox: no irate fans are suggesting Klopp is a fraud who has been exposed. Instead, it seems sense is common, after all. “Liverpool won the league in 1983 with six games to go and didn’t win any of the last six,” recalls Jim Morrish. “The team were already (mentally) on the beach. They still won the league in 1984 ..... and the European Cup..... and the League Cup.” I’m going for a, ahem, drinks break. Will be disappointed if, by the time I get back, there aren’t at least a few mails in my inbox saying Klopp has taken Liverpool as far as I he can?Liverpool started well and should have taken the lead but once Sterling began tormenting Gomez, the champions crumbled like lads who’ve been on the razz for days. Uncharacteristic sloppiness has made them easy prey for City, who added two slick goals after De Bruyne’s penalty. Klopp will understand but not accept this, at least not right now.45+2 min: Good tackle by Garcia on Firmino. But Liverpool recycle the ball and work it to Salah in a dangerous position. From the right-hand byline he drops a cross at he back post. But there’s no one there.Robertson loses the run of himself and runs into a challenge he can never win with Foden, who sees him coming and lays the ball off quickly to De Bruyne and then spins and darts into the box to collect the instant return pass. And then he sweeps it high past Alisson for an impeccable finish from 15 yards.

I just turned to him and tried to will him to leave with my eyes – and then he demanded a biscuit. Of course, I said yes.”As the broadcast cut abruptly away from Haynes, the Sky News anchor Mark Austin said: “We will leave Deborah Haynes in full flow there with some family duties, but that’s what is happening during lockdown and trying to report during lockdown.”Some described his reaction as “rude” and suggested the interview should have continued, but Haynes said the decision would have been made in the studio rather than by Austin, and she was relieved to be off screen. Austin tweeted later that he was “was keen to stay with it and find out which was the biscuit of choice … but international affairs beckoned.”Sky News’s reaction was compared unfavourably with that of the BBC’s Christian Fraser, who – on the same day – continued a conversation with Dr Clare Wenham, an assistant professor in global health policy at the London School of Economics, when her four-year-old daughter entered the room.Wenham continued talking for more than a minute about the issues of getting access to coronavirus testing data, while Scarlett – who has also featured in a UN executive board meeting – continued to try to get her attention, eventually climbing on the desk and waving her artwork.Wenham said she was “mortified”, but added: “Every working parent is having similar things happen. I’m not a hippy, liberal parent but I also think we are not in Victorian times and I don’t believe children should be seen and not heard.”She said seeing parents juggling their work and family life could become a permanent feature, with the childcare sector on the “brink of falling apart”.“If seeing something like this on screen makes employers realise that people have lives and are constantly juggling and need flexible working practices, it has to be a positive.”Haynes said she and Wenham had been in touch after their children’s on-screen appearances. “It was like we were in it together,” she said. “There was a sense of solidarity and we were both pleased it was seen as a positive thing about parenting in lockdown.”Mandu Reid, the leader of the Women’s Equality party, said both women had managed the incidents with grace and good humour. “This has no doubt been a feature of their working lives since the beginning of lockdown, along with millions of working women who’ve picked up the lioness’s share of domestic work, homeschooling and childcare,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cd97cd670a6d29ae71186df062a962fe5145ab/3176_877_2449_1470/master/2449.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc2e0e96084b84a5690bf1aa07b53bd4","title":"socially distanced venetian gondolas rufus wainwright on his dream festival","story":"With festival season cancelled, we’re starting a new series asking stars for their dream lineups. First up is Rufus Wainwright, blending opera and Florence WelchI am a big fan of Venice and my husband and I have spent quite a bit of time there. Even when it’s teeming with tourists – which it won’t be now – I find it gloriously enthralling, so my festival would simply have to be there. Everyone would ride gondolas so we’d all be socially distanced and there would be a beautiful band show on one of the islands. It would be kinda like going to a drive-in, but a boat-in.For my headliners, Florence + the Machine would fit well with the opera. Florence Welch isn’t just a fantastic performer, she also has an operatic flair. I saw her once at the Hollywood Bowl and it was one of the greatest shows I’ve ever seen in my life. I was blown away.Things would start early in the morning with the first act of Tosca, delivered by the Teatro La Fenice. After the first act we’d have a folk acoustic set, then Martha Wainwright. Watching my sister is a triple-edged sword. On one hand I’m overwhelmed by love – she’s probably my closest relative and we started off performing together. The singer in me can be competitive, but I’m a big fan and it’s nice to just sit down and enjoy her music as a fellow human being. Father John Misty would be next because I’d be looking for performers who really know how to command a stage. Björk is almost creating her own opera-like existence with art and costumes. She’s highly influenced by the sorcery of the stage and she herself is kind of a legendary operatic character. As the day goes on, Perfume Genius would be a perfect sunset artist. He’s very playful and humorous, which is not as common as one might think. By now, people are pretty inebriated and ready to let loose, so I’d bring out the DJs, maybe Mark Ronson and Kid Koala. There would be serious lifeboats in case anyone fell off their boat. I like legacy acts so Neil Young would be fun. Sigur Rós. Oh and Lizzo … and Beyoncé! It’s my dream festival, right? So money is no object.I envisage a one-day event – you’re not going to spend a weekend on a gondola. But it would be good if people could swim. I imagine the water is a lot cleaner now, because of lockdown.I’m not sure a stand would work with gondolas, but being in Italy you would have the most amazing Italian food shuttled over to the boats. So I’d imagine an elaborate breakfast, lunch and dinner, pasta and ravioli, all washed down with wine during the opera sections.

Flag waving and singing along in your front room will be encouraged.Organisers of the world’s biggest classical music festival on Friday released details for what will be the 125th anniversary year of summer concerts and likely the strangest season in its history.Before the fortnight of live proms there will be six weeks of “fantasy proms” from the archives broadcast on BBC Four, Radio 3 and iPlayer.Live and audience-free proms begin on 28 August and will feature each of the BBC orchestras. Sakari Oramo will conduct the opening live concert while the Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska will be on last night duties.The last night will also feature the South African soprano Golda Schultz and a newly commissioned work by Swedish composer Andrea Torrodi which responds to the pandemic and will include sounds from the lockdown.It will be strange having an empty hall but BBC Proms director David Pickard hopes people will get into the last night spirit from their homes. “The last night has to be a celebration and coming together of the nation,” he said. “We will obviously have to think carefully about how we do that but also – how do we reflect on what everyone has lived through in the previous six months?”Other live highlights will include a recital by cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason and his pianist sister Isata Kanneh-Mason pianist Mitsuko Uchida performing with the London Symphony Orchestra under Sir Simon Rattle and violinists Nicola Benedetti and Alina Ibragimova with the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.Physical distancing will inevitably affect the programme and orchestra sizes, said Pickard. “We have to be practical, which means we’re talking of orchestras Mozart and Beethoven size rather than Mahler and Shostakovich size. That’s just a fact.”But there were many positives to be found from restrictions. “There is a lot of fantastic baroque, classical, early romantic music out there that we can do and I hope that the two weeks will still feel like the Proms, with new work and plenty of variety and interesting pieces people might not know.”What there will not be is canned applause or cheers. “I think there are ways we can make wonderful pieces of television and radio without having to do that.”The opening weekend will feature the lockdown-assembled ‘BBC Grand Virtual Orchestra’ with 350 musicians performing an original arrangement of Beethoven’s nine symphonies by Iain Farrington.Proms from the archives will include the celebrated 2007 debut of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela conducted by Gustavo Dudamel. There will also be the first TV showing of the Radio 1 Ibiza Prom from 2015 featuring Pete Tong and John Newman.BBC Proms organisers have purposefully waited until the last possible moment before giving details of the season, hoping that there would be a chance of live performance. “There was a time in April when it felt like all the arts festivals were collapsing around us,” said Pickard. “We had to hold on to hope that we could do something in September.”He said the single most important reason for doing live performance was to support the revival of live music-making. “Freelancers in the arts world are going through an absolutely horrendous time. This isn’t going to turn their lives around … but I hope it points to a more positive future and gives some support to a sector that has been under so much stress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb10c0f998e7d48942fa1603ebcf0dc07ce008c1/0_267_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8aee839c9bf2ee7b47d77ef07359d5a2","title":"lockdown easing why the uk is better prepared for a second wave","story":"This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors. ’s heath editor, Sarah Boseley, looks at whether another lifting of restrictions might result in a second wave, and if it does, why we are better prepared this time round From this Saturday, the government has said that in England, pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will be able to reopen, two households will be able to meet in any setting with physical distancing measures, and people can enjoy staycations with the reopening of accommodation sites. But with the loosening of restrictions comes fears of a second wave.

I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

But anyone hoping to pop in and browse the bookshelves, take their child to rhymetime or spend a couple of hours using the computers is going to be disappointed.“We have the capacity for 20 people at a time,” says Rachel Braithwaite, project development manager at the Archibald Corbett Library in south London, which will, unlike many other libraries, be opening its doors from 4 July and restarting at least some former activities. “There will be a space marshall and hand sanitiser at the door. Everyone feels differently. People who would be worried won’t come. But personally I’m looking forward to it.”Returned books will be put into crates and quarantined for 72 hours. As for browsing, there may be a system whereby any books that have been touched and not borrowed have to go into quarantine it’s still to be decided. But the system to check books out is in place: librarians will be behind perspex screens, through which library cards can be scanned.During lockdown online library services have been booming, but it’s also important, says Braithwaite, to offer more than online services. For the past three weeks, the library has provided a click and collect service – and only one book order has so far been put in. “A lot of our customers are people without access to computers. If we do things like click and collect, or online activities, that won’t reach them,” she explains. “We want people to come in and get books.”Community services will also be available, including helping people without digital access fill in online forms for benefits such as bus passes or universal credit. “We’ve already started those services, out at the back of the library, on the decking. We now plan to move that into a room, with distancing and personal protective equipment,” says Braithwaite. Classes in English for speakers of other languages will also restart, and there will be access to four of the library’s usual nine PCs.Over the past 10 years of austerity, libraries have become vital community hubs, agrees councillor James Lewis, deputy leader of Leeds city council. “We have put a lot more services into libraries – credit unions, job shops, even post offices,” he says. Of the 34 libraries in and around Leeds, six will initially reopen, but there will be no book browsing. Computers will be available, but will have to be booked for 45-minute sessions. Even this limited amount of reopening has taken “painstaking” work, he says.As they gradually reopen, all UK libraries will have to put strict measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and users, including physical distancing and measures such as booking computers in advance. Dates vary around the UK. Libraries in England are able to reopen from 4 July libraries in Scotland from 15 July and in Northern Ireland from 20 July. In Wales, the next review of lockdown measures will be on 13 July until then, some libraries already offer a click and collect service and many are planning how to reopen with limited services.In most areas, it’s the larger libraries, more easily able to provide physical distancing, that are reopening first. In Nottinghamshire, for instance, library spaces have been reorganised with no access to study space, toilets, refreshment areas and no activities.“A lot of us realise that the services we are used to will only come back gradually,” says Portsmouth councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, who chairs the culture, tourism and sport committee of the Local Government Association. Many library staff have kept in touch with their users, particularly older and more vulnerable residents, but not everyone will know the new rules. “For some people, that message won’t get to them until they go to the library and talk to staff,” he acknowledges. “There will be teething issues, but I expect people will be OK when things are explained to them.”Lewis agrees. “Trying to get back safely the places where people get together, like libraries, sports centres, museums and galleries, is really frustrating. There’s been nothing like this in anyone’s lifetime, so we didn’t expect government to figure it out to the last penny,” he says. “But we don’t see any extra money. We are already starting the process of service reviews to reduce spending, including potential compulsory redundancies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d6a746fe290b01dab8075661b95edb2b8b3b5ae/1_0_2416_1451/master/2416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d5b606a13059f2c65b0543fafb74349","title":"life in the amber zone a view of project restart","story":" photographer  Tom Jenkins has documented the Premier League since its restart in June. Here, he looks back on the experience of shooting matches in empty grounds amid strict Covid-19 precautionsClick on each image for more informationThat bloody bird has been putting me off all game. High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football. Welcome to the world of Project Restart, the Covid-19 version of the Premier League.For the last two weeks I have been lucky enough to be one of the chosen few to be let in to see the resumption of top-class football in England. When normally I could be one of between 20 to 50 photographers attending these matches, now it’s just a maximum of 10. Current rules state there must be no more than 300 people inside the ground at any one time.My first game back was the one that launched the resumption, at Aston Villa as they faced Sheffield United. All attendees at matches are required to have a temperature check before accreditation is given. In a building in the main car park I’m stood on a designated spot and look at a screen, like a high-tech speak-your-weight machine. This equipment deems me safe and my pass is handed over. Rumour has it that Manchester City have splashed out on an even flashier thermometerand a scanner operated by a real nurse. At the other grounds I’ve subsequently been to, the temperature check is performed with a little white plastic gun to the forehead. At Spurs, before their game v West Ham, it’s boiling hot. To make matters worse the man with the gun is waiting at the top of a flight of stairs and I’m carrying a ton of gear up there. My fingers are crossed as the gun points at my red, sweaty temple.Every ground is ided into three zones: green, amber and red. Roughly speaking, green is the immediate vicinity outside the stadium, amber inside the ground, red on the pitch and the tunnel area. Only players and club officials, those who are regularly tested, get into the red zone. I am amber. Before every game I’m sent a health declaration form to sign along with safety protocols to read. These vary enormously from club to club but the most substantial and well organised is definitely Liverpool’s, courtesy of their safety officer, Mr Stan Tickle.As I go into the first match at Villa, I look up at a big screen. “Face coverings must be worn at all times” it declares. I’m led to my allotted spot by a couple of kind, middle-aged stewards who are wearing their claret and blue masks as chin warmers. “You can’t move from there” they tell me “and you must wear your mask at all times”. “No problem,” I say as Jamie Redknapp brushes past me looking very dapper in a navy suit but mask-free. A member of ground-staff comes to disinfect the corner flag near me. As I pick up my camera, he is told by a colleague “put your mask on properly, you’re having your picture taken”.The atmosphere inside all the grounds is very strange and eerie. These are stadia I know so well yet it all seems unfamiliar. It’s a real sensory scramble, not only visually but also aurally. I was at Goodison Park for the Everton v Liverpool match, sat in the front row of the Gwladys Street End. Normally a febrile atmosphere emanates from the home fans in that stand, scorn pouring down on anything red. Around me this time are acres of tarpaulin sheets adorned with faces of the Everton faithful. A couple of metres away sits John Powell, Liverpool’s official photographer. “Lovely isn’t it?” he jokes.With 10 minutes left, and the game tied 0-0, Tom Davies hits the inside of the post and Everton are denied a famous winner. It is such a dramatic moment but all I can hear, apart from a couple of expletives from players, are the mellow tunes of a jazz saxophonist playing Baker Street by Gerry Rafferty from outside the ground. After a few matches I start to get used to the noise of these games. You can hear everything the players, coaches and referees say – it’s quite illuminating. There is so much shouting from the players I begin to wonder how they have the energy to run around. It takes me back to park football, refreshing to hear that multi-millionaires can still say such well-known football phrases as “Man on”, “Push Up”, “Keeper’s ball” or “Pull your finger out” although the last one did include a swear word as well.It’s fascinating to see how clubs have adapted to the rules laid down by the Premier League and government health advisers. Goodison Park’s notoriously tight tunnel means the away team change in a portable building in the car park, while at Tottenham the home team have shifted their changing room to the other side of the ground where the huge, expansive NFL rooms are situated. It’s also meant a lot more work for ground-staff, as they have disinfecting duties with balls, corner flags and goalposts.At Norwich they have an old-fashioned bucket of Dettol to drop balls into, while at Spurs they have armed their staff with Ghostbusters-style backpacks to spray down the posts. Even with all these safety requirements, things can go slightly awry. I was at Watford, positioned near the sideline where the substitutes were warming up. In the stand behind the dugouts the subs had carefully distanced seats to sit in, but as they started to stretch their limbs they gathered in a tight bunch, completely blocking my view of the game. One Watford player put his leg onto the board right by my camera, looked at me in my mask a couple of feet away, realised he was far too close to an amber zone non-tester, and moved away sharpish. After talking to his fellow subs, they all scarpered giving me a lovely clear view again.At Anfield last week, just after Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold arched that beautiful free-kick into the top of the Crystal Palace net, I could clearly hear a commentator eagerly describing the goal, even though he was high up in the Centenary Stand, probably a hundred yards away. It made me think what that stadium would have been like if the crowd had been there and I felt sad for them, deprived of seeing a moment like that in the flesh.I hope that before too long they will back and that the abnormality of behind-closed-doors football will soon be consigned to history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4628d48a9bb3cb00fb5f7358bc73d4c39fd4621f/454_710_2960_1775/master/2960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db16747241e3fb63964cd76004fa6b8e","title":"manu tuilagi can make claim against leicester for compensation says lawyer","story":"Manu Tuilagi can make a straightforward claim against Leicester for compensation and damages after he was stood down by the club, according to a leading sports lawyer – aiding the England centre’s chances of continuing his international career.Tuilagi’s time at Leicester is in effect over after he was among the players who did not accept a reduced contract before the club’s imposed deadline this week. The 29-year-old has already been linked with a move to France but doing so would halt his England career given the Rugby Football Union’s refusal to pick players based abroad. In addition, the Top 14 is exploring a reduction in its €11.3m salary cap, meaning Tuilagi’s wages of around £500,000 a year are more of a stumbling block.Matching those wages is all the more difficult for the cash-strapped Premiership clubs but Tuilagi could walk away from his Leicester contract and make a claim for compensation from the club for any shortfall in earnings. In other words, if he were to agree a cut-price deal of £300,000 at another Premiership club, the shortfall of around £200,000 would be made up by the Tigers, assuming his claim was successful.“Or the players can accept the breach, walk out of the club and then they are free to join any other club they wish with a duty to mitigate their loss. And then if there’s a financial shortfall the players can make a claim for compensation.”Cramer also believes that Tuilagi and co could potentially make claims for reputational damage if they could show they have been portrayed as acting rebelliously or if the decision by the Leicester chief executive, Andrea Pinchen, to name the players on Wednesday is deemed to amount to a breach of confidentiality.“If I was acting for the players I would claim not just for the shortfall in wages but for damages too,” he said. “The way it has been spun, they’ve almost been painted as rebels for not agreeing to the pay cut. Naming them and breaching confidentiality – iIs it permissible for an employer to name and shame those players? That could carry a financial penalty.”Leicester declined to comment on Cramer’s remarks but issued a statement on Wednesday defending their actions, claiming the pandemic has cost them £5m in revenue with 31 staff members being made redundant. “We had to go down one path,” Pinchen said. “The majority of the people are all going down that path with us, because we believe in the future success of the club, and a handful couldn’t.”Meanwhile, Brad Barritt does not believe his achievements at Saracens have been diminished by the salary cap scandal, having announced he will leave the club when the season is completed. The Saracens captain has won five Premiership titles and three European Cups in his 12 years at the club but this season saw them condemned to relegation for their salary cap breaches.“You can’t stop what people think,” Barritt said. “I know what I personally put into the journey and how it made me feel. At no point did I ever feel that those memories are tarnished.”Barritt is mulling over whether to retire at the end of the season and while he would not consider a move to another English club, he could play on in South Africa.

We’re making real progress keeping hate speech off our platform, and we don’t benefit from this kind of content. But as we’ve said, we make policy changes based on principles, not revenue pressures,” the spokesperson said.On Wednesday, more than 500 companies officially kicked off an advertising boycott intended to pressure Facebook into taking a stronger stand against hate speech. Zuckerberg has agreed to meet with its organisers early next week.But whether Zuckerberg agrees to further tighten the social network’s carefully crafted rules probably boils down to a more fundamental question: does Facebook need big-brand advertisers more than the brands need Facebook?In a broad sense, the current boycott, which will last at least a month, is like nothing Facebook has experienced before. Following weeks of protests against police violence and racial injustice, major brands have for the first time joined together to protest against still-prevalent hate speech on Facebook’s platforms by taking aim at the social network’s $70bn in annual ad revenue.After years of piecemeal measures to address hate, abuse and misinformation on its service, Facebook’s critics hope that pinching the company where it hurts will push it toward more meaningful change. As of Wednesday, 530 companies had signed on and that is not counting businesses such as Target and Starbucks, which have paused advertising but did not formally join the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which calls its action “a pause” rather than a boycott.On Wednesday, Nick Clegg, Facebook’s vice-president of global affairs and communications, tried to reassure businesses that Facebook does not benefit from hate and said the company has every incentive to remove hate speech from its service. He acknowledged that “many of our critics are angry about the inflammatory rhetoric President Trump has posted on our platform and others, and want us to be more aggressive in removing his speech”.Clegg, however, offered few concessions, and instead repeated Zuckerberg’s frequent talking point that the only way to hold the powerful to account is ultimately through the ballot box. He pointed to Facebook’s get-out-the-vote efforts as evidence of the company’s commitment, along with the billions of dollars, tens of thousands of content moderators and other investments it has made in trying to improve its platform.While Facebook is making efforts to hear out its critics, it remains clear that ultimate decisions will always rest with its founder and CEO, who holds the majority of the company’s voting shares and could effectively run the company for life, should he desire to.Associated Press contributed to this article"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1b395a583f8fcdbf8eab7fffc31e8ff9ff2055/0_0_6944_4167/master/6944.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=135b45429e183e8b94433743f7f00cfe","title":"whatsapp groups conspiracy theories disinformation democracy","story":"As social media has become more inhospitable, the appeal of private online groups has grown. But they hold their own dangers – to those both inside and out.At first, many of the new uses were heartening. Mutual aid groups sprung up to help the vulnerable. Families and friends used the app to stay close, sharing their fears and concerns in real time. Yet by mid-April, the role that WhatsApp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker. A conspiracy theory about the rollout of 5G, which originated long before Covid-19 had appeared, now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease. Across the UK, people began setting fire to 5G masts, with 20 arson attacks over the Easter weekend alone.WhatsApp, along with Facebook and YouTube, was a key channel through which the conspiracy theory proliferated. Some feared that the very same community groups created during March were now accelerating the spread of the 5G conspiracy theory. Meanwhile, the app was also enabling the spread of fake audio clips, such as a widely shared recording in which someone who claimed to work for the NHS reported that ambulances would no longer be sent to assist people with breathing difficulties.This was not the first time that WhatsApp has been embroiled in controversy. While the “fake news” scandals surrounding the 2016 electoral upsets in the UK and US were more focused upon Facebook – which owns WhatsApp – subsequent electoral victories for Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and Narendra Modi in India were aided by incendiary WhatsApp messaging, exploiting the vast reach of the app in these countries. In India, there have also been reports of riots and at least 30 deaths linked to rumours circulating on WhatsApp. India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has sought ways of regulating WhatsApp content, though this has led to new controversies about government infringement on civil liberties.As ever, there is a risk of pinning too much blame for complex political crises on an inert technology. WhatsApp has also taken some steps to limit its use as a vehicle for misinformation. In March, a WhatsApp spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company had “engaged health ministries around the world to provide simple ways for citizens to receive accurate information about the virus”. But even away from such visible disruptions, WhatsApp does seem to be an unusually effective vehicle for sowing distrust in public institutions and processes.A WhatsApp group can exist without anyone outside the group knowing of its existence, who its members are or what is being shared, while end-to-end encryption makes it immune to surveillance. Back in Britain’s pre-Covid-19 days, when Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn were the issues that provoked the most feverish political discussions, speculation and paranoia swirled around such groups. Media commentators who defended Corbyn were often accused of belonging to a WhatsApp group of “outriders”, co-ordinated by Corbyn’s office, which supposedly told them what line to take. Meanwhile, the Conservative party’s pro-Brexit European Research Group was said to be chiefly sustained in the form of a WhatsApp group, whose membership was never public. Secretive coordination – both real and imagined – does not strengthen confidence in democracy.WhatsApp groups can not only breed suspicion among the public, but also manufacture a mood of suspicion among their own participants. As also demonstrated by closed Facebook groups, discontents – not always well-founded – accumulate in private before boiling over in public. The capacity to circulate misinformation and allegations is becoming greater than the capacity to resolve them.The political threat of WhatsApp is the flipside of its psychological appeal. Unlike so many other social media platforms, WhatsApp is built to secure privacy. On the plus side, this means intimacy with those we care about and an ability to speak freely on the negative side, it injects an ethos of secrecy and suspicion into the public sphere. As Facebook, Twitter and Instagram become increasingly theatrical – every gesture geared to impress an audience or deflect criticism – WhatsApp has become a sanctuary from a confusing and untrustworthy world, where users can speak more frankly. As trust in groups grows, so it is withdrawn from public institutions and officials. A new common sense develops, founded on instinctive suspicion towards the world beyond the group.The ongoing rise of WhatsApp, and its challenge to both legacy institutions and open social media, poses a profound political question: how do public institutions and discussions retain legitimacy and trust once people are organised into closed and invisible communities? The risk is that a vicious circle ensues, in which private groups circulate ever more information and disinformation to discredit public officials and public information, and our alienation from democracy escalates.The features that would later allow WhatsApp to become a conduit for conspiracy theory and political conflict were ones never integral to SMS, and have more in common with email: the creation of groups and the ability to forward messages. The ability to forward messages from one group to another – recently limited in response to Covid-19-related misinformation – makes for a potent informational weapon. Groups were initially limited in size to 100 people, but this was later increased to 256. That’s small enough to feel exclusive, but if 256 people forward a message on to another 256 people, 65,536 will have received it.Groups originate for all sorts of purposes – a party, organising amateur sport, a shared interest – but then take on a life of their own. There can be an anarchic playfulness about this, as a group takes on its own set of in-jokes and traditions. In a New York Magazine piece last year, under the headline “Group chats are making the internet fun again”, the technology critic Max Read argued that groups have become “an outright replacement for the defining mode of social organization of the past decade: the platform-centric, feed-based social network.”It’s understandable that in order to relax, users need to know they’re not being overheard – though there is a less playful side to this. If groups are perceived as a place to say what you really think, away from the constraints of public judgement or “political correctness”, then it follows that they are also where people turn to share prejudices or more hateful expressions, that are unacceptable (or even illegal) elsewhere. Santiago Abascal, the leader of the Spanish far-right party Vox, has defined his party as one willing to “defend what Spaniards say on WhatsApp”.A different type of group emerges where its members are all users of the same service, such as a school, a housing block or a training programme. A potential problem here is one of negative solidarity, in which feelings of community are deepened by turning against the service in question. Groups of this sort typically start from a desire to pool information – students staying in touch about deadlines, say – but can swiftly become a means of discrediting the institution they cluster around. Initial murmurs of dissatisfaction can escalate rapidly, until the group has forged an identity around a spirit of resentment and alienation, which can then be impossible to dislodge with countervailing evidence.Faced with the rise of new technologies, one option for formal organisations and associations is to follow people to their preferred platform. In March, the government introduced a WhatsApp-based information service about Covid-19, with an automated chatbot. But groups themselves can be an unreliable means of getting crucial information to people. Anecdotal evidence from local political organisers and trade union reps suggests that, despite the initial efficiency of WhatsApp groups, their workload often increases because of the escalating number of sub-communities, each of which needs to be contacted separately. Schools desperately seek to get information out to parents, only to discover that unless it appears in precisely the right WhatsApp group, it doesn’t register. The age of the message board, be it physical or digital, where information can be posted once for anyone who needs it, is over.WhatsApp’s ‘broadcast list’ function, which allows messages to be sent to multiple recipients who are invisible to one another (like email’s ‘bcc’ line), alleviates some of the problems of groups taking on a life of their own. But even then, lists can only include people who are already mutual contacts of the list-owner. The problem, from the point of view of institutions, is that WhatsApp use seems fuelled by a preference for informal, private communication as such. University lecturers are frequently baffled by the discovery that many students and applicants don’t read email. If email is going into decline, WhatsApp does not seem to be a viable alternative when it comes to sharing verified information as widely and inclusively as possible.Groups are great for brief bursts of humour or frustration, but, by their very nature, far less useful for supporting the circulation of public information. To understand why this is the case, we have to think about the way in which iniduals can become swayed and influenced once they belong to a group.The internet has brought with it its own litany of social pathologies and threats. Trolling, flaming, doxing, cancelling and pile-ons are all risks that go with socialising within a vast open architecture. “Open” platforms such as Twitter are reminders that much social activity tends to be aimed at a small and select community, but can be rendered comical or shameful when exposed to a different community altogether.As any frequent user of WhatsApp or a closed Facebook group will recognise, the moral anxiety associated with groups is rather different. If the worry in an open network is of being judged by some outside observer, be it one’s boss or an extended family member, in a closed group it is of saying something that goes against the codes that anchor the group’s identity. Groups can rapidly become dominated by a certain tone or worldview that is uncomfortable to challenge and nigh-impossible to dislodge. WhatsApp is a machine for generating feelings of faux pas, as comments linger in a group’s feed, waiting for a response.This means that while groups can generate high levels of solidarity, which can in principle be put to powerful political effect, it also becomes harder to express disagreement within the group. If, for example, an outspoken and popular member of a neighbourhood WhatsApp group begins to circulate misinformation about health risks, the general urge to maintain solidarity means that their messages are likely to be met with approval and thanks. When a claim or piece of content shows up in a group, there may be many members who view it as dubious the question is whether they have the confidence to say as much. Meanwhile, the less sceptical can simply forward it on. It’s not hard, then, to understand why WhatsApp is a powerful distributor of “fake news” and conspiracy theories.As on open social platforms, one of the chief ways of building solidarity on WhatsApp is to posit some injustice or enemy that threatens the group and its members. In the most acute examples, conspiracy theories are unleashed against political opponents, to the effect that they are paedophiles or secret affiliates of foreign powers. Such plausibly deniable practices swirled around the fringes of the successful election campaigns of Modi, Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, and across multiple platforms.But what makes WhatsApp potentially more dangerous than public social media are the higher levels of trust and honesty that are often present in private groups. It is a truism that nobody is as happy as they appear on Facebook, as attractive as they appear on Instagram or as angry as they appear on Twitter, which spawns a growing weariness with such endless performance. By contrast, closed groups are where people take off their public masks and let their critical guard down. Neither anonymity (a precondition of most trolling) nor celebrity are on offer. The speed with which rumours circulate on WhatsApp is partly a reflection of how altruistic and uncritical people can be in groups. Most of the time, people seem to share false theories about Covid-19 not with the intention of doing harm, but precisely out of concern for other group members. Anti-vaxx, anti-5G or anti-Hillary rumours combine an identification of an enemy with a strong internal sense of solidarity. Nevertheless, they add to the sense that the world is hostile and dangerous.There is one particular pattern of a group chat that can manufacture threats and injustices out of thin air. It tends to start with one participant speculating that they are being let down or targeted by some institution or rival group – be it a public service, business or cultural community – whereupon a second participant agrees. By this stage, it becomes risky for anyone else to defend the institution or group in question, and immediately a new enemy and a new resentment is born. Instantly, the warnings and denunciations emanating from within the group take on a level of authenticity that cannot be matched by the entity that is now the object of derision.But what if the first contributor has misunderstood or misread something, or had a very stressful day and needs to let off steam? And what if the second is merely agreeing so as to make the first one feel better? And what if the other members are either too distracted, too inhibited or too exhausted to say anything to oppose this fresh indignation? This needn’t snowball into the forms of conspiracy theory that produce riots or arson attacks. But even in milder forms, it makes the job of communicating official information – occasionally life-saving information – far more troublesome than it was just a decade ago. Information about public services and health risks is increasingly having to penetrate a thicket of overlapping groups, many of which may have developed an instinctive scepticism to anything emanating from the “mainstream”.Part of the challenge for institutions is that there is often a strange emotional comfort in the shared feeling of alienation and passivity. “We were never informed about that”, “nobody consulted us”, “we are being ignored”. These are dominant expressions of our political zeitgeist. As WhatsApp has become an increasingly common way of encountering information and news, a vicious circle can ensue: the public world seems ever more distant, impersonal and fake, and the private group becomes a space of sympathy and authenticity.This is a new twist in the evolution of the social internet. Since the 90s, the internet has held out a promise of connectivity, openness and inclusion, only to then confront inevitable threats to privacy, security and identity. By contrast, groups make people feel secure and anchored, but also help to fragment civil society into separate cliques, unknown to one another. This is the outcome of more than 20 years of ideological battles over what sort of social space the internet should be.For a few years at the dawn of the millennium, the O’Reilly Emerging Technology Conferences (or ETech), were a crucible in which a new digital world was imagined and debated. Launched by the west coast media entrepreneur Tim O’Reilly and hosted annually around California, the conferences attracted a mixture of geeks, gurus, designers and entrepreneurs, brought together more in a spirit of curiosity than of commerce. In 2005, O’Reilly coined the term “web 2.0” to describe a new wave of websites that connected users with each other, rather than with existing offline institutions. Later that year, the domain name facebook was purchased by a 21-year-old Harvard student, and the age of the giant social media platforms was born.Within this short window of time, we can see competing ideas of what a desirable online community might look like. The more idealistic tech gurus who attended ETech insisted that the internet should remain an open public space, albeit one in which select communities could cluster for their own particular purposes, such as creating open-source software projects or Wikipedia entries. The untapped potential of the internet, they believed, was for greater democracy. But for companies such as Facebook, the internet presented an opportunity to collect data about users en masse. The internet’s potential was for greater surveillance. The rise of the giant platforms from 2005 onwards suggested the latter view had won out. And yet, in a strange twist, we are now witnessing a revival of anarchic, self-organising digital groups – only now, in the hands of Facebook as well. The two competing visions have collided.To see how this story unfolded, it’s worth going back to 2003. At the ETech conference that year, a keynote speech was given by the web enthusiast and writer Clay Shirky, now an academic at New York University, which surprised its audience by declaring that the task of designing successful online communities had little to do with technology at all. The talk looked back at one of the most fertile periods in the history of social psychology, and was entitled “A group is its own worst enemy”.Shirky drew on the work of the British psychoanalyst and psychologist Wilfred Bion, who, together with Kurt Lewin, was one of the pioneers of the study of “group dynamics” in the 40s. The central proposition of this school was that groups possess psychological properties that exist independently of their inidual members. In groups, people find themselves behaving in ways that they never would if left to their own devices.Like Stanley Milgram’s notorious series of experiments to test obedience in the early 60s – in which some participants were persuaded to administer apparently painful electric shocks to others – the mid-20th century concern with group dynamics grew in the shadow of the political horrors of the 30s and 40s, which had posed grave questions about how iniduals come to abandon their ordinary sense of morality. Lewin and Bion posited that groups possess distinctive personalities, which emerge organically through the interaction of their members, independently of what rules they might have been given, or what iniduals might rationally do alone.With the dawn of the 60s, and its more inidualistic political hopes, psychologists’ interest in groups started to wane. The assumption that iniduals are governed by conformity fell by the wayside. When Shirky introduced Bion’s work at the O’Reilly conference in 2003, he was going out on a limb. What he correctly saw was that, in the absence of any explicit structures or rules, online communities were battling against many of the disruptive dynamics that fascinated the psychologists of the 40s.Shirky highlighted one area of Bion’s work in particular: how groups can spontaneously sabotage their own stipulated purpose. The beauty of early online communities, such as listservs, message boards and wikis, was their spirit of egalitarianism, humour and informality. But these same properties often worked against them when it came to actually getting anything constructive done, and could sometimes snowball into something obstructive or angry. Once the mood of a group was erted towards jokes, disruption or hostility towards another group, it became very difficult to wrest it back.Bion’s concerns originated in fear of humanity’s darker impulses, but the vision Shirky was putting to his audience that day was a more optimistic one. If the designers of online spaces could preempt disruptive “group dynamics”, he argued, then it might be possible to support cohesive, productive online communities that remained open and useful at the same time. Like a well designed park or street, a well-designed online space might nurture healthy sociability without the need for policing, surveillance or closure to outsiders. Between one extreme of anarchic chaos (constant trolling), and another of strict moderation and regulation of discussion (acceding to an authority figure), thinking in terms of group dynamics held out the promise of a social web that was still largely self-organising, but also relatively orderly.But there was another solution to this same problem waiting in the wings, which would turn out to be world-changing in its consequences: forget group dynamics, and focus on reputation dynamics instead. If someone online has a certain set of offline attributes, such as a job title, an album of tagged photos, a list of friends and an email address, they will behave themselves in ways that are appropriate to all of these fixed public identifiers. Add more and more surveillance into the mix, both by one’s peers and by corporations, and the problem of spontaneous group dynamics disappears. It is easier to hold on to your self-control and your conscience if you are publicly visible, including to friends, extended family and colleagues.For many of the Californian pioneers of cyberculture, who cherished online communities as an escape from the values and constraints of capitalist society, Zuckerberg’s triumph represents an unmitigated defeat. Corporations were never meant to seize control of this space. As late as 2005, the hope was that the social web would be built around democratic principles and bottom-up communities. Facebook abandoned all of that, by simply turning the internet into a multimedia telephone directory.The last ETech was held in 2009. Within a decade, Facebook was being accused of pushing liberal democracy to the brink and even destroying truth itself. But as the demands of social media have become more onerous, with each of us curating a profile and projecting an identity, the lure of the autonomous group has resurfaced once again. In some respects, Shirky’s optimistic concern has now become today’s pessimistic one. Partly thanks to WhatsApp, the unmoderated, self-governing, amoral collective – larger than a conversation, smaller than a public – has become a dominant and disruptive political force in our society, much as figures such as Bion and Lewin feared.Conspiracy theories and paranoid group dynamics were features of political life long before WhatsApp arrived. It makes no sense to blame the app for their existence, any more than it makes sense to blame Facebook for Brexit. But by considering the types of behaviour and social structures that technologies enable and enhance, we get a better sense of some of society’s characteristics and ailments. What are the general tendencies that WhatsApp helps to accelerate?First of all, there is the problem of conspiracies in general. WhatsApp is certainly an unbeatable conduit for circulating conspiracy theories, but we must also admit that it seems to be an excellent tool for facilitating genuinely conspiratorial behaviour. One of the great difficulties when considering conspiracy theories in today’s world is that, regardless of WhatsApp, some conspiracies turn out to be true: consider Libor-fixing, phone-hacking, or efforts by Labour party officials to thwart Jeremy Corbyn’s electoral prospects. These all happened, but one would have sounded like a conspiracy theorist to suggest them until they were later confirmed by evidence.A communication medium that connects groups of up to 256 people, without any public visibility, operating via the phones in their pockets, is by its very nature, well-suited to supporting secrecy. Obviously not every group chat counts as a “conspiracy”. But it makes the question of how society coheres, who is associated with whom, into a matter of speculation – something that involves a trace of conspiracy theory. In that sense, WhatsApp is not just a channel for the circulation of conspiracy theories, but offers content for them as well. The medium is the message.The full political potential of WhatsApp has not been witnessed in the UK. To date, it has not served as an effective political campaigning tool, partly because users seem reluctant to join large groups with people they don’t know. However, the influence – imagined or real – of WhatsApp groups within Westminster and the media undoubtedly contributes to the deepening sense that public life is a sham, behind which lurk invisible networks through which power is coordinated. WhatsApp has become a kind of “backstage” of public life, where it is assumed people articulate what they really think and believe in secret. This is a sensibility that has long fuelled conspiracy theories, especially antisemitic ones. Invisible WhatsApp groups now offer a modern update to the type of “explanation” that once revolved around Masonic lodges or the Rothschilds.Away from the world of party politics and news media, there is the prospect of a society organised as a tapestry of overlapping cliques, each with their own internal norms. Groups are less likely to encourage heterodoxy or risk-taking, and more likely to inculcate conformity, albeit often to a set of norms hostile to those of the “mainstream”, whether that be the media, politics or professional public servants simply doing their jobs. In the safety of the group, it becomes possible to have one’s cake and eat it, to be simultaneously radical and orthodox, hyper-sceptical and yet unreflective.For all the benefits that WhatsApp offers in helping people feel close to others, its rapid ascendency is one further sign of how a common public world – based upon verified facts and recognised procedures – is disintegrating. WhatsApp is well equipped to support communications on the margins of institutions and public discussion: backbenchers plotting coups, parents gossipping about teachers, friends sharing edgy memes, journalists circulating rumours, family members forwarding on unofficial medical advice. A society that only speaks honestly on the margins like this will find it harder to sustain the legitimacy of experts, officials and representatives who, by definition, operate in the spotlight. Meanwhile, distrust, alienation and conspiracy theories become the norm, chipping away at the institutions that might hold us together. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b33ad00411039588c31265caee61df9958e97999/0_41_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677b8909da8ccc9b9232635f4db4d73","title":"10 of the best uk campsites readers travel tips","story":"Combining open air with social distancing, a stay at a UK campsite will be a popular option this year.

The British side will bear all the consequences,” the foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing in Beijing.Zhao’s comments came after the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, said he would honour a promise to offer nearly 3 million residents of the former British colony, those with British national overseas status (BNO), the right to settle in the UK.Earlier on Thursday, China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, also said any move to grant residency to BNO holders would be a violation of agreements between the two countries. The UK’s detailed proposals are not likely to be ready until September, but already some activists are leaving.It was clear that “all Chinese compatriots residing in Hong Kong are Chinese nationals, whether or not they are holders of the British dependent territories citizens passport or the British national (overseas) passport”, he said.“If the British side makes unilateral changes to the relevant practice, it will breach its own position and pledges as well as international law.“We firmly oppose this and reserve the right to take corresponding measures,” he said in a statement posted on the embassy’s website on Thursday. “The UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong.”Since the Hong Kong law went into effect late on Tuesday, at least 10 people have been arrested on national security related charges, including a 15-year old girl who waved a Hong Kong independence flag. On Wednesday, a total of almost 400 people were detained on other charges such as unlawful assembly, as thousands protested against the law.Human rights advocates and residents, fearing the security legislation will be used to arrest protesters and pro-democracy activists, have called on countries to allow Hongkongers to seek refuge in their countries.On Thursday, the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, said his country was working on a scheme to provide a safe haven to Hong Kong residents after China’s “very concerning” decision. Morrison said Australia was “prepared to step up and provide support”, although his cabinet was yet to finalise the details, including whether the scheme would include a pathway to permanent settlement.The UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has admitted there is little Britain can do to “coercively force” China if it tries to block Hongkongers from coming to the UK.He told ITV’s Peston programme on Wednesday: “Ultimately if they follow through on something like that there would be little that we could do to coercively force them.”Raab continued: “There is an issue around freedom and human rights in Hong Kong, and there is an issue around China keeping its word on an international obligation it made to the United Kingdom back in 1984.“I wouldn’t want to be naive about this I think we need to be realistic. But I do think that China as a rising, leading member of the international community is sensitive to the reputational risk in all of this, but clearly not sufficiently that it hasn’t proceeded anyway ... There is diplomatic leverage, there are other ways that we can persuade China not to fully implement either the national security law or some of the reprisals you talk about.“But ultimately we need to be honest that we wouldn’t be able to force China to allow BNOs to come to the UK.”Raab said he was working with other countries in the region to discuss a lifeboat operation. He said: “We think the majority will probably hunker down in Hong Kong, and others would leave to other countries in the region.”But the scale of the UK’s coming diplomatic challenge was highlighted when China claimed 53 countries had put their names to a Cuba sponsored statement at the UN Human Rights Council on Tuesday supporting the Chinese government’s new security laws in Hong Kong. The UK had touted the support of 27 mainly European and Asian countries. China’s support group included 15 African countries, left and right wing autocracies and a smattering of the Gulf monarchies normally close to the UK. The list underlined how the UK has lost sway in Africa over the past 5 years to China. Many of the European countries that did back the UK did so nervously fearing criticism of China might lead to a trade backlash. The UK government believes the new security legislation passed by Beijing breaches the Sino-British joint declaration, which aimed to smooth the transition when the territory was handed back to China in 1997.Johnson has said he will honour a promise to change immigration rules to allow holders of BNO passports, as well as those eligible for the passport, to reside in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship.As of February, there were nearly 350,000 BNO passport holders, while the government estimated there were around 2.9 million BNOs living in Hong Kong.China has argued that a memorandum attached to the Sino-British joint declaration does not grant right of abode to those eligible for BNO status, but legal experts say the UK is not barred from extending their rights.Downing Street said those with BNO status would be eligible to travel to the UK immediately before the details of the scheme were finalised “in the coming weeks” and that they would not face salary thresholds.The security law in Hong Kong, enacted late after an opaque legislative process that took less than six weeks, criminalises a broad swathe of behaviours deemed as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.Critics say the law gives authorities sweeping new powers to crack down on dissent and a new level of Chinese control over the semi-autonomous territory.Liu was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday, where the permanent secretary, Sir Simon McDonald, told him the imposition of the new legislation on Hong Kong breached the Sino-British joint declaration.Following his visit, Liu tweeted: “After turbulent months in the latter half of last year, the national security law will bring the order＆stability to Hong Kong and get its economy back on track.”China views its actions as one of the last steps towards decolonisation, but an early test of its willingness to preserve the country’s freedoms will come in the autumn elections for the legislature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1edd58e0853d84769e5647fda0ea254540dd19f4/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f480aa2fa43c41a57036a5cb90c14ad","title":"leading democracy campaigner nathan law leaves hong kong","story":"Activist says he fled city because he faced ‘unknown dangers’ under national security lawNathan Law, one of Hong Kong’s leading democracy campaigners, has left the city, as protestors and other residents weigh up their future and wait for Britain to lay out details of its offer of a path to citizenship.Law said on social media that he had left Hong Kong for an undisclosed location because he faced “unknown dangers”, after China brought in a sweeping national security law for the city that criminalises much of the protest movement.The implications of the law, which was not made public until it came into effect this week, are still being digested in Hong Kong and among citizens abroad. Many who were part of the protest movements or who fear what the future will be like under closer Chinese control are already weighing up offers from the UK and other countries.Nearly 3 million city residents who hold British national overseas status (BNO) have been promised the right to settle in the UK by Boris Johnson and are waiting for details on the scheme.“I’m stuck between moving back to Hong Kong or waiting for updated information regarding the new plans for BNO holders,” the woman said. “I am worried that if I have to go back to Hong Kong, I won’t be allowed to come back to the UK.”The US has also proposed specific refugee assistance, and Australia has flagged an imminent announcement, while Taiwan has set up an office to assist fleeing Hong Kongers and said it had already received more than 180 enquiries. Taipei also updated its travel advicem warning people against unnecessary travel through Hong Kong.Law, who at 24 is part of a generation of young activists who re-energised the city’s battle for democracy over the last decade, said he had moved overseas so he could safely continue his battle for Hong Kong’s future there.“After this farewell, I don’t know when I’ll ever return. I’ll never forget the sparkling scene of Hong Kong from the plane,” he said.Joshua Wong, Law’s colleague at the political group Demosisto, which was disbanded hours before the national security law took effect, said on Facebook: “Thank you, Nathan. It’s not an easy decision.”When contacted by the , Wong refused to say whether he was also considering leaving, although he cannot travel at present because he is on bail pending a court case. Wong was helping a politician distribute flyers on Thursday evening."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f616a57fa59d157df5bbfa56d8e3611411c64253/0_104_4731_2839/master/4731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9fbf513a7f58c2a5bfa3682b8ccbcde","title":"living in hong kong are you thinking about settling in the uk","story":"We would like to hear from those eligible for the right to settle in the UK on whether they are thinking of leaving Hong KongIn response to the UK prime minister offering nearly 3 million residents in Hong Kong the right to settle in the UK, China has said it would take “corresponding measures” to stop it from happening.We would like to hear from people as to whether they are thinking of relocating to the UK or any other country.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056..

Those are the basic needs. But we don’t need to wear any face masks during the playdates, thank God”.She added that “most of us will avoid face to face, so no kissing”.Felicia Anna said that “after the customer leaves the room, we’re going to disinfect everything he might have touched, bed, sink, the toilet if he used the toilet, the doorknobs, everything”.But she said that sex workers were already well versed in hygiene, adding: “We already dealt with much bigger diseases than corona.”Dutch deputy prime minister Hugo de Jonge said on Wednesday that a “new phase in the approach to coronavirus begins” but urged people to remain vigilant.The Netherlands legalised prostitution in 2000 and sex workers have to register with the local chamber of commerce and pay income tax. Around 7,000 now work in Amsterdam, according to official figures.Anna said the red light district would “certainly” be more affected because “a lot of sex workers” who often come from eastern Europe and South America returned to their home countries during the lockdown and are still not allowed to travel back to the Netherlands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/22ef989f7ce58c0039214648c3c31adb30e79c99/0_0_3252_1952/master/3252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f24e94dad27293d78c6dff9a9e927f5","title":"parts of south west scotland excluded from lockdown relaxation","story":"Nicola Sturgeon announces easing of restrictions for most of Scotland apart from area with cluster of Covid-19 cases Nicola Sturgeon has told people in Dumfries and Galloway they cannot yet relax any lockdown rules after an outbreak of Covid-19 cases straddling the border with England.She said those living around Gretna, Annan, Dumfries, Lockerbie, Langholm and Canonbie were still required to stay within five miles of their homes, while outdoor restaurants, pub gardens and care homes would remain closed to visitors at least until next week.Scotland’s first minister urged locals not to travel to pubs and restaurants in England, which are expected to reopen this weekend, as a precautionary measure until the outbreak had been dealt with.These lockdown rules are being relaxed for the rest of Scotland on 3 July, but she said 10 new Covid-19 cases had emerged in south-west Scotland, with workers at two factories and a health worker based at Cumberland hospital in Carlisle affected.Mobile testing units were being sent to the factories, while local health officials had launched a concerted contact-tracing effort. Those restrictions would remain in place until next week at the earliest.“What we’ve applied today is a targeted, proportionate intervention to try to manage risk,” she said.Jason Leitch, the Scottish government’s national clinical director, said there had been “excellent cooperation” between NHS officials in Dumfries and Galloway and Cumbria.He said there was no evidence of a wider outbreak beyond the Cumberland hospital but the three workplaces were “high risk” sites. Further tests to assess a suspected outbreak in Grampian had found there was no local cluster, however.Leitch said staff at Young’s Seafood in Annan and Alpha Solway in Annan, which makes personal protection equipment for the Scottish government, were affected although there was no evidence these factories were the source of the infection.For the rest of Scotland, outdoor cafes and beer gardens will be allowed to reopen from Monday, after the R number, the rate of infection from coronavirus remained at 0.6 to 0.8, with only about 1,500 people in Scotland thought to be infected.From 10 July, face coverings would be mandatory in all Scotland’s shops, she added, following similar requirements on public transport and in taxis. The police would empowered to enforce these measures with on-the-spot fines, as a “backstop”, she said.Sturgeon said Scotland’s physical distancing rules requiring people to stay 2 metres apart would be relaxed for some shops and businesses from 9 July, with customers to be warned when they were entering a 1-metre zone.The precise details of those mitigation measures for the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors would be announced later on Thursday, to the relief of business and tourism leaders.Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses in the hard-pressed retail, hospitality and tourism sectors will welcome this flexibility. Being able to reduce distances from 2 metres to 1 metre will mean more businesses can now start planning to re-open.”Children under 11 would be allowed to mingle freely without any social distancing from Friday 3 July said Dr Gregor Smith, Scotland’s chief medical officer. The restrictions would remain in place for teenagers, and they would still be asked to meet outside in groups no larger than eight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5568016b089a597ad44acf236a0a6bb9ee4f6ab/0_1634_6334_3801/master/6334.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ee2cf6aff807c2878ced3c3bb5dea5d8","title":"uk air bridge plans labelled a fiasco by unions","story":"After week of delays and leaks, government has yet to publish list of countries for travellersThe UK government’s plans to unveil a list of foreign destinations that Britons can travel to has been branded a “fiasco” by union chiefs after a week of delays and a series of leaks in which a verified list of countries has still not been published.The government said last Friday it would shortly reveal a list of countries people could travel to without having to self-isolate for 14 days. This is seen as critical for kick-starting the tourism industry and safeguarding jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic.However with just days to go until 6 July, the date when new rules on “air bridges” to holiday destinations were expected to be introduced, the government has not yet announced which countries will be on their list.“The government’s quarantine rules have been a fiasco from the outset,” said Manuel Cortes, the general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association.“The fact is we did not stop people coming into our country when our infection rates were very high. Then, in early June, Priti Patel introduced a blanket quarantine period for all arrivals when many countries had, by this point, done a far better job than our government at controlling the spread of the virus.“We have now been told for almost a week that a change of policy is on its way, without knowing the details. Frankly, this is courting disaster – many of our members’ jobs are under threat because their employers don’t know what holidays they are allowed to sell.”There were briefings earlier this week that a list of core Mediterranean countries would be released, including Spain, France and Greece, on Wednesday or Thursday. The reciprocal air-bridge arrangement would mean passengers travelling between the UK and those countries would not need to self-isolate, enabling holidays to start immediately.Government sources then revealed that plan had been abandoned instead, the Foreign Office is expected to lift its ban on non-essential travel to up to 95 countries, including nearly all EU countries, British overseas territories, such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Australia and New Zealand. Turkey, a popular holiday destination for Britons, is also expected to be included in the list.On Wednesday night, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was dispatched to try to smooth over the proposal with Scotland, which had expressed reservations, but just hours later the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, blamed Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Strugeon, for holding up progress.In transport questions in the Commons on Thursday, Shapps said the devolved administrations needed to “get onboard” so the policy could be announced.Sturgeon insisted Scotland had not been adequately consulted and that the UK’s position had changed three times in the previous 24 hours. She said the idea Scotland was responsible for delays was “completely unfounded”.Shapps told Scottish National party MPs in Westminster that they needed to lean on Sturgeon to get her to change her mind.Responding to a question from the SNP’s transport spokesman, Gavin Newlands, he said: “I’m very keen to get the devolved administrations, including Scotland’s government, onboard so we can get this thing announced.”All of the countries due to be included on the travel list are likely to be on the government’s green list of low-risk nations for coronavirus, or from its amber list, which is medium risk.The difficulty travellers may now face is the inidual circumstances of countries they want to visit, such as those that have suspended flights from the UK, or closed their borders entirely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35d944fb7da98f749d4009b9f8471b5f2c85467e/0_0_6448_3870/master/6448.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=199b93441b49e33bbd7e397fd43962ba","title":"uk to lift ban on non essential travel to up to 90 countries","story":"Change set to allow visits to nearly all EU countries, British overseas territories and Australia and New ZealandOverseas holidays and visits to up to 90 countries will be possible for Britons from Monday without the need to quarantine for 14 days on return.The Foreign Office is expected to lift its ban on non-essential travel to nearly all EU countries, British territories such as Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Australia and New Zealand.Turkey, a popular holiday destination, is also expected to be included in the list.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The announcement, confirmed by government officials and due on Friday, puts an end to the air-bridge or travel corridor policy that has been pursued by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, for several weeks.This would have involved setting up reciprocal arrangements with a core of Mediterranean countries including France, Greece and Spain to not quarantine each other’s citizens.Since 8 June, nearly all passengers have been required to go into self-isolation for 14 days at a declared address when they arrive in the UK. People who fail to comply can be fined £1,000 in England.But as officials confirmed the number of countries to be included on the list, the Westminster blamed the Scottish government for holding up a final announcement.Shapps, said that the devolved administrations needed to “get on board” so they could get the policy announced.The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said Scotland had not been adequately consulted and that the UK’s position had changed three times in the past 24 hours.Shapps told Scottish National party MPs in Westminster that they needed to lean on Sturgeon to change her mind.Responding to the SNP’s transport spokesman, Gavin Newlands, he said: “I’m very keen to get the devolved administrations, including Scotland’s government, on board so we can get this thing announced.”He told Dr Philippa Whitford, the SNP MP for Central Ayrshire: “There is something the honourable member may be pleased that she can do, which is to ask the Scottish government to join with us in ensuring we have these air bridges in place nationwide as soon as possible.” All of the countries due to be included in the new travel list are likely to be on the government’s green list of low-risk nations for coronavirus, or from the amber list, which is medium risk.The difficulty travellers may now face is the inidual circumstances of countries they want to visit, such as those that have suspended flights from the UK, or closed their borders entirely.While Britons may be free to travel to Australia and New Zealand, both of those countries have currently closed their borders to almost all visitors.Greece, with which the government had been trying to establish a well-publicised air-bridge and which may have been a catalyst for the policy unravelling, has suspended all flights from the UK and Sweden until 15 July.The air-bridges policy, which the government announced last Friday, has been beset with uncertainty, including resistance from Sturgeon, who said Scotland had not been properly consulted and had to protect its low infection rate.The chief medical officer in Wales also suggested there should be no change to the 14-day quarantine rule for travellers into the UK.The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, was dispatched by government on Wednesday night to talk to his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland about ending the blanket quarantine policy. This comes after a four-nations meeting with the cabinet minister Michael Gove on Monday.The European commission has previously warned that the UK government could face a legal challenge unless it considered air-bridge arrangements to all EU countries with similar infection rates.BA, easyJet and Ryanair are also set to bring a case in the high court seeking to overturn the government’s quarantine policy, which they claim is “irrational and disproportionate”.The ban on non-essential travel to countries on the government’s “red” list, such as the US, Russia and Brazil, will continue and anyone returning will have to continue with the 14-day quarantine measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39ae5e66432f009630410252b8832e92ab20d983/220_540_4451_2671/master/4451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6370f4df7abc85f6c8675282f233f7df","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about coming out of lockdown","story":"As lockdown restrictions ease we want to hear how you feel about itFrom this weekend, pubs and restaurants, cinemas, museums, galleries and hairdressers in England will be allowed to reopen their doors.On Monday, people in England with underlying health issues who have been shielding since March will be allowed to leave their homes.They will be able to meet up outside in groups of up to six people from different households, provided they keep 2 metres apart, and they will no longer have to remain 2 metres apart from the rest of their household at home.If you have been shielding since March we would like to hear how you feel about lockdown restrictions easing.You can get in touch by filling in the form below or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056.

They must follow higher safety standards than other drugs because they are given to millions of healthy people.In the pre-clinical stage of testing, researchers give the vaccine to animals to see if it triggers an immune response. In phase 1 of clinical testing, the vaccine is given to a small group of people to determine whether it is safe and to learn more about the immune response it provokes.

In phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people to confirm its safety – including rare side effects – and effectiveness. These trials involve a control group which is given a placebo.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollinsTaoiseach Micheál Martin said Ireland owed chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan a debt of gratitude for helping navigate the Covid-19 crisis.Mr Martin thanked him for his service and noted he had become a familiar face to the public during his time at the helm of the Government response.Dr Holohan said on Thursday evening he was stepping back from the post to spend time with his wife, who has terminal cancer, and two teenage children.“His work, experience and briefings helped people to understand the gravity of the situation facing us, while his calmness reassured us that if we followed the guidelines and advice, we would overcome these great challenges together,” Mr Martin put in a statement.“Every home in Ireland has come to know Dr Tony Holohan. His leadership during the pandemic has given us all confidence that the decisions being made are based on solid public health advice. As a country we owe him and his family a great debt of gratitude.”Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who just this week took charge of his department, also paid tribute to Dr Holohan’s “extraordinary commitment and professionalism” during the pandemic.“He has been a rock, and he will be back as a rock,” Mr Donnelly said.He said the National Public Health Emergency Team had worked “night and day” and had “brought us to where we are” under his leadership.Continuity in this work was vital and would be guaranteed with the leadership of deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn, who had attended nightly briefings at Dr Holohan’s side since the pandemic began, the Minister said.‘Incredible servant’Dr Holohan’s announcement, which came at the end of a department press briefing, also drew widespread comment on social media.Former minister for health Simon Harris, who had worked closely with Dr Holohan since the outbreak of the coronavirus emergency, described him as a “patriot”.He is “an incredible public servant and a doctor who has saved thousands of lives through his leadership. He has kept us safe. I valued his counsel as minister so much. Thank you to his family for sharing him with us. We think of them and respect their privacy.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar also expressed his gratitude.“For months everyone in Ireland has felt safe because you were looking after our families,” he said. “As you step back, know that all of us stand behind you and your wonderful family. We’ll meet again soon.”Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald and Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill also took to social media to express support.Northern Ireland health minister Robin Swann and chief medical officer for the North Dr Michael McBride said: “Our thoughts are very much with Dr Tony Holohan, his wife Emer, their children and family circle at this time.“We have worked very closely with Tony and his colleagues in the Republic of Ireland from the beginning of the Coronavirus pandemic. We very much appreciate all their support, co-operation and friendship.“This is devastating news. The family can be assured of the support and compassion of everyone across this island.”Dr Holohan has held the position in the department for the past 12 years but has never been more prominent in the public eye than since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.He graduated from University College Dublin in 1991 and trained in general practice and later in public health medicine."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

He said his wife Emer Feely, who is also a doctor, was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer called multiple myeloma in 2012. “She has had a number of difficult years with her disease and was admitted for palliative care last Saturday,” he said at Thursday night’s briefing by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), which he chairs.“From now on I want to give my energy, attention and all of my time to Emer and to our two teenage children, Clodagh and Ronan.” He said he informed Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on Thursday. A plan has been put in place for others to take over different aspects of his responsibilities, he said. Dr Ronan Glynn has been appointed acting chief medical officer and will chair future public health emergency team briefings.“As a husband and father, and as a public health doctor, I am conscious that we have been through tough times together over the last number of months and many families across the country have been affected by the course of Covid-19, suffering pain and the loss of loved ones,” said Dr Holohan. “I hope that we can all remain working together to continue to stay vigilant.” SupportHe thanked everyone for their support and asked that his family’s privacy be respected. Dr Holohan has been in his position for the last 12 years, but has never been more prominent in the public eye than since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis.

A total of 1,738 people have died of the disease since the pandemic began and 25,489 cases have been confirmed. NPHET expressed concern about an increase in recent days in the level of transmission of Covid-19 in the community.Northern IrelandEarlier, Northern Ireland’s Department of Health reported one more Covid-19 death, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 552. The department also said seven additional cases of the disease had been confirmed, taking the total to 5,768. A total of 113,283 people have been tested for the disease in Northern Ireland to date.According to the report, the incidence of the disease in Ireland in the past 14 days is 2.9 cases per 100,000. Many of the countries that Irish holidaymakers travel to in summer have much higher incidences than us – Spain has an incidence of 9.9, Portugal 47.4, Italy 5.2, France 10.3, the UK 22.7 and Turkey 22.9.The Fianna Fáil TD said the Covid-19 pandemic internationally has become “quite volatile” with just over one million of the 10 million cases being recorded in the past week with a big increase in infections in France, Portugal and Spain in the last two weeks.Foreign travel now accounts for 17 per cent of new cases, an increase from about 2 per cent of cases in recent weeks, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Rights groups says \u0026lsquono clear evidence\u0026rsquo contact tracing system will accurately detect close encountersHistoric Dublin library tweeted about exhibition\u0026rsquos funding after being questioned by a visitorHealth expert says the reproduction number for the disease has increased hereChief medical officer taking time out to care for his wife, who has terminal cancerMartin vows to maintain \u0026lsquocommon unity of purpose\u0026rsquo among the Government partnersPublic health emergency chief to spend time with wife, now in palliative care, and childrenDiarmuid Martin says Republic should follow Northern Ireland where the permitted attendance is based on the size of each churchINTO says one-metre distancing will pose challenge, especially with \u0026lsquosuper-size\u0026rsquo classes.Action over three 190-year-old properties at Seville Place Dublin, were struck outFianna F\u0026aacuteil\u0026rsquos Mary Butler expects lack of laws to deal with online abuse will be \u0026lsquocorrected\u0026rsquo soon\u0026lsquoI want my staff to work without fear.

Photograph: Elizabeth Toher “The juice sommelier will be with you shortly,” says Ashford Castle’s restaurant manager Robert Bowe as he seats me by a window in the dining room.A juice sommelier? Is that a thing now? It certainly is in one of Ireland’s grandest hotels, one which reopens this weekend after more than 100 days in the most elegant of mothballs.The role was created because the breakfast buffet has been claimed by Covid-19. And with it has gone the simple pleasure of pouring whatever juice that takes your fancy of a morning in a swish hotel.Bowe stands by the tableside wearing a full face visor and points at the crisp linen napkin. “Normally I’d flip that for you but with social distancing and all that,” he says.He gestures towards the breakfast menus and a card embossed with QR codes. “If guests prefer to get the menu on their phones and make the experience completely contactless they can scan those,” he explains.Then the cheery juice sommelier arrives wearing an Ashford face mask and wheeling a cart of brightly coloured bottles sitting on a mountain of ice. He runs through the options before mischievously adding “A glass of champagne, perhaps?” It’s not yet 9am. Welcome to a different world.Since Ashford closed on March 19th, its general manager Niall Rochford has been plotting a complex course between evolving coronavirus rules and a fierce determination to provide the service for which the hotel is famed. As go-time nears it’s clear he and his team have pulled off what even he thought could not be done three months ago.“If you told me in March we’d have staff in masks, I’d have said ‘No way!’”, he declares from behind his own face visor. “But I think they work and I like how you can see our faces that connection is so important. We have masks too. I want my staff to work with confidence and without fear. A mask or a visor will not get in the way of us delivering great service.”He says the cleaning routine hasn’t changed that much. “We’ve always done it. Although some things we did were in the background and will become more visible. There will be more overt cleaning because that gives guests an extra level of reassurance.”Guests will see reassurance at every turn from the moment they drive through the granite gates to be greeted by a smiling gatekeeper in personal protective equipment. The pen used to sign check-in papers is sanitised before and after each signature and sits in a sanitised holder. The “covid gift pack” with its surgical mask, hand sanitiser and gloves is tastefully presented in a glossy Ashford bag.The social distancing is impeccably observed and the hand sanitiser bottles sprinkled around the common areas serve as a constant but gentle reminder to guests that everyone has a role to play in keeping all safe.The expansive wine list comes in the form of an electronic tablet while breakfast time slots have to be reserved with access to the spa, pool and cinema carefully monitored. The television remotes have always been santisied but now there are notes on the sherry decanters assuring guests they have been poured exclusively for them while notes on the in-room magazines offer a similar assurance to guests that they will be only ones to read them. What little Plexiglass there is comes adorned with the Ashford logo. One of the most noticeable things about the safety measures rolled out is how fast they stop being noticeable.Almost all of the talk about reopening Ireland in recent weeks has focused on process. But in Ashford what is most striking are the people behind the process. The excitement and emotion among staff is hard to miss as they wander halls and prepare to greet guests.‘I just burst into tears’Wednesday was a return to work for Paula Carroll, the hotel’s head of marketing, and as she talks about her her first sight of the castle on the horizon when rounding that final bend her voice cracks and her eyes tear up. “I was so emotional. I’d butterflies and then I saw the staff lined up and just burst into tears. It is so wonderful to be back I could cry again.”Then she does.Even as 50 of the hotel’s 83 rooms reopen, Rochford knows getting back to normal is only starting and will be difficult. The hotel will not have the well-heeled Americans who comprise a significant portion of its guest book. As many as 360 private planes land in Knock Airport annually, carrying Ashford-bound passengers and about 80 per cent of its custom base is from overseas.“Things will be difficult. We know that and it will be at least three years before we get back to where we were,” says Rochford before heading off to put the finishing touches to his big weekend and the start of the road back.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"bobby storey the ira s planner and enforcer who stayed in the shadows","story":"Nearly 1,800 men and women, dressed in black trousers and slacks, white shirts and black ties, lined up along the black-flag draped Andersonstown and Falls roads in west Belfast on Tuesday for the funeral of Bobby Storey.Behind them stood thousands more as the hearse containing the Tricolour-covered coffin of Storey, a senior Sinn Féin and IRA figure for decades, passed by, applauding as it did. Even with the Covid-19 lockdown regulations in place, they were determined to pay tribute to a man they considered a hero.However, there are others who experienced the brutal side of the 64-year-old, who hold sharply different views about the man lauded in Anderstown and the Falls Road.Storey, who died on June 21st after an unsuccessful lung transplant in a National Health Service hospital in England, may be the “most famous Provo” that most people, with no connection to republicanism, have never heard about, or know little about him, if they had.However, “Big Bobby”, as his closest friend for decades, former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, generally called him, never wanted to be known by people at large, just by his own.Within the Sinn Féin and IRA family, he was viewed as a top commander – involved from his youth in the Troubles, with years behind bars, and a place at the top table right up to very recently when illness forced him from the scene.The two people he most admired, as he said himself, were Che Guevara and Gerry Adams. “He was grafted on to Adams,” was one well-put portrayal of their relationship.Studying his history, Storey, who was the IRA’s director of intelligence in the eyes of those who knew that world well, was “a planner, operator and an enforcer”.Illustrating that latter side to him, one former police officer, recalled a beating delivered by Storey to another republican who had dared to challenge the Adams-McGuinness leadership at one of key moments in the peace process.“The man was a repeat murderer, with a penchant for cutting people’s throats, but even he was scared of Bobby Storey,” the former officer recalled.Though he rarely took the microphone outside of speaking to usually-private, sometimes public Sinn Féin gatherings, Storey was able to come up with the memorable quote when he had to go to the front of the stage.One such moment came during a west Belfast press conference in August 2015 attended by Adams, the late Martin McGuinness, Mary Lou McDonald and some other leading republicans.Matters were then fraught. Kevin McGuigan had just been shot dead in Belfast in a revenge murder for the killing of senior IRA figure Gerard “Jock” Davison that May.Storey had been arrested for the McGuigan murder, but released without charge. The killing threatened the already shaky Northern Executive. Storey insisted that the IRA had had nothing to do with it.The then PSNI chief constable George Hamilton had said some IRA members carried out McGuigan’s murder, although they had acted without the authority of the leadership. Storey’s denials were treated with scepticism.“I think the chief constable and other perspectives out there see this in terms of the IRA being the caterpillar that is still there,” waxed Storey. “What I think is that it’s moved on, it’s become a butterfly, it’s flew away, it’s gone, it’s disappeared.”The butterfly metaphor, which prompted a smile from Adams, had the colloquial colour and rhythm of a remark from one who could talk softly because they carried a big stick.Storey was a “made man” in the IRA from his teens. In 1979, when in his early 20s, he was sent to London to try to free the late IRA leader Brian Keenan from Brixton prison using a helicopter.It failed and Storey and three others were arrested. He was acquitted but in 1981 was sentenced to 18 years in prison over a gun attack on British soldiers.That led to the Maze prison escape of 1983 and the beginning of Storey making his way into republican legend. Storey and North Belfast Assembly member Gerry Kelly were two of the masterminds in what was the biggest jailbreak in UK prison history, dubbed by republicans, The Great Escape, after the film. In all 38 IRA prisoners made it out of the prison gates in September 1983, half were recaptured but 19 got away.Storey, too, was caught and had another seven years added to his sentence. Prison officer James Ferris who was stabbed during the escape died, although a court later ruled that it was a heart attack that killed him.Storey in a 2008 interview with the republican paper An Phoblacht recalled the escape. “It was a great achievement for the IRA. It showed the degree to which comrades could work together, not just those who escaped but those who formed the back-up inside the jail, prisoners who weren’t going on the escape. Then there was the teamwork of people outside the jail: the drivers, the safe houses. Even getting captured didn’t dampen the event. We shafted Maggie Thatcher.”Storey probably is best known for the 2004 Northern Bank robbery. Adams and the IRA denied that the IRA did the job, and there are people who accept that denial, but not many.Carried out on December 20th, 2004 at the Northern Bank\u0027s headquarters at\u0026nbspDonegall Square\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspBelfast, Northern Ireland, the robbers seized £26.5 m sterling, along with smaller amounts of other currents - the biggest bank robbery in British history.The families of two Northern Bank officials were held at gunpoint on the night before while they were forced the following morning to report for work, as normal. One of the officials was forced to bring out £1m in cash stuffed into a holdall in a test run for the main robbery later that night. The two officials were forced to grant access to the robbers later that night into the bank, which had huge sums of cash in the vault in readiness to fill ATMs. Following the raid, Northern Bank recalled\u0026nbsp£300m worth of banknotes worth £10 or more, and issued new ones with new logos and new serial numbersThe robbery had been months in the planning, coming shortly after a failed attempt to resurrect the powersharing Executive and Assembly which had collapsed in 2002.Intelligence and security services put Storey at the heart of its planning. “The robbery was carried out by the Belfast brigade, and Storey was a key player in the brigade, so he would have been up to his neck in it,” said a former senior Police Service of Northern Ireland officer.It should be remembered that the IRA was on ceasefire at the time and supposed to have eschewed such criminality. The same source recalled how over the years the IRA engaged in numerous bank, post office and other robberies. When Border fuel laundering and other activity was taken into account it all amounted to a multimillion pound criminal empire.It prompted the late and former IRA member Dolours Price to comment at the time about slipping republican “standards” and to wonder: “The war is over, we are told . . . so what is all this money needed for?”It is a question that has never been properly answered.Storey had been involved in major robberies before. Stung by multiple truck hijackings in the early 2000s Gallaher’s cigarette manufacturers in Ballymena began to ship supplies bound for Dublin first to Liverpool by ferry, and then onwards to Dublin.The change soon drew the attention of the IRA to Gallaher’s use of Belfast port. In a raid in June 2001 that never drew the attention of the Northern Bank robbery, the IRA targeted a £4 million consignment of cigarettes bound for Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The planning was impeccable, even in the words today of security sources. The Belfast brigade of the IRA provided the people, the IRA in south Armagh handled the logistics, while Storey was at the centre of the web.“One night about 30 men appeared in Belfast dock. They took over the entire dock. They knew exactly what they were doing, they knew exactly what containers they were looking for, they knew exactly where those containers would be,” said one source.“The only mistake they made was that they were a little bit late and a couple of those containers were loaded by the time they got to the quayside. So they put a gunman in the cab of the crane with the crane driver and made him unload them again.“A fleet of lorries then appeared provided by the south Armagh brigade. The containers were dropped onto the lorries which headed off for the Border. The IRA held up the dock for another four hours, and then disappeared.“By the time the alarm was raised I reckon some of those cigarettes were almost in Cork. Bobby Storey would have been at the heart of that as well.”If the Gallaher’s raid made few headlines, the Northern Bank raid dominated bulletins across the world. Anxious to keep the IRA on board British prime minister Tony Blair’s “peace train” played down charges that the IRA was responsible for the cigarette job.“But it was absolutely obvious who did it. No organisation in Northern Ireland had the capability to do that job but the IRA,” said one security source involved in the investigation.Then there was the St Patrick’s night break-in in 2002 at the PSNI special branch offices at the Castlereagh police complex in east Belfast, supposedly one of the most impenetrable security centres in Europe. Three smartly-dressed men, one reputedly with an Oxbridge accent, almost casually got through the various checks, flashing what appeared to be genuine security passes.It was a Sunday, a quiet night, and the men walked along the corridors of the building, just as IRA men did in the Belfast docks raid, knowing exactly where they were to go.Within minutes, the three men were in the office where information about police agents, their police handlers and other highly-confidential documentation were kept.They got out with that hoard just as easily as they got in, a lone constable in the office being punched in the face and then hooded, bound and gagged as the three carefully and methodically assembled their haul.Millions of pounds were spent rehousing compromised detectives and others whose security was threatened by the break-in.Highly embarrassed, then chief constable Ronnie Flanagan referred to the Castlereagh raid as “an inside job”, giving rise to speculation that this was some sort of faction fight between the different elements of British intelligence. But it then emerged that Flanagan appeared to be referring to someone in Castlereagh assisting the three well-dressed robbers.The IRA denied involvement while senior Sinn Féiners complained of dirty deeds by “British securocrats”, to use a favourite and much-used phrase of Adams.Whitehall mandarin Sir John Chilcot, who later investigated the causes of the Iraq war, conducted an inquiry and found no evidence that any section of the British security agencies was involved.Once more Storey was blamed. Remembering the raid, a former senior police officer has no doubts but that he was central. However, that same source believes that Storey was criticised internally by at least one Sinn Féin leader who, whatever about the haul of information found at the break-in, was unhappy with its timing because it put pressure on the Northern Executive and Assembly.The then Ulster Unionist Party first minister David Trimble was under severe strain at the time for sharing power with Sinn Féin. Allegations that the on-ceasefire IRA had broken Castlereagh did nothing for his temperament, or his position.Storey was seen as a man who had “sleepers” in many sensitive positions who could be used at opportune times. Storey, this inidual believes, had “an asset” with knowledge of Castlereagh and that he decided to “use that asset, rather than lose it”. Not every element of the republican movement was kept in the loop by a man who kept secrets well.Storey was said to run a meticulous, almost obsessive intelligence gathering operation. Every IRA brigade in Northern Ireland, possibly apart from south Armagh which tended to do its own thing, supplied information to him.He carefully collated and stored it, much of it in a large bag, a “bit like a Gladstone bag”, according to the source. It was described in court as a “rucksack”.“Republicans were reporting back intelligence all the time, picking up information on prison officers, on police officers, taking down car registrations, getting family details, where children went to school, getting gossip about people’s finances, who was having affairs – all of it being fed back to Bobby,” he explained.It was around then, said the same source, that the PSNI devised a plan to bring him down. And here the story gets convoluted but it all leads up to Stormontgate in October of 2002.StormontgateThat month a long line of PSNI special branch and regular officers trooped into the offices of Sinn Féin at Parliament Buildings and seized material. Amid allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont – hence Stormontgate – Trimble could no longer hold his people together and the whole powersharing structure came crashing down, not to be rebuilt for close to another five years – an occasion in which Storey also featured.Sinn Féin’s head of administration at Stormont, Denis Donaldson was arrested, as were two other men, Donaldson’s son-in-law Ciarán Kearney, and William Mackessy. Storey’s “big bag” – stored in Donaldson’s home – was seized during a PSNI raid.They faced a range of charges but gradually some of them were withdrawn. In December 2005, the prosecution case ended, lawyers reporting it was no longer in the “public interest” to proceed with the case – a term that not infrequently is shorthand for protecting undercover sources or agents.The following day, Friday, December 9th, Donaldson posed with Adams and McGuinness on the steps of Parliament Buildings, the three looking rather self-satisfied.That did not last long. The following week a forlorn Donaldson gave a statement to the press admitting that for about 20 years he had acted as a British agent. At Stormont Donaldson came across as a quiet and decent inidual who kept to the background. On that day he appeared pitiful. He went to live a life of isolation in a cottage near Glenties in Co Donegal where he was brutally murdered the following April. One of his arms was almost blown off by a shotgun blast. The Real IRA said it had killed him, but there are still questions over whether that was a genuine admission.The outing of Donaldson allowed Adams and other Sinn Féiners to claim the whole Stormontgate affair was yet another example of a British “securocrat” conspiracy and that there was no republican spying at Stormont.Again some people believe that version of events. The other story, as expressed by a number of security, official and other sources, was that the police were trying to get Storey in possession of that bag of secret documents. Revenge was required for Castlereagh.In fact, said the former PSNI officer, the operation to nab Storey and other senior republicans had run for a long period. It was costly and involved many officers. But they just could not get the bag and Storey together. The PSNI for a long time knew Donaldson had the bag but were hoping for a “pass the parcel” moment when it would be handed over to the IRA director of intelligence.The source explained: “The bag had been left temporarily with Denis Donaldson. It was destined for Bobby and we were trying to catch Bobby with it, with all those intelligence records and CDs, but we couldn’t in the end. Eventually it got to the stage where we ran out of resources and had to move on it and take Denis instead.”One of the explanations for Donaldson’s arrest, even though he was an agent, was that he had not told his handlers about all the secret documentation. Another reason for the police moving in was fear that the material would be transported for safer keeping across the Border.The result was that Storey escaped the net while millions of pounds were spent trying to safeguard the estimated 2,000 or so people, many of them prison, police and British army officers, some of them politicians, named in the documents.The former officer also recalled how police did not get a chance to contact one particular man, an alleged drug dealer, on the list. “He was killed by the IRA, using one of its cover names, before he could be warned.”LoyaltySpeaking after his death, Adams was strong in his tribute to Storey, saying that he was “one of the bravest people I have ever had the honour to know”.“Whether inside or outside of prison, or through the years of harassment and beatings, arrests and torture from the RUC and British army, Big Bobby demonstrated time and time again his enormous personal commitment and courage,” he added.In turn Storey had a fierce loyalty to Adams. In 2014, when Adams was arrested and questioned at Antrim police station for a number of days about the 1972 abduction, murder and secret burial of mother-of-10 Jean McConville, Storey rallied to his cause.“That they would dare touch our party leader, the leader of Irish republicanism,” Storey thundered at a public gathering in west Belfast. At the same meeting Storey repeated a famous line from Adams about the IRA: “We have a message for the British government, for the Irish government, for the cabal that is out there: we ain’t gone away, you know.”During research for this article, several political, security and republican sources have emphasised how critical Storey was to the peace process and strategy pursued by Adams and McGuinness. They provided the strategy, he provided the muscle to ensure they got their way.Following the August 1994 IRA ceasefire, senior Sinn Féiners went to IRA units across Northern Ireland, and in the Republic, to argue for the peace strategy. Encouraged to speak up, a couple of IRA volunteers attending a meeting close to the Markets in central Belfast did so, and expressed their opposition to the ceasefire.“During all of this Bobby sat at the back of the room,” said one well-placed source. “As the crowd were filtering out Bobby took those speakers aside and explained to them in words of one syllable what the consequences would be if they ever challenged the Adams-McGuinness leadership again. Bobby could be vicious, and they knew that.”One very senior security figure was certain that Storey was important in ensuring that those within the IRA and Sinn Féin who opposed Adams and McGuinness never got the upper hand.“We always believed that Bobby Storey was director of intelligence in the late 1990s and early noughties for the IRA,” he said. “He was very much a key player, extremely close to the leadership. His support for them was pretty vital in containing any iniduals within the organisation who were threatening to throw over the traces, because they were all terrified of him.”“I have no doubt that he played a positive role in making sure that any dissent within the organisation was suppressed,” he added.“He would have been fairly free with his fists when he had to. There were many, many people in the organisation who were frightened of him. If he came around and supported the party leadership then there would be very few people who would cross him.”At the funeral Adams quipped that he did not know anyone who knew Storey “who didn’t like him – except for MI5, MI6, the old RUC, the British army, and prison governors”. Still, he was not universally loved, even within republicanism.In addition to those he threatened, there were other Republicans who had little time for Storey. One in particular was former IRA leader Ivor Bell who last year in court was cleared of soliciting McConville’s murder.That case centred on testimony Bell gave on the Boston tapes – the ill-fated oral history of the Troubles – where it was alleged that one night in 1972, Bell, the late Pat McClure and Adams gathered to settle the terrible end of the life of Jean McConville.Adams, who also gave evidence to the court, insisted no such meeting took place and that he had no part in the murder of the 38-year-old widow.But in the tapes, where former IRA man Anthony McIntyre interviewed Bell, mention also is made of Storey. The court heard that when the IRA and Sinn Féin decided to assist in locating the bodies of McConville and others of the Disappeared Adams sent Storey to speak to Bell. This would have been around 1998-1999.Storey’s task, it appeared from the tapes, was to elicit from Bell what he knew about the Disappeared. But it was clear that Bell felt that Adams was being disingenuous, which led to an infuriated Bell describing Storey as a “clown” and an “idiot” – terms that very few people would have used about him.A clearly annoyed Bell said that he told Storey, “What are you asking me about it for, sure my knowledge of it would be second-hand, why don’t you ask Gerry?”“Oh Gerry knows nothing about it,” Storey told Bell with an exasperated Bell saying to McIntyre, “the annoying thing is he actually believed Gerry.”Storey was loved within most of the republican community but as with Bell there were those who despised him.In July 2018, dissident republicans threw explosive devices at the homes of Adams and Storey in West Belfast. No one was injured. A rally there was quickly organised, with Storey telling dissidents they needed to “go back to where they come from”. “They were on a road to nowhere,” was a message he repeated on a number of occasions.YouthFrom teenage years Storey’s whole life was given over to the IRA and Sinn Féin. He joined the IRA when he was 16. Aged 17, he was one of the youngest to be interned in 1973. He served more than 20 years in prison, quite a lot of them on remand on various charges such as IRA shootings and bombings. Several sources said he was implicated in a number of killings but that because he was so long inside that he is rarely linked to some of the even more notorious multiple-death IRA gun and bomb attacks.“Then there was the massacre on Bloody Sunday when 13 people were gunned down . . . The fact that British paratroopers could gun down innocent protesters had a massive impact on me and from that point on I was attempting to join the republican movement.”Through the 2000s and as the IRA, to a relative degree considering the criminality, retreated into the shadows Sinn Féin leaders such as Adams saw the merit of bringing Storey more into the political fold. They tested the waters first by seeing how he would perform. On one occasion The  and other newspapers were invited to an off-the-record briefing where Storey, a little self-effacingly and with some reluctance, offered his thoughts on whatever was the political issue of that day. “I am not used to this,” he said, but then chatted away. There were no other such invitations for sit-down meetings with Storey.Tall, strongly-built, and with a commanding presence, Storey could be affable man, and with a good sense of humour. Equally, it was clear that he was not one to be crossed.His civility did not stretch to all journalists. The Belfast writer and journalist Malachi O’Doherty, who has been a regular critic of Sinn Féin and the IRA, remembers how in the mid-1990s he was tackled by Storey after he had delivered a piece on BBC Radio Ulster’s Talkback programme in which he referred to Storey’s “enforcer” status.Storey was 6ft 5in. O’Doherty is 5ft 2in, or little more. O’Doherty had been attending a lecture in the Felons’ Club in west Belfast when Storey approached him. O’Doherty recalled: “He put me up against a wall and told me I was a slug and not welcome in west Belfast.”“After that incident another journalist went to speak to him and said, ‘Look what’s the score with Malachi?’ And he said, ‘Well, Malachi shouldn’t feel that he is free to just walk into west Belfast given that he has been so critical of us’.”This was not a teasing, semi-jocular act by Storey, says O’Doherty: “Oh, no, it was clear intimidation of a journalist.”Some people have characterised Storey as little more than an IRA hardman who carried out the orders given to him and who could barely think for himself. McIntyre, who spent time in prison with him and who was no friend of the Adams-McGuinness leadership, and who himself took some serious gyp from Storey, strongly contradicts that view.He recalled occasions in prison when inmates were shown films. “I hated sitting beside him because no matter how complicated the plot of the film he’d work it out immediately and ruin it for you,” he said.“He was very competent and very well got. He was absolutely hated by the cops, they absolutely despised him.“He was exceptionally bright. I never found Bobby thuggish or a bully in a personal sense although a whole lot of others did. Whenever he was talking he always carried the authority of the IRA.”“In terms of practical intelligence and practical ability you would meet nobody brighter. People used to say to me, ‘He is stupid’, and I would say back to them, ‘You are stupid for thinking he is stupid’. You don’t put operations like that together if you are stupid.”Journalist Ivan Little while writing about Storey paramilitary past in the Belfast  also had a memory about his “softer” side. “At a talent contest I hosted in west Belfast some years ago he and his mother watched with pride as Storey’s brother Brian who had Down’s syndrome stole the show as an Elvis impersonator,” he recalled.But there are few such anecdotes.Across the Border he was also very well known to senior Garda and Army intelligence officers. “He was certainly on our radar he figured a lot in our intelligence reports down the years, he was an interesting character,” said one former Garda source.And while Storey is seldom mentioned as being on the IRA Army Council a former Army intelligence source said the view in the South was that “he was on the army council, or very close to it”.“Membership of the army council was fluid we think he was on it for a while. Storey was very influential. He mostly stayed behind the scenes but we had him at the very top of the tree,” he said.That 2008 An Phoblacht interview was another example of Storey’s switch from paramilitarism to politics although one security source said that even in his Sinn Féin days “he was somewhere between the two”.He held a senior position for Sinn Féin at Stormont and also served as party chairman for a period. He was a prominent backroom figure at times of political crises and during elections. He could energise the footsoldiers when the vote had to be got out. Perhaps jaundiced by the necessity to deal with journalists it seemed, however, that elected politics was not for him.In his graveside oration Adams spoke about how Storey was devoted to his partner, Teresa, their children, and grandchildren, brothers Seamus and Brian, and sister Geraldine.One of the repeated arguments from senior British security figures and some unionist politicians over the years is that a chief reason for the IRA finally ending its “war” was because it was so riddled with and damaged by informers and agents, some of them operating at very elevated levels such as Donaldson and Freddie Scappaticci, also known as Stakeknife, and some purported high-rankers yet to be exposed.Differing viewsThere are different views of Storey. Most unionists and many others will see him as just another ruthless terrorist who was part of an IRA murder machine that killed up to 1,800 people and badly injured thousands more in an unjustifiable and unnecessary conflict.That view was reflected in a piece in the Belfast  on the day before the funeral by historian Ruth Dudley Edwards which was headlined: “Bobby Storey: a violent thug who played role in the collapse of Stormont on three occasions”.The counter view was offered in that same day’s Irish News where senior republican Jim Gibney wrote: “If it is possible for one inidual to embody the spirit, the dynamic, the duration and durability, the depth and complexity of the republican struggle over the last 45 years then it was Bobby Storey.”But in the often dispassionate warts and all world of the British and Irish intelligence and security services that battled with Storey and his like there remains an objective regard for his nerve and skill.That same former Stormont official had one lasting memory of Storey that acknowledged his place in the republican hierarchy and in the “long war” tussle between the competing forces. It was May 2007, two months after Adams and Ian Paisley after much coaxing from the British and Irish governments, struck their truly historic deal to restore the Northern Executive and Assembly. This was after close to five years of direct rule from Westminster and now finally powersharing was being reinstated.While below in the chamber the politicians went about the business of formally reactivating the Executive and Assembly, in the visitors’ gallery above the likes of taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Blair and other VIPs observed proceedings, enjoying some of the reflected light of a job well done.Just a few seats from them sat three of the most senior IRA figures of the Troubles, the late Brian Keenan, Brian Gillen and Bobby Storey.“This is how central he was to PIRA and also to the peace process – while it would have infuriated unionists, their presence was a vindication of the Adams strategy and the peace process,” said the former official.He said that Blair and some of the other dignitaries “probably wouldn’t have recognised Storey anyway, which again says something about him”.And in a neat encapsulation of Storey’s significant but in many way reticent place in republican history and in the peace process he added: “He was very low profile, as befits an intelligence person – he was an observer.“But I do remember the respect my intelligence colleagues had for his operations. Quite apart from the Maze breakout to have planned the Northern Bank robbery and the Castlereagh break-in was extraordinary: respectively one of the largest bank robberies in history and the single biggest breach of UK national security ever. Quite a CV and he certainly didn’t lack ambition.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294758.1593707527!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"carbon emissions in ireland to drop 9 5 this year due to coronavirus slowdown","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBased on current trajectories, Ireland will fail to meet key 2030 targets on reducing CO2, according to an ESRI analysis. Photograph: iStockEconomy-wide CO2 emissions are expected to decrease by 9.5 per cent this year arising from the coronavirus pandemic, according to analysis by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).However, it warns “this reduction is short-lived as the low current energy prices increase energy demand and emissions rise again in 2021”. Based on current trajectories, Ireland will fail to meet key 2030 targets on reducing CO2, it adds.In a separate economic analysis it concludes Irish GDP is expected to decrease by about 13 per cent in 2020 as a result of economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus crisis. With stimulus measures, “household disposable income will decrease by 8 per cent on average, where rural households are still hit the hardest”, the ESRI predicts.The results come from research applying the ESRI’s environment, energy and economy model for Ireland known as 13E.Financial crashThis study incorporates recent changes in the structure of the economy due to Covid-19 and recent international energy price movements. The model considers different production sectors, carbon inputs and emissions.The 9.5 per cent annual cut in emissions is the largest since the 2008 financial crash. Other predictions by climate scientists suggest a short-lived cut of 6 to 7 per cent was likely this year. The new Government target is a yearly reduction of 7 per cent averaged up to 2030.Though initially emissions will fall due to the economic downturn, in the medium-to-long term lower energy prices will lead to an increase in energy demand, and hence an increase in emissions as restrictions are lifted, the ESRI said. “This will lead to a failure to meet the Irish EU legally-binding emissions targets in 2030.”Report co-author Dr Kelly de Bruin said “though the economic impacts of the Covid crisis are severe . . . we do not expect large emissions reduction as seen during the financial crisis of 2008.Environmental challenges“Ireland would still need to put in considerable effort to reach its EU emission goals. The results underline the importance of having a well-designed Government response policy package, which considers the unique economic and environmental challenges presented by the Covid-19 crisis.”The research, funded by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, examines the coronavirus-related production shutdown in specific sectors, changes in consumption habits due to restrictions, declining labour force participation, trade impacts and the Government’s initial response.“Each of these changes impacts the economy, where it is found that the largest impact comes from the production side. This work assumes that the economic structure of the Irish economy will recover in 2021,” the report said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Beijing enraged at plan to help up to 3m residents in fallout over national security lawAt least nine charged under Chinese law that critics say strips Hong Kong of rights and freedomsLaw will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusionHot and bothered commuters refuse to wear masks on public transportTesting blitz as recent jump in infections in Australia stokes fears of second waveHistoric move will allow authorities to crack down on subversive and secessionist activityRisks of viruses crossing species barrier into humans in densely populated regions highlightedWashington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4294705.1593704218!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"putin pledges to repay russians trust after triumphant vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRussian president Vladimir Putin: “We need internal stability and time to strengthen the country and all its institutions,” he said, admitting that Russia had “many unresolved problems”. Photograph: Alexei DruzhininSputnikAFP via Getty ImagesPresident Vladimir Putin has thanked Russians for their “support and trust” and pledged to use it to develop and strengthen the country, after a vote decried by critics as a farce opened the door for him to remain in power until 2036.Officials said 78 per cent of voters backed a host of constitutional amendments, including one that allows Mr Putin to run for another two six-year terms when his current mandate ends in 2024. He has already ruled Russia as president or prime minister for 20 years and would be 83 years old in 2036.Turnout was officially 68 per cent over seven days of voting that ended on Wednesday, when partial results were announced several hours before polling stations closed, adding more fuel to the anger of critics who called the plebiscite a sham staged by the Kremlin to further tighten Mr Putin’s grip on power.Mr Putin did not mention the “reset” of his term limits on Thursday, but focused on other changes that he said would benefit Russians.“Here we have both the improvement of the political system and the consolidation of social guarantees. Here is the strengthening of sovereignty, territorial integrity. Finally, our spiritual, historical, moral values that bind generations together,” he said in a televised address.The amendments ban gay marriage, enshrine a “patriotic” view of the nation’s history and outlaw the relinquishing of any territory, six years after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine. ‘Formative stage’Mr Putin argued that Russia was still “in the formative stage” following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and remained “very vulnerable in many ways”.“We need internal stability and time to strengthen the country and all its institutions,” he said, admitting that Russia had “many unresolved problems”.Leaders at all levels must “act quicker, more accurately and in a more organised and effective way” and “do everything to justify people’s great trust”, he added.At the same time, Mr Putin’s allies described the vote as a huge personal victory for a man who has already ruled for longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. “In essence, it was de facto a triumphant referendum on trust in president Putin,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. He also denied allegations that the vote was massively rigged, insisting that it was in fact notable for its “absolute cleanness and transparency”.Polling stations popped up in a host of unlikely and unmonitored locations, from stairwells to park benches to the boot of a car, and people were encouraged to vote with prize draws that were only open to those who had cast a ballot. There were also widespread reports of state employees being pressured to vote and people voting more than once.‘Attack on sovereignty’Independent monitoring group Golos said the event “will go down in the history of the country as an example of an attack on the sovereignty of the people”.Mr Putin says he has not decided whether to seek another term, but warned that failure to make that option available would lead to instability as elements of government started “looking around for possible successors”.“The vote is an attempt to obtain a certificate of public trust that Putin can thrust in the faces of the elites, who are the real source of his worries,” Tatiana Stanovaya, non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, wrote recently.“This fear that the elites will start searching for a successor instead of working as usual explains Putin’s desire to reconfigure his relationship with them . . . The referendum was intended by Putin as a way to renew his political mandate in order to impose decisions on the elite, but its legitimacy is dubious.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4293753.1593626392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"world look away now these are dark days for the united states","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tParticipants in a Black Lives Matter protest  in  Trafalgar Square, London. ‘The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.’ Photograph: Niklas HallenEPAAt its midpoint, 2020 is turning out to be one of the darkest years in the peacetime history of the US. It has also affirmed the nation’s global primacy beyond any doubt. Fear not for your columnist’s grip on logical reasoning, at least any more than usual. These contrary claims are reconcilable.The first comes from a mere glance at the facts. The US accounts for a quarter of the world’s recorded deaths from Covid-19. Its people are ignominiously barred from entry to the EU and other allied territories. Unemployment is at its highest rate for a human lifetime. The killing of George Floyd has exposed racial inequities and highlighted once more a homicide rate that marks America out among rich countries.Even if the Depression was more acutely harrowing, there was no pandemic and, from 1933, people had Franklin Roosevelt to lead them, not a thrown, lost-looking Donald Trump. On that point, with the logistical test of a presidential election still ahead, the year has ample room to get worse.Compounding these traumas is intense scrutiny from the rest of the world. And so to the second claim. The US is the only nation today whose domestic failings could set off vast protests in other continents.For all its heft, China does not draw young Europeans to the streets on behalf of Uighurs or the cause of democracy in Hong Kong. At least not in such awesome numbers. It took the Floyd killing at the hands of police to do that. And, while the US has botched its response to the coronavirus pandemic, other countries with dismal records (namely Britain) escape without the same volume or tenor of foreign coverage.Such exposure was the price America once paid for its overwhelming superiority in economic scale and military potential. It was a tax on world leadership and, as such, eminently affordable. With China’s gains in both gross domestic product and armaments, however, even this consolation no longer applies.The US, then, finds itself in the worst of all possible worlds. Its external power and internal cohesion are manifestly in decline. Its psychic hold on the rest of humanity is not. The result is a level of scrutiny that no other nation, not even the other superpower, has to experience – or, perhaps, could withstand. The tighter the inspection, the more numerous the revealed flaws, and the more compromised is America’s ability to command global deference.ObsessionThe whole process is viciously circular. What is a boon for a Washington correspondent – everyone, everywhere has an opinion on the US – can be a bane for Americans themselves.As the tussle develops, China’s obvious advantages over the US include a four-times-larger population and a one-party system’s ability to plan long-term. But a less discussed one is the world’s lower level of obsession with it, for now. This is more often framed as a liability: a lack of soft power, of cultural magnetism, compared with the land of Netflix and all-conquering pop stars. But the corollary is greater freedom from outside invigilation.A discreet rise is what China is said to have achieved over recent decades. The US is condemned to the exact opposite: to wane in public, like an actor who no longer commands the plum roles but remains hounded by paparazzi. Its crimes and mistakes are still aired like no other nation’s.It was natural that America held the world rapt when that world was unipolar. That it continues to do so in 2020 needs some explaining. One reason is the country’s relative openness to media coverage. Another, reinforcing the first, is the English language: it is easier for the average European (or Australian or Nigerian) to follow US public life than China’s.Yet a third reason, it has to be said, is America’s self-image as a standard bearer for the species. Claim city-on-a-hill status, and cynics will comb the city for blemishes and signs of subsidence, even if they do so with tasteless relish or with great hypocrisy. Trump, a raw nationalist, tends to avoid talk of the US as a moral experiment on behalf of mankind. His successors should retain this if no other feature of his presidency.This week, the UK government named some policies after Roosevelt’s New Deal, a now almost 90-year-old programme of disputed effectiveness undertaken in different circumstances in a different continent. The way the US continues to serve as a reference point is impressive. It is a vestigial mark of its time as a truly unchallenged power. But it comes at the cost of painful exposure.The world is moving on from American hegemony. It is not moving on from the American spectacle. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Read more about the Donald Trump administrationStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"charts countries covid 19 showing no sign slowing","story":"More than 10m cases of Covid-19 have now been reported across the world, and cases are back on the rise in regions which face the prospect of renewed local lockdowns.Over the past week, the number of new cases reported each day has been above 150,000, and 60 per cent of all cases have been reported in the last month.Cases are rising in multiple American states, and 300,000 people in Melbourne have been issued stay at home orders after a resurgence of the virus.While cases are in decline across much of Europe, the virus\u0027 grip on countries across the world is tightening and showing no signs of slowing down.According to the latest data, countries where Covid-19 cases are on the rise include the United States, South Africa, Colombia and the Palestinian territories.The rate of new cases in South Africa is approaching the same level as the United States, with 114 cases per million people, on average, in the week to June 1.Across the USA the average rate of daily new cases has now reached 131 per million - surpassing its previous peak of 96.In Palestine, the rate of new daily cases has doubled in little more than a week, from 19 per million to 42 per million. “Flare-ups are to be expected as countries start to lift restrictions,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation on Wednesday.“But countries that have the systems in place to apply a comprehensive approach should be able to contain these flare-ups locally and avoid reintroducing widespread restrictions.“However, we are concerned that some countries have not used all the tools at their disposal and have taken a fragmented approach.“But one of the lessons of the pandemic is that no matter what situation a country is in, it can be turned around. It’s never too late.”The pandemic is continuing to rise across the Americas and Asia, with worrying trends emerging in Africa.North America accounted for 30 per cent of all new Covid-19 cases on June 30, with 25 per cent in South America and 27 per cent in Asia.After being declared the epicentre of the virus in March, cases have trailed off in Europe, which now accounts for fewer than one in ten new cases across the globe. The second wave emerging in the US is not being driven by outbreaks in all of the nation\u0027s 50 states, however.Some - most notably New York - have seen infections drop off compared to the huge peaks of March and April.The state was seeing over 10,000 new cases per day at the pandemic\u0027s peak, but is now down to 600 daily infections.Instead Florida, Texas and California are among a new group of states facing the brunt of the pandemic, as over three quarters of states still face a week-on-week increase in the number of new Covid-19 infections.These three states alone accounted for nearly half of the US\u0027s quarter of a million cases confirmed last week.Renewed infections has forced several governors to back out of an initial easing of lockdown measures.Texas governor Greg Abbott, who previously ordered bars in the state to reopen, warned on Monday that America\u0027s experience of the global pandemic was taking a \u0027very swift and very dangerous turn.A total of 39 states have seen week on week rises in new daily cases.Across the Pacific, Australian health officials are grappling with a surge in cases in Melbourne, with authorities issuing stay at home orders in 36 suburbs across ten postcodes in the city today.Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews has blamed extended family gatherings and violations of hotel quarantines for the region\u0027s alarming spike in new infections, which totaled over 250 last week.This contrasts with the situation in Australia\u0027s other provinces, including New South Wales, home of Sydney, which has seen its previously dramatic infection rate level off.  The province saw just 33 new cases last week, compared to around 1,122 in the last week of March, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"china hints tough action stop hong kong residents leaving uk","story":"Wendy Tang, Nicola Smith and Danielle SheridanChina yesterday raised the prospect of preventing Hong Kong citizens from taking up British residency as it upped the diplomatic ante after the UK gave the right to almost three million of them to move there permanently over Beijing’s introduction of its draconian national security law there.  In fiercely worded comments, China strongly condemned Foreign Secretary Dominic Rabb’s offer, which came after almost 400 arrests at pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong on Wednesday, ten of them under the new law. Beijing warned of a backlash.The law, rushed through in secrecy on Tuesday night introduced life sentences or long prison terms for vaguely defined crimes linked to secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. It sparked instant international condemnation.Chinese foreign affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters: “China reaffirms that Hong Kong affairs are purely China\u0027s internal affairs and no foreign country has the right to interfere. The Chinese government is firmly determined to safeguard China\u0027s sovereignty, security and development interests.He added that China “reserves the right to take further corresponding measures, and the UK shall bear all consequences arising from this.” Asked to specify what he meant, he said: “Please wait patiently. It is not the right timing yet”.One diplomat with 22 years experience of working in and around China wondered if that might involve forcing all those trying to leave Hong Kong to fill in departure forms, and denying permission to fly. But that would really be to trash the joint declaration, said Charles Parton, senior associate fellow at RUSI. Similar speculation was running on social media yesterday. Lijian also took aim at Australia after it said it too was making plans to offer Hong Kong citizens sanctuary, and at the US, as the House of Representatives backed sanctions against China. That would hit banks like HSBC, because it supported the law’s introduction. As Boris Johnson accused China of “plainly an unacceptable breach” of Hong Kong’s freedoms under the ‘one country, two systems’ agreement when the colony was handed back in 1997, Downing Street indicated sanctions were under consideration. Such a move is backed by Tory MPs including Tobias Ellwood, chair of the defence select committee, and former leader Iain Duncan Smith.Mr Johnson made clear that the row could damage Chinese tech firm Huawei’s controversial involvement in the 5G network. He told The London Evening Standard: “I don’t want to see our critical national infrastructure at risk of being in any way controlled by potentially hostile state vendors. So we have to think very carefully about how to proceed now.” Sir Iain called on the Government to launch a review into how to end the UK\u0027s dependency on China as soon as Monday. It\u0027s not just about sanctions, he told The Daily . The free world has got to come together and do this, otherwise china will just pick people off one after another, we have to work and come together. Humming and harring, hesitating, is not the order of the day. They must now lead this.He added that China needed to be eradicated from secure areas and added that the Number one target is Huawei. It\u0027s over for them and they should know it. Taiwan on Tuesday instructed its citizens to avoid travelling to Hong Kong, Macau or China. Australia was also advising its citizens to avoid the area, telling them that it was possible to break the new without even knowing it, but that that could still lead to life imprisonment. Britain was keeping its travel advice under review, the Foreign Office said. After news the law was coming, Hong Kong agencies were reporting a big increase in inquiries. That is now expected to gather pace.Tina Cheng at Midland Immigration Consultancy told the Financial Times that the agency received 800 inquiries in May, double the one-month peak of 400 during 2019. “It was almost like a tsunami,” she said. A 24-year-old man was hauled off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong to London close to midnight on Wednesday after a police officer was stabbed in the arm during the earlier protests. He had arrived at the airport without luggage, and was the only passenger to have bought his ticket that day.And Nathan Law, one of Hong Kong\u0027s most prominent young democracy activists, announced yesterday he had fled overseas over the sweeping security law. He refused to say where he was, but said he would continue his advocacy work.The revelation Law had left the city came as it emerged a popular protest slogan used over the last year was now illegal under Beijing\u0027s new law. Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times has become a clarion call for pro-democracy protesters over the last year, chanted by huge crowds and plastered on banners.In a statement, Hong Kong\u0027s government said the phrase was now illegal because it contains the indications of Hong Kong independence, or alienating Hong Kong from China, or changing its legal status, or subverting the state The revelation is confirmation that certain peaceful political views have become illegal since the law came into effect Tuesday night.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"david starkey could lose cambridge fellowship no damn blacks","story":"David Starkey, the historian, could have his honorary fellowship of a Cambridge college withdrawn for saying there are “so many damn blacks” in Britain and Africa.He made the comments during an online discussion about slavery, in which he dismissed “the idea that slavery is this kind of terrible disease that dare not speak its name”.Starkey told a Right-wing website: “Slavery was not genocide. Otherwise there wouldn’t be so many damn blacks in Africa or in Britain, would there? An awful lot of them survived.”In response, Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, released a statement that said: “Fitzwilliam College does not tolerate racism. We support and promote freedom of speech in our academic community, but we have zero tolerance of racism. Dr David Starkey’s recent comments on slavery are indefensible.“Fitzwilliam was founded upon values of fairness and mutual respect and we are proud of the College’s inclusive and erse membership.“The matter of Dr Starkey’s Honorary Fellowship will be considered by the Governing Body at its meeting next Wednesday.”His remarks were also condemned by Sajid Javid, the former Home Secretary, who said: “We are the most successful multi-racial democracy in the world and have much to be proud of. But David Starkey’s racist comments (‘so many damn blacks’) are a reminder of the appalling views that still exist.”Prof Kate Williams, a fellow historian who has appeared on panels alongside Starkey, said: “If he gets lots of work after saying that slavery was not genocide because there are ‘so many damn blacks in Africa’ we will all know what’s going on in this society.”This is not the first time that Starkey has made controversial comments on race. In 2011, he told the BBC’s Newsnight programme during a discussion about race riots: “What has happened is that a substantial section of the chavs… have become black.”That prompted more than 100 historians to sign an open letter asking that the BBC stop referring to Starkey as a “historian” on anything but his specialist subject, the Tudors, claiming he was “ill-fitted” to hold forth on other topics.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"finlands air force drops swastika emblem century use","story":"Finland’s air force has quietly removed the last swastikas from unit emblems after over a century in use.Until recently the country’s Air Force Command emblem depicted a pair of wings around a swastika, a symbol which pre-dates its associations with Nazism.The change was first observed by Teivo Teivainen, a politics professor at the University of Helsinki, who argued its negative associations made the swastika\u0027s ongoing use politically fraught.Professor Teivainen, who has written widely on the issue, said using the swastika could cause difficulties for the Nato country, particularly if worn on the uniforms of deployed personnel. “I have not found many reasonable arguments to support its military usefulness,” Mr Teivainen wrote on Twitter on Thursday.The symbol’s association with Finland’s air force dates to its founding in 1918, when Swedish count Eric von Rosen donated a plane painted with swastikas to the newly independent country. The German Nazi Party adopted the swastika as its logo in 1920. Finland removed the swastika from its aircraft following a postwar armistice with the Soviet Union, but until recently the symbol remained on Air Force Command emblems and some flags and decorations. A spokesman for Finland’s air force told the BBC, as unit emblems are worn on uniform, it was considered impractical and unnecessary to continue using the old unit emblem, which had caused misunderstandings from time to time. The current emblem of the air force is a circle of wings around a golden eagle, another symbol used by the force since 1945.Professor Teivainen has coined a phrase in Finnish to explain how the use of a swastika could be problematic despite its innocent origin. Roughly translated, visuaalinen natsahtavuusaste means how much something exhibits visual cues that are associated with Nazis.“This is not a question about manipulating historical records by removing controversial symbols such as the swastika from museums or history books,” he wrote in 2016. “This is about the way the Republic of Finland wants to present its armed forces today.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"raffles ballot stuffing brute forcehow vote keep putin power","story":"Voting at a playground and out of the boot of a car, over the last week the Kremlin has employed myriad ways to hold a nationwide vote allowing Vladimir Putin to stay in power in 2036.Mr Putin, who has ruled Russia for 20 years, would have been forced to step down when his current term in office ends in 2024.However, constitutional changes that he floated earlier this year re-set the clock on term limits for the sitting president.Voting on the amendments is not covered by Russia’s strict, if not always enforceable election laws, so the Kremlin came up with new, lax rules.Worried about delaying the vote, election authorities allowed the voting to be held in the space of a week and in outdoor settings.Social media was flooded with photos and videos of election officials, all  in full hospital-style PPE, leisurely handing out the ballots at playgrounds, on tree stumps, next to a drinking party on a bench and even out of the boot of a car. So many pictures of people using tree stumps were posted that they became a meme. Many election observers and journalists don’t appear to have quite as much fun.Journalist David Frenkel\u0027s arm was broken by a police officer after he arrived at a polling station to check reports of vote-rigging.The polling station’s chairman later insisted that the man fell down and injured himself.In the city of Saratov on the Volga River, election observers saw two neat piles of ballot papers sitting on top of scattered papers in a transparent box at a local polling station, prompting accusations of ballot stuffing. Desperate for a high turnout, which potentially makes it easier to rig the results, regional authorities lured voters to polling stations with the promises of raffles and prizes.The oil-rich Yamal-Nenetsk district was offering smartphones and laptops to lucky winners.In Siberia’s city of Omsk, an election commission member happened to win an apartment. The retail union that organised the raffle explained to the Tass news agency that the woman was simply lucky.In Moscow, where voters are entered the Million of Prizes raffle, Mr Putin is reported to have received his free badge, wrist-band, pen, pocket calendar and a scratch card for the lottery.Early results were also released, contrary to usual rules, infuriating some officials. Ella Pamfilova, Central Election Commission chief, earlier this week criticised Russian state-owned pollster for publishing exit poll results before the voting was over, but lamented the lack of legal means to stop that.Two days later, Ms Pamfilova gave the green light to releasing early voting results from the Far East, more than five hours before the voting would end in Russia’s west.Many Kremlin critics have said that the devil-may-care attitudes of election officials have left ample room for skewing the results in Mr Putin’s favour.At-home voting was not restricted, and was cited a major risk for multiple voting.Mikhail Baturin, a member of a local election commission in Moscow, raised the alarm on the final election day on Wednesday after he saw that at least 30 out of 430 at-home voters marked down in the log book as those who voted at the polling station.“There are no procedures, and no one even bothered to follow any rules,” Mr Baturin, who managed to get the commission to cancel the at-home votes, told The  “This is really funny,” he said, when asked about the official results.The ballot count at his precinct showed a 52 percent vote against Mr Putin’s amendments.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"speaking tests scrapped gcse french pared back exams","story":"Pupils will be able to get a GCSE in French, German or Spanish without being formally tested on their spoken language skills, under plans to slim down courses after students missed months of school during lockdown.Next summer, the oral component of modern foreign languages exams – which makes up 25 per cent of the grade – will be axed and pupils will instead receive a “teacher endorsement”.Ofqual, the exam watchdog, explained in its consultation document: “We have heard from teachers that the recording takes time to arrange and manage.” Rather than pupils being formally examined on verbal skills, a teacher would informally assess them. This would be “more comfortable” for students, the regulator added.It is just one of the sweeping changes made to next year’s GCSE exams, which also include stopping science experiments, cancelling geography field trips and axing parts of the history course.But Dr Tony Breslin, a former chief examiner, said that removing orals from language exams was “like removing numbers from maths”.He told The  that chopping off parts of the syllabus was a “crude” approach, adding: “It feels a bit slash and burn.” Dr Breslin, a former chief examiner for GCSEs and a chairman of examiners for A-levels, said he was concerned that reducing the course would “affect the integrity of the qualification as a whole”.For pupils sitting GCSEs next summer, a series of history topics will become optional rather than compulsory under the proposals, meaning courses are shortened by up to 20 per cent.The regulator said this would give teachers more time to get through the syllabus, adding that it was the “fairest way” to ensure pupils were not placed at a disadvantage when taking exams.However, Alan Sked, emeritus professor of history at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said he was against any “diminution” of the discipline. He said “cutting out half the curriculum” was not the best way to make up for lost time. “Once it’s gone, it’s gone and you can’t make it up again the children won’t get the opportunity to catch up on those parts of history,” he added.Ofqual also proposed physics, biology and chemistry GCSEs would have experiments axed, and instead pupils would observe teachers doing practical work. Rather than using tools, design and technology students would watch teachers demonstrate them.Music students will not be required to perform in an ensemble, while dance students will be examined based on two solo performances, rather than one solo and one quartet. PE students will only be examined on solo pursuits.Ofqual proposed delaying exams until June, meaning they would likely run into July, and results days, usually in mid-August, may be pushed back.The former head of Ucas has warned that delaying 2021 A-levels will wreak havoc on university admissions and will favour privileged students.Mary Curnock-Cook said that moving exams back by a month would mean results day and the clearing process would be delayed into September, meaning teachers would not have time to advise students on their next steps.Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, said: “The range of measures proposed by Ofqual, including the possible short delay to the exam timetable and subject-specific changes to reduce pressure on teaching time, will further ensure those young people taking exams next year have the same opportunities to progress as the students before them.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarkets stop selling coconut products emerges harvested","story":"Supermarkets have stopped selling coconut water and milk from certain companies after it emerged that the products were harvested using \u0027monkey slave labour\u0027.Waitrose has vowed never to sell items obtained through monkey labour after an investigation showed that popular brands were using the animal. The supermarket will thoroughly check its coconut products to ensure they are not harvested by monkeys.Animal rights organisations have spoken out against the Thai farms which use the pigtailed macaques, often snatched from the wild, to scurry up trees and harvest coconuts. They are often forced to carry items larger than their body weight, and kept in tiny cages when not at work.The primates are prized for their work, as a male monkey can collect an average of 1,600 coconuts per day and a female can get 600, while a human can only collect around 80 per day.“Waitrose \u0026amp Partners supports Peta’s goal to end the use of monkey labour in the coconut industry. As part of our animal welfare policy we have committed to never knowingly sell any products sourced from monkey labour,” said John Gregson, the communications manager for Health \u0026amp Agriculture at Waitrose \u0026amp Partners  Morrisons has removed the Thai brands from its shelves, and Boots, the Co-op and Ocado vowed they will not sell products that use monkey labour.The investigation, by animal rights organisation Peta Asia, found farms training monkeys to pick coconuts from trees. Multiple locations were suppliers of leading international coconut product providers, including two of the largest coconut brands. Investigators documented monkeys displaying \u0027stereotypic repetitive behaviour\u0027, indicative of extreme stress. Monkeys were also chained to old tires surrounded by rubbish or confined to cages barely larger than their own bodies and left in the pouring rain without shelter.   To avoid handlers being bitten, the monkeys also often have their teeth pulled out.  These curious, highly intelligent animals are denied psychological stimulation, companionship, freedom, and everything else that would make their lives worth living, all so that they can be used to gather coconuts, says Peta Director Elisa Allen. Peta is calling on decent people never to support the use of enslaved monkeys by shunning coconut products from Thailand.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/06/24/16/coronavirus-lockdown-internet-use.jpg","title":"coronavirus internet use uk lockdown facebook google","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Lockdown\u0026nbspmay leave a lasting digital legacy,\u0027 says Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and researchPeople in the UK have been spending record amounts of time on the internet during the coronavirus lockdown, new data has revealed.In April 2020, UK adults spent longer than four hours online each day – more than a quarter of their waking life.It marks an increase of more than half an hour since January and means people now spend substantially more time online than watching television or listening to the radio.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe figures were revealed in Ofcom’s Online Nation report, which detailed the habits and trends of internet users between November 2019 and April 2020.People aged 18 to 24 were the most heavy users, clocking an average of more than five hours spent online per day.A large portion of the study focussed on internet habits in 2019, which revealed that technology giants now control an even greater share of internet traffic.The research by the regulator showed that more than a third of time spent online was spent on sites owned by either Facebook or Google.The shift towards platforms like Facebook-owned WhatsApp and Messenger appears to have been accelerated during lockdown, with nearly half of all adults using the messaging apps to make video calls at least once a week.Data shows Trump is wrong about US doing more Covid-19 testingOfcom\u0027s research found that the use of video calling services doubled to 70 per cent of the population during the lockdown, as people sought new ways to stay in touch.One of the biggest benefiters from this trend has been the app Zoom, which saw a huge surge in new users at the start of the lockdown.Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy, said Yij-Choung Teh, Ofcom\u0027s director of strategy and research.Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Dozens of shifts at one of the government’s coronavirus mega-labs have been cancelled and staff paid to stay away because of a lack of test samples, a whistleblower has revealed.A member of staff at the Alderley Park Lighthouse Laboratory has shared a tranche of emails sent from lab bosses to staff during May and June with The Independent.They show more than 40 separate shifts at the labs were cancelled in the past two months, often with just a day’s notice or less.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesJeremy Hunt, former health secretary and chair of the Commons health select committee, said he thought it was “extraordinary” the labs were not being fully utilised.There have been widespread calls to increase testing and earlier this week the chief executive of NHS England Sir Simon Stevens told MPs he wanted to see “a significant further increase in testing capacity”.Saffron Cordery, from NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said: “The last thing we want at the moment is to have testing capacity sitting idle. If that is the case it must be addressed as quickly as possible.“We have consistently called for regular, routine testing for health and care staff as part of a clear test and trace strategy. Ideally the NHS would regularly test all staff and patients, irrespective of whether they showed symptoms or not. “The medical and scientific advice is that regular testing is needed at least twice a week to be effective.”The insider, who contacted The Independent after reading our in-depth investigation of the mega-labs earlier this week, said: “The Alderley Park Lighthouse Labs have had an ongoing issue with entire shifts being cancelled due to not enough samples. Approximately 50 per cent of my shifts in May and June were cancelled. They still pay us for this time, but the open cheque seemingly given to these labs by the Department of Health does not seem like an appropriate use of taxpayers’ money.”They shared messages sent to staff which warned them against speaking to journalists or sharing information about the cancellation of shifts but which separately encouraged workers to use social media to post positive and supportive messages about the labs and their work. The guidance also included examples of the “right kind” of messages staff should post.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I feel quite uncomfortable working there, to be honest, and if I’d known it was run by a private company before I’d joined, I’m not sure I would have signed up.”The revelations come as the latest data from the NHS test and trace service show it is failing to reach a quarter of those tested positive by the labs.Mr Hunt, who has called for mass testing of NHS and care staff after it emerged hospitals were a major source of infection, said: “Today’s figures show we are still struggling to get the large majority of new coronavirus infections into the test and trace system.“When the Lighthouse laboratories have so much spare capacity it seems extraordinary we are not rolling out routine testing for parts of the population at highest risk such as frontline health and care staff.”What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyThe problem of not enough samples to test has been a persistent issue at the lab in Alderley Park since the beginning of May. On 19 May Peter Simpson, site director for the labs, emailed staff to say the widening of testing for anyone with symptoms would increase demand and keep the labs busy, but the emails show shifts have continued to be cancelled regularly throughout May and June.He added: “Following discussions, I now have confirmation from the Office of Life Sciences that you shall be fully paid for shifts we allocate to you and that we subsequently cancel or curtail, because of a lack of swab numbers, or due to other matters outside our control. I also have confirmation that this will also apply retrospectively for those where we have cancelled in the past weeks.”On 12 June, Sally Price, head of cell and translational science, emailed workers saying: “As many of you have seen, we have again had several days where sample numbers have been much lower than our capacity. Whilst the numbers of people going for testing are beyond our control, we have been working hard to secure a stronger supply of samples and as a result of which we are now expecting to process more home test kits. We hope that there will be fewer cancelled shifts as a result of this.“Until the swabbing centres report daily attendance it is impossible for us to guarantee the number of samples that will arrive so some unpredictability will remain.”The insider said staff were reminded on an almost weekly basis not to talk to journalists.But social media guidance sent to staff said: “We encourage staff at the Lighthouse Labs to share their experiences working at the Labs on social media. What are you enjoying about working here, what are you proud of, what has been most memorable – let people know!”It included examples of the type of messages they could consider posting.Medicine Discovery Catapult Ltd, a not for profit private company which runs the lab, said it had been inspected by both NHS and the Health and Safety Executive which had raised no concerns about clothing and it followed advice at all times from clinical advisors.It insisted staff were trained fully on the work they were doing with Covid-19 samples.The insider also described a lack of incident reporting processes and detailed an incident where they say one worker cut their glove while virus samples were being opened and this was never reported.MDC told The Independent there was a clear incident reporting process that staff were required to review and sign before working in the lab.MDC added: “On some days the number of swab samples delivered is below the lab capacity, so we need to cancel shifts for some or all staff on those specific shifts. When this occurs, we clearly communicate the reasons to the staff involved.“We value the commitment of our workforce and therefore have a policy that if staff are scheduled on a shift which we need to cancel, they are paid for that shift, as it is the right thing to do.”Regarding the claims of the whistleblower, a spokesperson added: “This inidual has to the best of our knowledge never raised any of these concerns internally. There is a clear mechanism to raise concerns with management, which is explained to all new starters at their induction. We routinely encourage feedback from all our staff.”It added that it had made no profit from the Covid-19 testing work.The Department of Health and Social Care said: “The Lighthouse labs were created at the same time existing NHS England or PHE lab capacity was expanded, which allowed NHS capacity to be reserved to test patients and NHS staff while testing eligibility was broadened out through the Lighthouse labs.“As the daily stats show demand fluctuates throughout the week. Extra capacity ensures we have what we need to respond to local outbreaks and continue with vital surveillance studies.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece!

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It has been called Super Saturday – when pubs across England are set to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown started in March.Tens of thousands of people are expected to head out for a long-awaited pint this weekend as restrictions are finally lifted.However, while many landlords and owners are hoping for some much-needed days of brisk business, some will delay reopening amid concerns of alcohol-fuelled mayhem, and fears that they will not be able to enforce social distancing or keep on top of strict cleaning rotas during the expected flood of partying punters.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“People haven’t been to the pub for three months and now they’re finally getting to go after all that time,” said Heather Griffin, manager of Sheffield’s independently owned Rutland Arms. “It’s not hard to imagine what that might end up being like.”Brits to spend £210m in pubs this weekend as they reopenShe said she will not open for at least another week.“Everything is going to be completely different for pubs – table service, social distancing, constant cleaning – and it’s easier for staff to figure that out on a Monday afternoon, for instance, than it would be on a Saturday evening when people are more likely to be drinking more,” she said. “It will be a lot easier with sober customers.”It is a stance also being taken by Sunderland’s Ttonic, Chaplins, The Point and Arizona bars.In a statement posted online, managers said that the “mass gatherings and intensity expected on Saturday isn’t worth putting our team under unnecessary risk and stress”.They added: “We have been working hard getting our venue up to speed with all the safety measures in place including reviewing the capacity and what our customer journey will look like ... We will not be opening until further notice and remain closed this weekend. Please understand our decision. We must protect our staff and the people in our city.”Treasury officials draw up plans to protect economy from coronavirusIn Bristol, one bar has decided to postpone opening for another, slightly different reason.Staff at the the Volunteer Tavern have discovered a bird nest in the garden with three blue speckled eggs just days from hatching.The manager, Pete Gibbs, said that the bird – nicknamed Mama Mint by employees – appears to have made her home there while the pub has been out of action.“Even when we were having our socially distanced meeting in the garden, we realised it was pretty much impossible to stand anywhere and not be too close to Mama Mint,” he told the BristolLive website. “We decided that if we’re so worried about disturbing her when there’s only 10 of us, how are we going to open the pub to the public and keep people away from her?”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Some children, notably those of designated key workers, are already in schools.Teachers warned that some of the plans would be “enormously challenging” to implement, with a headteachers’ union singling out provisions for “bubbles”.“The logistics of keeping apart many different ‘bubbles’ of children in a full school, including whole-year groups comprising hundreds of pupils, is mind-boggling,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Hong Kongers have said they feel torn between the life-changing decision to leave their homes and take up the UK’s citizenship offer - or staying to fight for their freedom. Boris Johnson\u0027s government has offered almost three million residents eligible for British National Overseas (BNO) passports the chance to settle in the UK and ultimately apply for citizenship after China imposed a new security law on the former UK colony. But leaving behind homes, jobs and loved ones to move almost 6,000 miles across the world is not an easy decision to make, said some of those considering the move.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther Hong Kongers currently abroad said they were fearful of returning home after the law - which makes it easier to punish protesters and reduces the territory\u0027s autonomy from Beijing - came into effect on Tuesday.Theodore*, who did not want to give his real name for security reasons, is currently studying in Europe. Live: China warns UK not to ‘interfere’ in Hong KongSenate sends China sanctions over Hong Kong crackdown to Trump\u0027s deskHong Kong’s protesters ‘prepare for long fight’ as China tightens gripThe spirit of protest in Hong Kong is still alive – but they need helpWho in Hong Kong is eligible for UK residency?His parents had already urged him not to return home after he became a vocal critic of the Beijing government last year, even appearing on local television. With the passing of the new security law, they are even more fearful for his safety. “It’s soul-crushing to think I can’t return to Hong Kong,” he told The Independent. “I can\u0027t imagine not speaking out for Hong Kong, or against the very obvious threat the Chinese government poses to the entire world,” he said. “Even if I settled in the UK and went back to Hong Kong occasionally, I could still be arrested. And the idea of not going back for years, if not decades, is soul-crushing.” The detail of the new law means that if he discussed the threat China poses to the UK while in Britain that would also be a crime in Hong Kong. Theodore says he has “complicated feelings” towards the British move to extend citizenship rights to Hong Kongers since the UK government “took away our rights to live in the UK back in the 1970s-80s with a string of nationality laws.

He said he would like to continue his studies in the UK – but he was born in 1997 and his parents aren’t from Hong Kong so he doesn’t qualify for a BNO passport.  His older sister, on the other hand, is eligible - but has a four-year-old child and doesn’t want to move across the world to an unfamiliar place. Ben said many Hong Kongers now fear China, or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), will “send them to concentration camps in the future”. “I’m afraid but I’m still fighting for the freedom to the last minute,” he said. “Most of the young people in Hong Kong believe we can win this war. I have friends who have BNOs but Hong Kong is our home.” For now, he said, they will stay and fight while preparing for the “worst-case scenario”. Sam* has campaigned for greater rights for BNO holders for years. While he welcomed the UK’s offer, he never envisioned making such a big move during retirement. He said he would like to rent - and maybe one day even own - a house in a big city like Liverpool or Birmingham once he and his family “learn the UK way of life”. “It’s very sad about the changes in Hong Kong,” he told The Independent. “I was born in Hong Kong, I live in Hong Kong, I married and have a child in Hong Kong and I’m feeling so sad that I have to make a decision during my retirement – it\u0027s a big move. “We really fear the CCP and we are very afraid that Hong Kong will be a second version of Xinjiang and will be made to be an open prison “We see the Hong Kong police will be turned into something like the police state. We are very fearful walking on the streets now because they can stop and search anyone.” Sam said if you ask people in Hong Kong for their “status” now “I think they will say they are Hong Kongers”. He added many will stay and fight to see “who will be stronger, who will die first – China or Hong Kong”, but if he moves to the UK he doesn’t plan on looking back. “Hong Kong is our roots,” said Eunice, who has just graduated from Imperial College London with a master\u0027s degree in science.  She moved to the UK for boarding school as a child but her once-frequent trips home to see her parents have become less and less as she is fearful of returning. “It’s very difficult to know that you are not able at the moment to go back to your home,” she said. “The younger generation do get targeted so maybe that is something I have to be very careful about.” Eunice, who hopes to stay in the UK and contribute back to society, said she noticed the changes in Hong Kong when she last visited more than a year ago. “Just, like, casually going out on a Sunday to do some shopping in the tube station you see armed police standing there – that\u0027s something shocking for me,” she said. She added her parents have BNO passports but they are waiting for further details to be released by the Home Office before making such a big decision. Johnny Patterson, director of the Hong Kong Watch campaign group, said the security law has “really terrified people”. “I had one message from a friend who works in a civil society group who said their daughter had been having nightmares about them getting arrested so she stepped back from working for the organisation,” he told The Independent.  “It’s a very sobering, serious change that we are seeing in Hong Kong.  “It’s not yet clear how many people will move to the UK – I think it will depend on what happens in terms of how China applies the law. There probably is no going back to the Hong Kong we knew before but what the new Hong Kong looks like is an unknown.” John Hu, founder of John Hu Migration Consulting, based in Hong Kong, said English-speaking countries are the top choices for Hong Kongers looking to move – and that he has received 10 calls today, some from existing clients, applying to move to the UK.“I think the Hong Kongers are more determined now,” he told The Independent. “They will see they will have less freedom of speech and democracy and values of Hong Kong people.”*Some names have been changed to protect identities.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

There is an issue of defining what is it that the British really want. Do the British actually want a no deal Brexit ”#There are some who would suggest they do. Though some people in the Conservative Party want to wreck the European Union.”#Ive seen certain Tory MPs saying we must get Brexit right because we want others to follow us # because we want to set an example in the way we deal with Brexit so that others will leave the European Union.##Well,thats the approach of the British Government then it would be better to have no deal.#Next week’s Brexit meeting will be the first time talks take place in London. It was previously planned to hold discussions in London near the start of negotiations, however this had to be abandoned due to the coronavirus pandemic.The meeting will come after Michel Barnier accused British trade negotiators of a lack of respect, with Brexit talks ending a day early today amid #serious ergences# between the UK and the EU.The big Brexit news today is, of course, that the UK and the EU has failed to make progress.UK chief negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier had intended to meet alone on Friday.But officials said that plan had been ditched.#The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful,# Frost said in a statement. #But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.#Barnier said the bloc continued to believe an agreement was possible and in everyones interest.Following on from that last blog post about immigration halving in Scotland post-Brexit, theres some reaction from the Scottish Governments independent expert advisory group on migration and population.The group has found that .% of roles in Scotland pay less than £,, including up to % of jobs in the care sector.Scotlands gender pay gap also means that .% of jobs currently employing females would not be available to migrants.Professor Christina Boswell of the University of Edinburgh, who chairs the group, said there may be a #moderate expansion of immigration# from outside the EU due to the reduced salary threshold but remote and rural areas of Scotland #will still be more adversely affected after Brexit, because of the lower number of jobs available meeting the threshold#.Immigration into Scotland could be halved by the proposed salary threshold and risks staff shortages in areas such as the care sector, a study has found.Home Office plans post-Brexit would require migrant workers to earn at least £, a year to be able to work in the UK.Currently, skilled workers from outside the European Union need to have a job offer with a minimum salary of £, to be eligible for employment, but after Brexit the £, threshold will apply to those both inside and outside the EU.Self-employed people would not be eligible to migrate to the UK to work under the UK Governments plans.Analysis by the Scottish Governments independent expert advisory group on migration and population estimates a reduction of net migration to Scotland of between % and %, based on forecasts of both EU and non-EU migrant labour.Michel Barnier is not holding his usual press conference today after a week of negotiations.He usually takes the opportunity to berate Britain.Both sides were optimistic that the first physical meeting since the start of the pandemic would help break the current deadlock.Negotiations will continue next week in London.The EU wants the final deal finalised by October so it can be ratied by the end of the year.Negotiations ended early after talks broke down over fisheries and the #level playing# that would give the UK access to the single market.Michel Barnier said the EU side had #listened carefully# to British concerns, but again made clear there could be no deal without agreements on fisheries and the so-called #level playing# requiring the UK to follow EU standards infor continued access to the single market.Negotiators on both sides disagree on regulations for businesses.In regards to the fishing industry, the UK is strongly against EU demands for long-term access to British waters.Mr Barnier did say some progress was made in areas including police cooperation or UK participation in EU programs Michel Barnier said that serious dferences remain after talked between the UK and the EU ended early.Barnier said that while Brussels had engaged #constructively#, officials needed to see an #equivalent engagement from the UK side#.He said: #Our goal was to get negotiations successfully and quickly on a trajectory to reach an agreement..#However, after four days of discussions, serious ergences remain.#The latest round of Brexit talks have ended early with #signicant dferences# still remaining on both sides.Boris Johnsons Europe adviser David Frost said: #We have completed our discussion of the full range of issues in the negotiation in just over three days. Our talks were face-to-face for the first time since March and this has given extra depth and flexibility to our discussions.#The negotiations have been comprehensive and useful. But they have also underlined the signicant dferences that still remain between us on a number of important issues.#Talks in Brussels between Mr Frosts team and the EU side led by Michel Barnier were due to continue into Friday.Mr Frost said talks will continue next week in London. British firms are worried the governments planned systems to check goods going to the EU wont be ready in time by the Brexit transition period ends in . Boris Johnsons government is planning to bring an entirely new IT system to help check goods heading to the EU from the start of January.Rod McKenzie, the Road Haulage Associations Rod McKenzie, said confusion over how the IT system would work andit would be ready on time was #a cocktail for potential disaster at the moment#.He told Business Insider: #The worry over this new IT system is massive. You wouldnt think youd choose to run an entirely new and complex system with a bit of IT kit that nobody quite knows will actually work.#The French might be helpful when it comes to UK imports staying in France — but what about those going further afield  Its so unclear and so frustrating.#Economics minister John Glen has told lords that #we have not had any signicant feedback from the EU# on the UKs position in regards to financial services. He added that he hopes there would be a similar approach and that there would #not be a bonfire of regulations#. Britain is set to reopen its temporary market access regime for EU financial companies in September.This is to help firms through the Brexit orce period, City A.M. reported.There is currently a “temporary permissions regime” in place for EU-based financial companies. Nausicaa Delfas, the Financial Conduct Authority’sexecutive director for international, said in an online event: #Over , firms and over  fund managers have already notied us, and we will reopen the notication window on  September.# Remainer Anna Soubry predicts the UK will beasking to rejoin the EU in  years.Speaking on LBC, the former Tory MP claimed history will record Brexit as a terrible mistake. The leader of Change UK said:#Im a realist and the reality is weve left the European Union.#I dont think theres an appetite at large for some movement that would win widespread support for us to rejoin because we havent even fully left yet.#I think it will be my childrens generation that will do it, I think well be back in the EU in ten years time.#Of course well never get the unique and very special and very good deal that we once had.#No doubt the EU will say wellyou want to rejoin you have to join the Euro, youve got to join Schengen. We were in a unique position but theres no point in looking backwards, weve got to look to the future.#The pound sterling has stayed neutral against the euro as investors are assessing the probability of the UK being able to sign a trade deal with the EU by the end of this year.July is a critical month for the pound as by the end, it should become clear with Britain will walk away with a deal or not.Stephen Gallo, European head of FX strategy at BMO, said: #The second to last week and the last week of July are going to be the extreme Brexit crunch point.#If theres not movement by the week of th or the week of th, that may be the second wave of selling in sterling.#Against the euro, sterling was steady at . pence.Trading between the EU and UK will still flourish in the short-term even WITHOUT a Brexit deal, a top WTO candidate has said.Hamid Mamdouh, who is seeking to run the World Trade Organization, said that the historic alliance between Britain and the EU should allow for goods and services to continue to flow across the borders. The former WTO director of trade and services in investment said while on the broadcaster Econ Films’ CoronaNomics programme: #The UK and the EU have been following the same regulatory framework across sectors of the economy and that provides an exceptionally strong basis for strong and close trade relations, eventhey fall on WTO rules.“There will still be the reality of business flourishing in a way that, of course, isn’t as strong as when the UK was a member state of the EU, but it’s the passage of time without a bilateral agreement that will have an effect.” Tory former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine criticised Boris Johnsons investment plan to boost the economy.Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio s Today programme: “What we have is a twin crisis, which is the crisis of the corona epidemic… and it is over with the crisis of Brexit.“It is a crisis of unprecedented scale and it is going to get worse.“So, the question really is how is the Government responding, how should it respond “And I have to say I was deeply disappointed in the speech the Prime Minister made in Dudley.“It was simply the sort of speech with a lot of proposals which were remarkably similar to what all governments have done faced with rising unemployment.“They announce packets of money in housing and transport and repairs for the health service… but they lack the one thing that is essential, and that is the local enthusiasm, energy and enterprise.” The UK Government has unveiled a new body called #Office for Talent# to attract scientists, researchers and innovators to come to the country.It will make immigration #simple, easy and quick# for those wanting to move to the UK.It comes as scientists have warned of uncertainty over Brexit could see top researchers and innovators leaving the UK.The roadmap for the new Research and Development will cut #unnecessary red tape# to encourage the brightest and the best to work and study in the UK.It includes a £m investment for upgrading scientic infrastructure.EU and UK Brexit negotiators are set to hold a fourth day of talks in Brussels.Boris Johnosn has refused to extend the current Brexit transition period which means both sides will have to find an agreement before the end of this year.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that the EU must prepare to not reach a deal.The Chairman of Germanys Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Norbert Roettgen has had some strong words to say about a no-deal Brexit. Speaking with Channel  News, he said #both sides are to blame#a no-deal Brexit went ahead.The prospect #would be disadvantageous to both sides# but it would #hit Britain much harder# the MP said.However, he added: #We still can do something # we are living in a threatening, chaotic world and we have to stay together because unity means strength.#Britain is alone # we are #.Angela Merkel says Britain will have to #live with the consequences# of Boris Johnsons decision to loosen economic ties with the EU in the event of a no-deal exit.The PM scrapped the idea of maintaining close economic ties with the EU after the Brexit transition period ends on December . The German chancellor said: #We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want. That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU, will respond appropriately.#With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves.#It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.#Lord Heseltine, the architect of government plans for urban renewal in the s, said he believed Brexit added uncertainty and unpredictability to the issues created by the coronavirus pandemic. “Brexit and COVID add-up to one great question mark,# he said. #Its no use just making speeches that just talk about bouncing this way or that. The people who are going to be making the decisions are hard-headed, responsible iniduals. #Theyre not going to listen to political speeches before they make political decisions. #They will look at the hard facts as they see them on the ground. What are our sales like  What order books are we facing  What markets do we think were going to penetrate  #What trade deals has anyone actually signed  When you start answering those questions you can begin to talk about bounce. But until you answer those questions you are spitting in the wind”.He said he believed that taxes would have to rise as a result of the pandemic, saying that “someones got to pay for the spending round that COVID has injected in to our economy”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Until his recent election the Tories had it easy, confronted by an opposition led by Marxist radical Jeremy Corbyn, whose incompetence was matched by his extremism. But Sir Keir is a far more formidable opponent. He is sharp where Corbyn was dim, pragmatic where Corbyn was dogmatic.Corbyn constantly pandered to the left-wing fringe because he was part of it. But Sir Keir has just proven his toughness by sacking leadership contender Rebecca Long Bailey from the shadow cabinet, after she expressed her support for actor Maxine Peake who used a newspaper interview to peddle conspiracy theories about the Israeli secret service. Corbynista zealots were appalled, moderates celebrated.Furthermore, the dismissal of Long Bailey was just part of a systematic removal of hard Left influence in the party.Much to the fury of left-wing agitators, Starmer yesterday dismissed calls for the police to be “defunded” in the wake of anti-racism protests. Emphasising his past work with the police as Director of Public Prosecutions, he labelled such demands as “nonsense”. Out are Corbyn allies like Jennie Formby, the former General Secretary. And in comes the new chief David Evans, described by admirers as “a stanch opponent” of the hardliners.According to the latest polls, the British public is warming to the new Labour leader. In one survey last week,  per cent expressed a preference for him as Prime Minister, two points ahead of Boris Johnson.Interviewed by the BBC on Sunday, former leader Ed Miliband joined in the cheer-leading, saying: “I never had his approval ratings. I think he has made a great start.”Yet it would be wrong for Labour supporters to be carried away. Sir Keir might be a better leader than Corbyn and Miliband, but those two set the bar very low. The truth is that Labour still has a mountain to climbStarmer is to become Prime Minister. His party is still a deluded rabble, dominated by the worst kind of toxic identity politics, contempt for Britain and student union dogma. Labour is ready for neither victory at the ballot box, nor for the governance of our country.Parallels are sometimes drawn with the situation now and that of , when John Major’s Government was engulfed by the financial crisis of Black Wednesday five months after winning the General Election against Neil Kinnock’s Labour. But the huge dference is that Labour was on the advance, having won a further  seats at the election. Power was almost within the party’s grasp, given that Major only had a tiny majority. But today, Labour is still reeling from the humiliation it suffered last December, when it lost  seats, the biggest loss for any opposition in a century. Moreover, the party is in the wilderness in Scotland. Once Labour’s Caledonian fortress, the party has just one MP there.In total, the Conservatives have no fewer than  more MPs than Labour.That means the job that now faces Starmer is daunting. To be the biggest party, Labour would have to make  net gains from the Tories on a swing of  per cent. Even in the phenomenal landslide of , the swing to Tony Blair was only . per cent.And there is not the slightest sign of that happening at the moment, in spite of all the Government’s recent problems. It is a remarkable fact that the latest two opinion polls both show that the Conservatives, after ten years in office with a very mixed record, are still seven points ahead of Labour.Indeed, there is even a danger that Labour could slip back further. A recent internal review by the party into the disastrous  defeat warned that a further  seats in Labour’s heartlands could be vulnerable on a very small swing to the Tories.The central problem for Starmer is that his party, fixated by fashionable theories of social justice, has alienated its traditional voters. It will take more than the sacking of Rebecca Long Bailey or reassuring words about the police to bring them back. As the sensible former MP Natascha Engel wrote this month, Labour must recognise how far it “has shted from it core. If it wants to sht back again, the party will have to find the right road and prepare itself for a very long walk.” But the journey has barely begun. A party that is willing twice to elect Jeremy Corbyn as its leader is not going to change overnight.In reality, Labour remains gripped by far Left ideology, as shown by its eager embrace of the cultural revolution. Decent, patriotic working-class voters, once the bedrock of the Labour movement, are bound to be repelled by the endless posturing against Britain or the police or family le or even common sense. Despite the change of leadership, the insanity remains. At the weekend, Labour front-bencher Lloyd Russell-Moyle was forced to apologise after disgracefully attacking JK Rowling for using her own experience of domestic sexual assault as “a justication for discriminating” against transgender campaigners.In the same vein, senior Labour MP Dawn Butler recently declared on Good Morning Britain that “a child is born without sex”, a piece of biological nonsense that is about as sane as saying the Earth is flat. The atmosphere of a cult still hangs over the party. The lunatic Left has certainly not gone away, as reflected in MP Richard Burgon’s celebration that teaching unions thwarted “Tory attempts to force schools to re-open. When the row about statues was at its most hysterical, Lisa Nandycalled for imperialist murals to be removed from the magnicent interior of the Foreign Office. Similarly, the Nottingham MP Nadia Whitthome, sounding asshe lived in an occupied country, expressed her thrill at the movement to topple monuments of the past: “I celebrate these acts of resistance.”Sir Keir is not the figure likely to win back the traditional working-class, particularly not in the Red Wall seats of the Midlands and the North. This is, after all, a figure who used to edit a radical magazine called Socialist Futures, who built his reputation as a metropolitan-based human rights lawyer, who presided over the Crown Prosecution Service when it gained notoriety for its failure to take a tough stance on crime, and who battled ferociously for a second referendum on Brexit. For all the ordinariness of his upbringing as the son of a toolmaker and a nurse, he is now the personication of the North London liberal elite. Moreover, he lacks both authority and charisma. With his strangulated vowels and permanently anxious expression, he frequently sounds like a teacher who is surprised at this promotion to be head of department.The political landscape could have changed dramatically by , when the next election is due. Britain may have enjoyed a strong economic recovery. The culture war may have petered out. Public services may have been reformed. Mrs Thatcher was in desperate trouble in , battered by riots and rising unemployment. Two years later she won a landslide. It is perfectly possible that Boris Johnson could enjoy the same fate – especiallyLabour fails to change.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody is so reliant on somebody  providing everything for them that when things did get a little bit tense the results were scary.“And when we saw that, we were extremely glad we’d come here.”Matthew and Charis’ way of le has become the new frontier for many as the coronavirus pandemic has sparked a huge rise in people seeking advice on how to prepare for the possibility that civilisation could collapse.While the idea is far from a new one - just ask the Mayans or the Romans - France has witnessed an explosion in students of la collapsologie, or collapsology, in the wake of the virus.In the UK, retailers selling basic survival goods have seen sales rocket up to , per cent, while others want those who live self-sufficiently like Matthew and Charis to teach them how to not depend on others to survive.Here, Sun Online explores the collapsology movement, askingcivilisation is truly crumbling and,so, is coronavirus the beginning of the end Doomsdayers. Survivalists. Preppers. There are countless names and iations for those who believe the end is nigh.Many are dismissed as conspiracy theorists. But while collapsology has its roots in the same idea, the reaction on how to cope is dferent.Rather than bunkering down alone in an abandoned nuclear facility and preparing to weather the storm alone, the movement aims to save society as a society - starting rural, communal lestyles while welcoming communication with the wider world.One collapsology Facebook group in France has seen its numbers reach , members during lockdown and the idea is turning mainstream thanks to support from senior politicians, respected authors and a popular Black Mirror-style drama series.The movement was born on the back of Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jared Diamond’s celebrated book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed in .The work focuses on the effect environmental impacts - such as droughts, dwindling crop yields and swings in temperature - had on ancient civilisations. However, Diamond also looks at the similarities those societies faced with today’s world - including environmental changes, the impact of climate change, hostile neighbours and trade partners.The theory was further popularised by a  book, How Everything Can Collapse, by Pablo Servigne and Raphaël Stevens.Some of its supporters, like former French environment minister Yves Cochet, believe the coronavirus crisis is just a further sign of impending catastrophe.People who follow the collapsology movement aren’t waiting for the apocalypse, nor believe the end of the world is fast-approaching.More, they are expecting and preparing for the fall of our current civilised society.Unlike doomsday preppers and other survivalist movements, collapsologists live among us in mainstream society and don’t intend to frighten people.Rather, they work to prove the number of potential crises that could burst one day and explore what we can do to ease this.People in the collapsology movement think about how we can prepare the new world to be built quickly and in the best way.While the term is yet to truly take hold in the UK, thousands have been looking at becoming more independent since coronavirus hit.“Our sales have gone through the roof, as high as a , per cent increase since January, says Lincoln Miles, , owner of Preppers Shop UK in Newquay, Cornwall.“The supermarket panic buying in March definitely showed us how fragile it all is and how quickly everything can change. “I think we only just avoided what could have been a real crisis, but the fact that it got so close to it made people wake up and realise we can’t rely on this because this could happen again.The fragility of the whole system was exposed.”Many followers of collapsology are keen to stress it isn’t just another Facebook conspiracy video, nor is it the prediction of the sudden and apocalyptic end of the world.It’s about uniting to act upon scientists’ warnings on the effects of climate change, as well as archaeologists study of how whole empires can fail.Loïc Steffan, a French economist and author of Don’t Be Scared of Collapse, says Covid- “was a stress-test that has allowed us to see what works and what doesn’t”.The self-declared optimist, who is a prominent figure in the French movement, adds: “The collapsologist wants to save society. The survivalist is an inidualist.”For others, it’s a commitment to sustainability, while helping others to do the same.The movement, which sprung from Jared Diamonds  book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, struck a chord with many, including Essex vets Matthew and Charis.“I had read a few collapsology books, including Jared Diamond’s, and found that I myself had had a collapse in faith in the stories of our culture and societies,” reveals Matthew.“The scientists’ warnings are pretty stark, and often not stark enough.“I just started to think: ‘You know, I’d be more comfortable with a little patch of land where I could learn to provide our needs for ourselves rather than relying on mortgages from banks and food from supermarkets,’ so that’s what we did.” Matthew and Charis, , bought three acres of land in Pembrokeshire for £, and spent a further £, on building a house, chicken coops, greenhouses, a horse poo-powered gas cooker and even a hot tub.They are entirely self-sufficient, installing solar , growing their own fruit and veg, building beehives, rearing up to  chickens and converting lorries and flatbed hay trailers into zero-carbon living quarters.“We haven’t gone full hippy though,” adds Matthew. “We still have Netflix and Disney+. We aren’t cut off from le entirely - but we are entirely dependent on ourselves now.Since buying the land in  and making the full-time move a year later, Matthew and Charis have had daughter Elsa and son Billy.As their lives on Beeview Farm have grown, so has the buzz about it from others.After years of mistakes and learning on the job, Matthew and Charis are now running farm tours and even classes so others can follow.“We’ve only been running the tours and courses for about a year and the interest has been growing, Matthew adds.“People are desperate to come but we’ve had to postpone visits because of the virus.“There are people who want to do it and our message is: ‘Go. Just do it, do it.’“If you trust what the scientists are saying in any way then you don’t have time to waste waiting for it to be proved.”Is it the beginning of the end  It all depends on who you ask.In France, Yves Cochet, a former environment minister for the government, predicted the start of the end by  as a result of a petrol crisis or environmental change.However, after coronavirus, he now says: “It’s happening even faster than we thought.”In the UK, one of the country’s few academic “collapsologists” Dr Guy Middleton remains wary of making total apocalyptic predictions.The Newcastle University lecturer, whose published books include Understanding Collapse: Ancient History and Modern Myths, says: “Putting it in terms of Extinction Rebellion or Greta Thunberg, the idea that action is necessary now, is really important - but without the survivalist mentality.“Our society now sits on a scale that is absolutely unprecedented including the rate of extinction of marine and land species, pollution of oceans, plastic pollution and so on. “But I tend to think that humanity will stagger on until it absolutely can’t. It might lose a lot of people but it’s probably not going to be in the next  years.“We are a resilient and adaptable species.”Words like “scary”, “collapse” and “catastrophe” are often used when describing the reasons people decide to quit “normal le”.However, Matthew insists the two biggest factors others should follow suit are entirely positive.He says: “One, it is terric fun. And two, it just makes complete financial sense.“The dficulty of doing it sometimes stems from the ‘prepper movement’, I would never describe us as preppers. But it is often seen as revolving around conspiracy theories.“We’re going with the scientists - it’s a good idea to prep, but we’re not prepping for the Millennium Bug or anything like that.“We’ve built a farm for a lot less than £, and it’s all ours. “We don’t owe anybody any money and we don’t have any bills - why aren’t more people doing this ”Lincoln, who has run the UK’s biggest prepper shop, for almost seven years, believes people are keen to strike a balance between convenience and independence.He adds: “I’m not sure whether people are necessarily moving off grid due to it but there’s definitely a huge resurgence in people going back to the old ways of doing it themselves, like making their own bread or learning actual skills rather than relying on products from a shop. To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.“There’s a lot of going back to basics and learning to do it from scratch.“People are thinking how they can filter water rather than buy water or provide their homes with energythere was no electricity, changing their houses to be a bit more off-grid without living in the wild.“It’s worth being ready.

A-level pupils will get their results on August  and GCSE students will be given grades on August .All pupils are set toto school from September.Under the new plans published today, schools in England are set to use “year bubbles” to get every child back learning this September.They have been urged to separate entire year groups with staggered start and finish times to keep them apart during breaks and lunch.The move would see bigger schools enact bubbles of , with entire classes kept together to keep them safe.The advice also demands the bubbles stay together on public transport when coming into school.It says the approach to travel should align as far as possible with the principles underpinning the system of controls followed by the schools.Secondary school pupils could be isolated in their year groups - limiting their interactions with students of dferent ages.Despite the new measures, the Government has told schools to focus on core subjects, with a full curriculum possibly not back til .Previously the Government had said they wanted all primary kids to be back in the classrooms for a month before the summer, but this plan was dropped after an outcry from schools and unions. Schools in Wales went back yesterday, but only a third are allowed in at once.

Using your skill and ingenuity, you have to predict which town or city will be the next to be put on special measures .⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesTowns and cities where people haven’t been behaving themselves.Right now, it’s Leicester in the sin bin. They are a very community-minded bunch and couldn’t resist going out to meet each other. So there’s a Covid spike.Experts reckon the next place to cop it will be Doncaster. They’re a friendly bunch there, too. But I reckon there’s a decent outside chance it will be Bournemouth or Brighton. Or maybe Cardf is worth a flutter.The people of Leicester are confused, as well they might be. They don’t know what they’re allowed to do any more. I don’t blame them.But it will be as nothing to the confusion across the country which comes as a result of Super Saturday.July  is the day the Government has said we can shake off our chains and go out and get wrecked. Or something.Have you got any plans for the weekend  Going to a rave  Or just down the pub to breathe over as many people as you possibly can. Here’s my big worry. That Super Saturday will be followed, five days later, by Terrible Thursday.Five days is the average time it takes for the Covid virus to make itself known to the person it has taken up home in. That slightly ticklish cough. Bit of a temperature. Uh-oh.Restaurants, pubs, campsites and children’s playgrounds will all be open for business from Saturday. Oh, and hairdressers. Remember them Obviously, it is right that the UK must emerge from what the Prime Minister called its long hibernation. But I think these things need to be done gradually, rather than all at once.Frankly, I would have started with our schools. Teachers have proved themselves to be just about the only people in the country who can’t work from home. Most kids have enjoyed painfully few virtual lessons, and reopening schools first would have shown where our priorities lie.But it’s not a good idea, in my book, to release the bats all in one go. Many people will have taken from Boris’s announcement last week that, after July , lockdown is effectively over.And some of the Government’s guidelines make it easy to be confused.  The two-metre social-distancing rule has been relaxed to something called “one metre-plus”. I haven’t a clue what dference that makes.And the whole thing is very dficult to monitor. The police say they don’t know how they will deal with it.The virus has been dying out because, by and large, we have been abiding by lockdown. The summer sun has helped, too. The best thing we can do to keep that curve plummeting is to do much as we have been doing so far.The last thing we need this summer is a sudden second spike.If you use that phrase you’re supposedly signalling you’re vulnerable. And need attention. But what about the ones who really did have pasta and liked it  And aren’t at all messed up but just want to share their evening meal experiences in a very real sense  They are strange creatures, the young.THE country is on course for a wonderful, “V-shaped economic recovery”, according to a bloke at the Bank of England.I don’t know what that means. A month or so back, the Bank of England was saying the economy was in ruins for ever, mass unemployment, bankruptcies – giant mutant crabs marching across the country eating our children. Or something.Never believe an economist. You’d be better off talking to Mystic Meg.THE latest historical figure to be attacked by people with no sense of history is Charles Dickens.A former Green Party councillor, Ian Driver, sprayed graffiti on a museum to the author, with the inevitable word “racist”.I supposewe were to ban Dickens, it would bring cheer to millions of schoolkids.Great Expectations can be a bit of a grind to get through when you are young.But this tearing down of history has to stop.Was Dickens racist  Yup. He lived in Victorian Britain. Almost everybody had views which wouldn’t go down very well today.But he was also a brilliant writer and a philanthropist.We are all better than our worst acts.The Chinese authorities are reportedly sterilising these people now – taking a leaf out of Hitler’s book. Yet this outrage raises barely a flicker of publicity. Even other Muslim countries don’t complain too much. That’s because they don’t want to upset the third worst country in the world . And what does the United Nations say  Nothing. Just like it says nothing about China’s occupation of Tibet, or its bullying of democracy campaigners in Hong Kong.A GOOD plan from the Prime Minister. Boris wants to turn the deserted shops in our high streets into homes for people.If he did that, he’d cure half of our housing problem very quickly. Without paving over the entire country for new estates.Many of our high streets are decaying. People now go to out-of-town shopping centres for an afternoon of misery with the missus.But here’s another idea for BoJo. Offices.Lockdown proved we don’t need offices like we used to. They were invented because we needed places to shuffle paper around. But we don’t use paper any more.

I think thats a very reasonable position and a very consistent position for the government.We are considering very actively and there are proposals that I asked to be brought forward several weeks ago.One policeman was allegedly stabbed by a protester as the sweeping and repressive new Chinese security laws came into place yesterday.Protesters have been out on the streets in defiance of China, which just passed a law banning protests and demonstrations in the semi-autonomous city.Hundreds of people - including a -year-old girl who was waving a flag calling for independence - were arrested as cops used water cannons and tear gas to try and drive protesters back.One police officer was pictured with a blood soaked shirt after someone put an approximately one inch gash in his left shoulder.HK Police posted pictures on Twitter of the officer being given stitches, saying he was stabbed by “rioters holding sharp objects.”Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas on Wednesday to break up the first protest since China introduced sweeping security legislation.Hundreds of arrests have been made, their first under the new legislation while warning of punishment for calling for secession or subversion.The new law makes secessionist, subversive, or terrorist activities illegal.Anyone taking part in pro-independence activities, such as shouting slogans or holding up banners and flags, is in violation of the law.A man was detained for carrying a flag that called for independence, while a woman was also held for carrying a sign bearing the same message with a British flag.Beijing only unveiled the details of the much-anticipated law late on Tuesday after weeks of uncertainty and years of public protest and international condemnation.The former British territory is China’s freest city and one of the world’s most glittering financial hubs.However, the new law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to le in prison.It will also see mainland security agencies in Hong Kong for the first time and allow for extradition to the mainland for trial.Wednesday saw thousands of protesters gathering downtown for an annual rally marking the anniversary of the handover to China in .“You are displaying flags or banners chanting slogans or conducting yourselves with an intent such as secession or subversion, which may constitute offenses under the national security law,” police said in a message displayed on a purple banner.Riot police used pepper spray and fired pellets as they made arrests after crowds spilled out into the streets chanting “resist till the end” and “Hong Kong independence”.Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, said the law was the most important development since the city’sto Chinese rule.“It is also an inevitable and prompt decision to restore stability,” Lam said at the harbour-front venue where  years ago the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, a staunch critic of the security law, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to Chinese rule.Some pro-Beijing officials and political commentators say the law is aimed at sealing Hong Kong’s “second ” to the motherland after the first failed to bring residents to heel.The move is a massive spit in the face of the British, who have promised refuge and citizenship to three million Hong Kong citizensChina strips them of their autonomy.Beijing has previously blasted the British offer as Cold War mentality.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Anyone who falls within the lockdown boundary has been urged to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel to and from the area.Yaz, who lives within the lockdown border with her hubby and three-year-old son Hazia in Barkby Thorpe, told the Sun Online: It’s so disappointing. Just when we thought we were back to some normality and making plans to see family, friends and our new neighbours this happens. The crazy thing is me and my immediate neighbour are now stuck in a zone with restrictions imposed but one neighbour and other householders down the road are out of it and free to enjoy the easing of rules from Saturday.The -year-old customer service adviser moved into her three-bed mews house shortly before the nation-wide lockdown began.She had been hoping to make friends with support worker Siri, , who has a five-year-old daughter Chanelle, but the new rules mean they will have to wait.Siri said: We havent had a chance to get to know each other and just have snatched conversations at a distance on the doorstep or on the drive. We wanted to get together properly and introduce the kids as soon as possible.It’s ridiculous that I could soon go to the pub or a hair salon allowed to open but I cant go into my neighbour’s home two doors away or she visit mine. I’m happy to be out of the zone but I have no idea why they’ve split out little street in two. It’s quite ridiculous that some of can have freedoms that other’s cant enjoy.The new rules do not state children from dferent zones cannot play together, but people are urged not to travel between them.Yaz, who has been self-isolating with her family, said: Everyone’s getting sick of it now, its been going on too long.She blames the local lockdown on lots of people with no interest in playing their part, adding: We’d rather be safe than sorry and we have to be careful because my husband suffers from an illness. Hopefully it will only be another fortnight before we can enjoy relaxed measures like the rest of my street.Siri cant wait to get back to her new-normality but agrees with her neighbour that a second lockdown was the right thing to do to stop the virus spreading.Leicestershire police Chief Constable Simon Cole said yesterday that he had “huge sympathy” with people living on streets that had been cut down the middle on the lockdown map. But he added: “You’ve got to draw the line somewhere.” Mr Cole said the force hopes “common sense will prevail” and will only enforce restrictions such as road blocks as a last resort.He added that all locked down locals need to do is stay at home: “It’s a pretty simple equation really - we live in an area where there’s a very, very dangerous disease that makes people really ill, and we currently, sadly, lead the nation in that illness.“What people are being asked to do is stay at home, what people are being asked to do is only travelit’s absolutely essential.A postcode checker has now been produced to try to end the confusion over which parts of Leicestershire are in the local lockdown area and which are not.It comes as neighbouring areas have raised concerns that people from Leicester will travel outside of the lockdown this weekend. Nottinghamshire Police said it is working with British Transport Police to clamp down on unnecessary travel from Leicester, while pubs in Nottingham have vowed to turn away Leicester residents who try to chance a pint this weekend.

the national standard for identying new coronavirus cases - is rising.This is suggestive of a genuine increase in numbers of new infections, not simply an artefact of increasing test rates, it said.The preliminary investigation report - released on Wednesday evening - suggested the infection rate in the city had fallen from . to . per , people in the from the week to June  to the seven days prior to June .This is still signicantly higher than the overall infection rate in England which fell over the same period from . to . per , - despite the easing of some lockdown restrictions.Number  played down a decrease in the coronavirus infection rate in Leicester contained in a PHE investigation into the outbreak.The PMs spokesman said: The report itself shows a slight decrease but that is not considered statistically signicant.And the seven-day infection rate in Leicester is  cases per , people which is three times higher than the rate for the next highest city, which is Bradford.Downing Street said that non-essential shops were closed in Leicester before regulations needed to enforce the lockdown extension had come into force.The PMs spokesman said he believed the regulations were signed on Wednesday, but said:were closed initially on the very firm advice of the Health Secretary who obviously set out the health reasons for why we were asking non-essential retail to close.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.And then as soon as the regulations come into place they are prevented by law from opening.But I think businesses did the right thing and they followed the guidance and request of the Health Secretary to close straight away.The spokesman said Public Health England and others were constantly monitoring levels of infection across the country and working with local authorities to implement additional measuresthey are needed.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The First Minister went a step further than England and unveiled a ban on entering retail outlets without a covering. She later said police would be able to enforce the ban with fixed penalty notices, according to the BBC. It goes a step further than the UK government, which has repeatedly stopped short of making face coverings in shops compulsory for England. On May  the government announced guidance saying face coverings may be beneficial in places where it is hard to follow maintain social distancing, such as some shops. But since then England has stopped short of making them mandatory despite them becoming so on public transport and for visitors in hospital.  Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government has been considering the issue of face coverings for some time now. She said: I can confirm today that from the expected start of phase three, which is July  next week, wearing face coverings will also be mandatory in shops. Children under five will be exempt from this rule, she added, along with those with certain medical conditions. But she said: For everyone , face coverings will be mandatory. This is not a decision we have taken lightly, it has taken us some time to reach this decision. But as we all start to interact more, it is vital we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors. During the Scottish Governmentaposs daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre social distancing rule can be reduced in the hospitality and retail sectors and on public transport from July .Pubs, restaurants and shops will be allowed to adhere to a one-metre rule instead, with mitigation measures in place. But the general rule in law will be that businesses must take reasonable measures to ensure two-metre distancing is maintained, she said. The First Minister also said , patients have now died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by one from , on Wednesday.  A total of , people have tested positive for the virus, up by five from , the previous day. Announcing the new measures, Ms Sturgeon said the science on physical distancing has not changed and there is an increased risk of somewhere between two and -fold in reducing the measure to one metre. But she said that as the number of infected iniduals falls, there is less chance of coming into contact with someone who has the virus so absolute risk is lower. She added the Government recognises the two-metre rule has benefits, but it also has serious economic implications which can impact on peopleaposs health. For those reasons when we enter stage three of the route map, which I hope will be the end of next week, we will allow exemptions for specic sectors where agreed mitigations must be put in place, she said. These mitigations could include improved ventilation, perspex screens and a requirement for businesses to collect the names and addresses of customers to help with contact tracing when that is necessary. Ms Sturgeon also said that where a business operates at less than two metres, there must be clear signs informing customers that they are entering a one-metre zone. Masks became mandatory north of the border on all public transport on June .

In addition, the arrival and departure time of each customer should also be recorded and the date on which they arrived. Andyou are going in a group - the aposlead memberapos should give the names and mobile numbers of those in the group. However, health authorities have admitted that the rules are not aposmandatoryapos and patrons can simply refuse to hand out that information.  Thousands of pubs across the country are planning to open their doors on Saturday as the coronavirus lowdown is eased.The guidance, released on Thursday by the Department of Health and Social Care, applies to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and similar venues. It is up to the discretion of management on how they want to collect to the information which must be deleted after three weeks. The guidance states: It is up to each business to determine how to collect this information.  The guidance encourages the use of digital systems for ease where possible, however organisations are free to use any logging system that works best for them. This information will only be used where necessary to help stop the spread of Covid-. It is hoped the rules will help authorities track down people who may have come into contact with the virus during a night out.  It adds: The records will help NHS Test and Trace to reach anyone who may at a later date be found to have potentially been in contact with a positive coronavirus case whilst at a particular venue, helping to quickly contact people at risk of the virus and prevent localised outbreaks before they occur. However, the guidance concedes the rules are legally unenforcable. While the government continues to encourage everyone to play their part to curb the virus,a member of the public does not wish to share their contact details, it is not mandatory. For instance,someone provides information when contacting the business, for example when booking a haircut, they can inform the organisation they do not what their details shared with NHS Test and Trace.

Housing minister Lord Greenhalgh said ending the ban on evictions was was an important step towards ending lockdown. It comes amid warnings homelessness could treble this year unless the government acts. And there are calls for the government to reverse the heartless decision.Landlords were banned from evicting tenants during the coronavirus crisis - and still arenapost allowed to start the process until August .But in response to a parliamentary question, Housing minister Lord Greenhalgh said this would soon come to an end. He said: From  August , the courts will begin to process possession cases again. This is an important step towards ending the lockdown and will protect landlords’ important right to regain their property. Work is underway with the judiciary, legal representatives and the advice sector on arrangements, including new rules, to ensure that judges have all the information necessary to make just decisions and that the most vulnerable tenants can get the help they need when possession cases resume. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran commented: “The idea that the government want to re-start evictions in the midst of a pandemic is unthinkable. This threatens a wave of homelessness in towns up and down the country, which added to that the threat of local lockdowns could create a toxic cocktail for the disease to thrive. Generation Rent this week warned homelessness could treble this year unless the government acts to help private renters. According to the group, rates of rent arrears have risen from % before the pandemic to %, which could make , households homeless.

The plan - which excludes English, maths and sciences - would allow for students who donapost have time to learn the entire syllabus in time. As previously announced, exam boards are also looking at pushing back the entire GCSE season next year so that exams only begin from June . If that happened, the overall number of exams might have to be reduced to allow more time for teaching. Theof each exam would likely have to rise in . While it makes no decisions, the consultation document raised the option of reducing the overall number of GCSEs. It said: If the exams were longer and public health safeguards remain in place next year, schools and colleges might find the exam series more dficult to manage. They might be required to clean exam desks and chairs between morning and afternoon exam sessions, for which there would be less timethe exams were longer. However,there were fewer exams overall the exam timetable could be more manageable, shorter and, therefore, more easily delayed. This would free up more time for teaching.  Ofqual has launched a two-week consultation on its plans for the GCSE and A-level exam series in . It comes after students have faced months of school and college closures due to the Covid- pandemic. The watchdog is considering how next yearaposs exam timetable could be changed to allow more time for teaching. The regulator has asked exam boards to considerGCSE results could come back in time for August . But Ofqual admitted: We recognise that to allow time for marking, GCSE results might also have to be delayed. The watchdog is also proposing removing the need for GCSE students to undertake science practicals.

A string of measures that were designed to stop the spread of the virus have been axed after they made it impossible to have everyone in at once. Unions had pleaded for extra money to open up classrooms in public buildings and have blended learning from home. But instead the government is telling schools to use exactly the same space they had before the pandemic. No money will be given for extra classrooms and schools are banned from running rotas. Pupils are expected in five days a week and there will be fines for absence. To squeeze everyone in, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will scrap the -pupil size limit on class bubbles - who stay together to stop the virus spreading further. Bubbles will now be an entire -pupil class or even an entire year group. Despite the massive increase, the rule that children must automatically isolateone member of their bubble tests positive has been scrapped. Instead, a whole class or year group may have to stay homean aposoutbreakapos is detected in a school - but this will be decided on a case-by-case basis. While staff are told to keep two metres apart from pupils where possible, the guidance accepts that in many cases that wonapost be possible between the pupils themselves. Instead, teachers will be told to keep the windows open, quarantine footballs for  hours between use, ban big school wind bands and choirs, and send any sick pupils home quickly. Despite this, shielding children are being advised to come back in - as are pregnant or vulnerable staff where there isnapost another option. The guidance accepts opening schools is a balance of risk - but says for the vast majority of children, the benefits of being back in school far outweigh the very low risk from coronavirus. Exams in  will go ahead but schools wonapost have toto the full curriculum until summer  as they focus on the areas where pupils most need to catch up. Year  pupils will consider dropping some of their GCSE subjectsit means they can preserve their grades in core subjects like English and maths. Hereaposs a round up of some of the key changes to advice to schools announced today. Children wonapost automatically have to isolatesomeone  in their class tests positive  The -pupil aposbubbleapos limit will be scrapped - allowing schools to create aposbubblesapos of a whole class or a whole year. aposBubblesapos were introduced as an anti-infection measure. They meant groups within the school were kept separate from each other - andone member of a bubble tested positive, the whole bubble had to go into isolation for two weeks. Bubbles will now be allowed to be much larger - and wonapost have to go into isolationone member tests positive. Instead a aposrapid risk assessmentapos will be carried out to determine who has been in aposclose contactapos with a child who tests positive - and tell them to self-isolate for two weeks.  Schools may have an outbreakthey have two or more confirmed cases of  coronavirus  within a fortnight. Government guidance says the whole site or year group may have to self-isolate at home. But it adds whole-school closures will not generally be necessaryschools implement the recommended controls. If there is an outbreak in a school, a mobile unit can be dispatched to test others who have been in contact with the person who has tested positive. Testing will focus on the personaposs class, followed by their year group, then the whole schoolnecessary, the guidance says. Schools are having to keep aposrecordsapos of close contact - yes, really Because isolation is no longer automatic, schools are being told to note down close contacts to trace infection. The guidance says: We recommend schools keep a record of pupils and staff in each group, and any close contact that takes places between children and staff in dferent groups. It adds: This should be a proportionate recording process. Schools do not need to ask pupils to record everyone they have spent time with each day or ask staff to keep definitive records in a way that is overly burdensome. Children will be expected to attend in person, full time - without rotas  Some hoped the government would re-open schools on a aposrotaapos basis, to cut the number of children in school at a given time and make social distancing easier. But from September, thataposs all out of the window. Children will be expected to attend, in person, five days a week. They say schools will be made aposCovid secureapos by:grouping children together avoiding contact between groups arranging classrooms with forward facing desks staff maintaining distance from pupils and other staff as much as possibleSchools will be sent home testing kits to give to parents  By September, all schools will be provided with a small number of home testing kits directly. They can then give these to parents or carers collecting a child who has developed symptoms at school. Or to staff who have developed symptoms at school, where they think providing one will signicantly increase the likelihood of them getting tested. Advice will be provided alongside these kits. Shielding children will be told to come back to school  As shielding advice changes for adults on August , it will also change for children. As such, any pupils who remain on the shielded patient list can alsoto school, as can those who have family members who are shielding. Butthereaposs a local outbreak, and the government reintroduces some level of shielding - theyaposll be allowed to stay home temporarily. There wonapost be any special rules for children from BAME backgrounds. Despite evidence that coronavirus poses a greater risk to people from BAME backgrounds, there will be no relaxation of rules for children based on ethnicity. Or children with other known aggravating factors, for that matter - including obesity and diabetes. Instead, when it comes to at-risk kids, the guidance simply says schools should tell parents to stop worrying and send their kids in. We recommend schools discuss their concerns and provide reassurance of the measures they are putting in place to reduce the risk in school. All children have to go to school - or face fines  The advice is very clear in this respect, stating simply that all pupils must attend school. It adds: If parents of pupils with signicant risk factors are concerned, we recommend schools discuss their concerns and provide reassurance of the measures they are putting in place to reduce the risk in school. Schools should be clear with parents that pupils of compulsory school age must be in school unless a statutory reason applies . Schools and councils will bring back the availability to issue sanctions, including fixed penalty notices. The government doesnapost think schools need to make adaptations or open new buildings. Just open a window  Picking a fight with teachers, unions and many parents - the government says it doesnapost think schools will need to make any signicant adaptations to reopen to all students. Nor does the government think taking over additional buildings - like church halls and community centres, as has been suggested - will be necessary. Guidance says bluntly: Schools should use their existing resources to make arrangements to welcome all children back. There are no plans at present to reimburse additional costs incurred as part of that process. Instead, the advice suggests improving ventilation in classrooms - including by opening windows. And it says while schools should avoid clogging up in corridors, passing briefly in the corridor or playground is low risk. It adds: Dferent groups don’t need to be allocated their own toilet blocks, but toilets will need to be cleaned regularly and pupils must be encouraged to clean their hands thoroughly after using the toilet. The full curriculum may notuntil next summer  Schools are asked to teach an ambitious and broad curriculum in all subjects but will have to focus on covering the most important gaps. The guidance admits: Substantial modication to the curriculum may be needed at the start of the year. Teaching time should be prioritised to address signicant gaps in pupils’ knowledge with the aim of ing to the school’s normal curriculum content by no later than summer term . Year  pupils may drop some GCSE subjects  The guidance says: In exceptional circumstances, it may be in the best interests of a year  pupil to discontinue an examined subject. This may bethe school decides they would achieve signicantly better in their remaining subjects as a result - especially in English or maths.School trips will be back on While overnight visits will be discouraged, day trips will be allowed. The guidance also suggests schools should make use of outdoor spaces in the local area to support delivery of the curriculum. School choirs, hymns in assembly and brass bands are out Thereaposs an increased risk of infection from singing, chanting and playing blown instruments. While the advice doesnapost ban singing and wind instrument lessons, it does say they should happen outsidepossible. And it says: Singing, wind and brass playing should not take place in larger groups such as school choirs and ensembles, or school assemblies. Footballs will go into  hoursapos quarantine Resources that are shared between classes or bubbles, such as sports, art and science equipment, should be cleaned frequently and meticulously between use. Thereaposs an alternativethis isnapost possible - they can berotated to allow them to be left unused and out of reach for a period of  hours. That increases to  hours when the material is plastic. Assemblies remain banned - and break and start times are to be staggered  Groups should be kept apart, meaning that schools should avoid large gatherings such as assemblies or collective worship, the guidance says. Schools should also consider staggered break times and lunch times . Schools should work with partners to consider staggered start times to enable more journeys to take place outside of peak hours. Pupils are being told to walk or cycle Schools should encourage parents, staff and pupils to walk or cycle to schoolat all possible. Driving may be an option for some. For those who have to take dedicated school buses, they will follow the same social distancing rules and mask-wearing as public transport.

A study of , adults found three quarters have a new aposquar-routineapos following lockdown which sees them leaving food shopping in bags for an average of  minutes before unpacking it. And post and deliveries are left for  minutes before touching them. Almost four in  have added cleaning door handles to their usual cleaning routine, % wear a face mask to the supermarket and % no longer pet dogs when out on a walk. The research, which was commissioned by Fulvisafe, a new non-alcohol, antiviral and anti-bacterial sanitizer brand, also found % are more aware of their hygiene habits now.  This has seen the average adult wash their hands nine times a day - compared to just six prior to the pandemic. And % intend to stick to their new routine and habits even when the lockdown period is over, with a third claiming they will always be more anxious of germs and hygiene from now on.Nicola Smuts-Allsop, founder of Fulvisafe, said: The nation is more aware of combating germs since the coronavirus outbreak and it is clear people have changed their everyday routines to stay as safe as possible.With the statistics showing people will stick to their new routine for at least a few months - and an eighth of people for up to a year - this paints a picture of the new normal for many. Hand sanitizer, facemasks and gloves are now handbag essentials but there is a lot of unknown around what products are in many sanitizers and how safe they are to be using continuously.  Our new hand sanitizer and barrier cream both protect and moisturise throughout the day while being alcohol-free and safe to use on babies. The research also found a third of Brits have cleaned their house more often with  per cent wiping down surfaces more regularly. And % have even increased the number of showers they have. More than half now take hand sanitizer out with them when they leave the house, %carry gloves and three in  always have anti-bacterial wipes on them. Similarly, % take tissues out with them and one in  even pack a change of clothes. But with % of respondents washing their hands for at least  seconds nowadays, a quarter have suffered with dry and cracked hands and  per cent have been moisturising them more regularly. Almost half have noticed that using alcohol-based sanitizer has had a detrimental effect on their skin and % have reduced their use of it as a result.  More than one in  are anxious about the amount of alcohol used in hand sanitizing products and % would like to know more about the ingredients used. It also emerged a sixth of those polled, via OnePoll, are worried about the long-term damage on their skin due to washing their hands more often. And of those surveyed who are parents, a quarter have struggled to find hygiene products which are safe and gentle for their child since the coronavirus outbreak. Nicola Smuts-Allsop added: The research shows that people are finding that the high levels of alcohol in some sanitizers is damaging their skin, as result many are not washing their hands as long or as often. Fulvisafe is kind to skin, even for babies. Fulivsafe, contains a new hero ingredient CHD-FA, which has been scientically proven to inhibit influenzaaposs like coronavirus, kills  per cent of germs and has no bleaches or harmful chemicals.  Top things which are part of the new normal for Brits: . Washing your hands for at least  seconds . Shouting aposthanksapos to delivery people down the path . Avoiding touching your face . Going supermarket shopping alone . Crossing the roadyou see people walking towards them . Cleaning door handles . Walking in the middle of the road to avoid other people .

Businesses will be expected to adhere to the new one metre plus rule, and some branches will be operating reduced trading times. But how do you feel about pubs reopening  Will you be enjoying a pint or two on Saturday  Or do you feel it is too risky to go to your local  Have your say by taking part in the survey New safety measures will be in place when boozers reopen on Saturday, such as increased outdoor drinking and a reduced bar service in place. Pub chain Wetherspoons plans to reopen all  of its venues on Saturday after owner Tim Martin revealed it was spending £ million introducing a raft of changes to its pubs to ensure they were coronavirus-safe. Boris Johnson said there will be minimal staff and customers will be asked to order via apps to reduce social contact when boozers reopen. In venues where two metres isnapost possible, customers will be allowed sit one metre apart so long as measures are put into place, such as back-to-back seating, perspex screens and partitions between tables. There will also be disposable menus and one-in-one-out queues for washrooms. Customers will also be asked to share their contact details at the entrance thanks to a new partnership with the NHSaposs test and trace initiative. Despite Mr Johnson giving pubs the green light to reopen, many will stay shut over safety fears. Among them are Sunderland bars Ttonic, Chaplins, The Point, Glitter Ball and Arizona, which say they want to put safety first. In a statement, their management team said the intensity expected... isnapost worth putting our team under unnecessary risk and stress. t continued: Our safety, your safety and to protect the emergency services from unnecessary duress we think is paramount and the responsible thing to do in our much loved city.  We will not be opening until further notice and remain closed this weekend.Meanwhile, Ian High, operations and finance director of Pub Culture, which runs venues in the North East including the Dun Cow in Sunderland, told the Sunderland Echo : The health and safety of our staff and customers is our top priority.We are working through the guidelines provided for the hospitality industry and want to make sure that when we open, we are providing the safest possible environment.Meanwhile, emergency services are preparing for a weekend that could be as busy as New Yearaposs Eve. Police federation leaders warned that the public will be out in droves on July , with one fearing ato Accident and Emergency departments resembling a circus full of drunken clowns at weekends. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson yesterday said: I am in favour of the gradual lting of the lockdown, based on the science, but not in the way the Government have proceeded. It would have been sensible for the Government to schedule the first day of pub openings for midweek or the Monday afterwards, rather than a Saturday.

The good news is the government has given permission for hotels with en suite showering facilities, or one designated shower facility per guest room, to reopen. But it has issued strict guidelines for owners to follow in order to keep staff and visitors safe and stop the spread of Covid-. The seven key new rules are designed to help employers, employees and the self-employed in England only understand how to work as safely as possible and protect their customers while keeping to the recommended social distancing guidance applicable at the time. Below are the seven vital changes you will notice next time you stay at a hotel in England...plus we speak to a hotel in Glasgow to see how they have been adapting during the crisis. . Screens in reception  Hotels have been told to take measures to make reception areas safer, with increased cleaning, keeping the activity time as short as possible and where possible the addition of screens between guests and staff. . Lt limits Bosses have been told to consider minimising lt usage from reception, and urged to provide clear signage for new lt rules. . New room service delivery plans Where offering room service, the guidelines state measures such as dropping butler’s trays outside door should be introduced.

Social distancing at bars Owners must ensure that any bar or dining area is only opened in a way compliant with UK government guidance on the hospitality sector. Hotel supports hospital heroes with meals  When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Laura McKenzie had a flood of cancelled bookings at her Glasgow hotel, Cathedral House. The McKenzie family had spent  months building up business at the boutique hotel, which offers a luxurious “home from home” atmosphere, so they were shattered. But within days Laura, who runs the hotel with husband Shane and two of their children Callum,  and -year-old Anna, was inspired to help out staff at nearby Glasgow Royal Infirmary. First, they block booked rooms for hospital staff at a reduced rate then with the help of a donation from Celtic FC Foundation, set to work making meals for them. “I made a few phone calls and straightaway we had the team we needed to start producing the meals. It was probably ten days from thinking: ‘This is horric, this is the end’ to thinking ‘We can do something good and support the local hospital here.’” Laura knows the pressure that NHS staff are under because her daughter, Emily, , is a junior doctor in Dundee, so she was desperate to help. With the hotel’s staff all on furlough, Laura assembled a team of volunteer chefs from the city. The Red Onion’s patron chef John Quigley was one of the first to volunteer and Laura worked with the head nurse at the Infirmary to set up the menu.  “We decided we were going to do  meals a day,” she says. “We did  veggie options and  meat options and bought little takeaway tubs and labelled them all up with little stickers that said: ‘With love from Cathedral House’. And every night at quarter to seven the driver from the hospital would come and take the big boxes of food away. He said there was always such a buzz. People were like: ‘Oh, the food’s coming! What have we got today ’” The hotel has now delivered more than , dishes such as jambalaya, bangers and mash and Thai curry. “It was a simple menu, all cooked fresh with lots of veggies and the sort of dishes you’d cook for yourself when you get home from work,” says Laura. Doctors staying at the hotel were delighted because Laura would text them to seethey wanted a dinner putting aside – and they could pop down to the kitchen to collect it. Laura’s home-from-home hospitality was a real comfort to her guests."},{"url":null,"title":"inside creepy abandoned dentists surgery","story":"NewsInside creepy abandoned dentists surgery with equipment left untouched for  yearsThe dentist is understood to have died in the late s and no one wants to buy the property which now resembles the set of a horror film because of its haunting pastShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JUL NewsCreepy photos show the inside of an abandoned dental surgery \", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Time has stood still for the once bustling surgery with images showing the abandoned mansion littered with medical supplies, patient records and decaying surgical equipment. The dentist is understood to have died in the late s after suffering personal problems and the last cigarettes he smoked and the bottle of wine he drank are still laid out on the dining room table. The house, in a Belgian village, is like walking into a horror film - and not the sort of place youaposd want to get your teeth checked. The images are a spine-tingling reminder that the house was once a home and has now become popular with urban explorers. The pictures were taken by a British explorer at the weekend, who visited to record the houseaposs eerie contents. It is understood the dentist lost his licence in  and slumped into a depression, taking his own le three years later. But the house looks asit hasnapost been touched since at least the decade before. A waiting room lies tidy, waiting for patients to enter, while the old dentist chair is still in place, complete with dental moulds, newspapers from  and medical books stacked high alongside patient records.  The urban explorer who visited said: Itaposs a huge mansion behind these ft black metal gates and itaposs very, very sinister looking. The dentist lived there with his we and kids and he was a regular dentist and GP and he had it all in his house. He got into financial trouble and his we left him. I was told he also lost his medical licence but did not tell his patients.  He went on: The neighbours said he used to do appointments for a third of the price of anyone  but was using -year-old equipment and thataposs why people complained. Bedrooms are filled with perfectly clean and folded bedlinen while a chandelier hangs above one bed. Hundreds of items of clothing are crammed into wardrobes alongside shoes that seem to be from the s or s. But the eeriest thing at the mansion in East Flanders is the dentistaposs room.  There were drills and pain relief, with an alternative to chloroform, said the urban explorer. The basement was absolutely full of medical books. And there was a lot of beautul stuff left. A letter dated from  appears to have been written to the dentistaposs cousins.  Even the manaposs hat was left on the arm of a chair in the marbled hallway. He apparently had no family and his body was found in the lounge in . No-one wants to buy it because of its history and the villagers want it demolished, he added.

One of hundreds of migrant workers employed at the plant, he works for - hours a week on a cold, damp production line with poor ventilation. While some colleagues have recently been issued with visors, very few wear masks, and the protective screening promised by Alex’s employers has yet to arrive. “They are putting people at risk,” he says.He asked us not to name him or his employer as he said people who had spoken out had lost their jobs. Alex and his housemates recently tested for coronavirus using home testing kits after colleagues began falling ill. He had no symptoms but the result turned out to be positive. “I had to go on statutory sick pay,” explains Alex, who has been employed at the factory for five years, after coming to the UK from Romania. “That’s £ a week. Our rent is around £ a week for a room.The company did nothing to help people who might be experiencing hardship. We just had to try our best to survive on £ a week. “Friends helped with food. All the company is bothered about is that we can produce, and their profit. “People have been in hospital for three weeks with Covid, and the company has paid them nothing.” Now he’s back on a production line where some colleagues have felt forced to come to work when they’re ill. “Loss of taste and smell is a symptom, but people are still going into work with that – because they are too afraid to lose the money, to slip into hardship,” he says. “We get £ a week so it is impossible to save. No one can afford to lose their job.About three-quarters of the people here are foreigners so they are scared to lose their jobs.” Around  cases of Covid have been discovered in the last few days at food factories in towns including Merthyr Tydfil, Wrexham and Llangefni in Wales, and Cleckheaton in West Yorks. The outbreak in Leicester has been linked to the prevalence of “fast fashion” factories in the city.Yesterday, a bed factory in Batley, which is near Cleckheaton, also reported a number of cases. Meanwhile, Bradford, Barnsley and Rochdale, the three towns with the next highest number of new cases after Leicester, also have high numbers of people in insecure, low-paid, often zero hours, work. Some of the factories worst hit employ large percentages of migrant labour. In normal times, these are vulnerable and easily exploited workforces. Yet so far, instead of strengthening support for these workers and targeting unscrupulous employers, the Government’s only response has been a dog-whistle suggestion by the Prime Minister that Leicester has had “particular” problems “understanding” Government advice. As Unite the Union’s national officer for food, drink and agriculture Bev Clarkson says: “Exploitation driven by ­corporate greed is a major factor in the public health emergencies amongst meat processing plants here and in other countries.  “There is a real danger, however, that migrant workers – many of whom simply cannot afford to be ill because their employers refuse adequate sick pay – will prove to be an easy target for those looking to sht the blame where. “Employers must not be allowed to escape responsibility for the dire working conditions, low pay and insecure employment that blight the meat processing industry, and which have now come back to bite the nation’s efforts to defeat the coronavirus.” Unite conducted a survey this week in one of the factories with a serious outbreak.  It found .% of staff had worked while unwell, and % had chosen not to self-isolate when someone in their household was showing symptoms. One worker said that even after a temperature check showed they had a fever, they were still told to get ­themselves into work. “A guy on our line was in hospital with Covid,” the worker said. “Another was off with it and was toldanyone asks, he was ill because of the air conditioning.” Other workers told Unite: “I’m afraid, but I can’t not come into work” “People going up and down the line have to push past each other. There’s nothing being done to keep social distance on the shop floor” “Some people are coming in sick at work because they can’t afford to lose money” “We didn’t have soaps or hand sanitiser for more than two months and they still forced us to keep working.”  A worker said thatthey complained they were told “go home forever”. Another colleague said: “Because we are not British people, the majority are Eastern Europeans, we are worth nothing for them.” Another said: “Furloughed staff receive % of their salary, yetwe go to work as ‘key workers’ and become sick we only get £ a week. That doesn’t sound like being a key worker it sounds like we’re The Expendables.” Like many migrant workers, Alex lives in accommodation he shares with others from the same factory. The outbreak has left many of these households with no one bringing home more than their rent.

The papers form part of The Duchess of Sussexaposs legal action against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over articles which featured parts of a private and confidential handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The relationship between the pair broke down completely when, during the wedding week, he was embroiled in controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi. In the documents, leaked last night and dated June , the former actress and humanitarian claims she spent her own money on hotels and flights to fly Mr Markle to and from London for her wedding. She also mentions Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie in the new submissions as she points out they undertake paid work. And she describes how her friends were concerned about her mental health while pregnant. Meghan, , who married Harry, , in May  and whom she shares one-year-old son Archie Harrison with, is suing Associated Newspapers over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline. Here are the new court document claims... . aposMeghan had no idea about friendsapos People Magazine interviewapos In February , five of the Duchessaposs friends spoke anonymously to the US publication, People. The interview described the bullying the royal said she faced, and highlighted Mr Markleaposs letter. The document states: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. However, Meghan has claimed she did not know her friends would be speaking to People and was not aware of the contents of the article until it was published. The Duchessaposs five friends are not named in the documents but referred to as A-E, although they are identied in an undisclosed confidential schedule. The magazine only referred to the pals as being in “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. The report highlighted Meghanaposs handwritten letter to her father, with a confidant telling the American publication about its content.  The friend said: Sheaposs like, aposDad, Iaposm so heartbroken. I love you. I have one father. Please stop victimising me through the media so we can repair our relationshipapos. Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. She was distressed when she read it. The documents state: She learned that an article about her was due to appear shortly before it was published. The Claimant [Meghan] was not informed that the article would be in People magazine, or what its contents would be. She was aware that her friends were deeply worried for her mental health as a result of her treatment by the UK tabloid media, particularly by the Defendant [Associate Newspapers]. The Claimant did not know that her Letter to her father would be referred to.  Meghan’s lawyers also state in the court filings that the Duchess “discussed with Friend A that she was writing a letter to her father at the time of penning it, which was seven months before the article was published. Friend A has been personally known to Mr Markle, a retired lighting director, for more than  years. Meghan phoned friend A after the article appeared to express her distress at its publication and contents, the court papers claimed. . aposFriends were worried about Meghanaposs mental healthapos The court documents state how at the beginning of , following visits by friends to see her in London, some of her close circle of friends became extremely concerned at the aggressive attacks upon her in the media. Meghan was told by one of her friends they were extremely worried about her mental health. It adds: Especially as she was vulnerable as well as heavily pregnant at the time. As a result, one of her closest friends decided that they should help by arranging to give anonymous interviews to this American magazine... The papers continue: As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself. . aposDidnapost state in letter she felt her father has victimised herapos  Meghan has also claimed she did not state in her letter that she felt her father had “victimised” her, nor did she state that she had “only one father” as People reported. Instead, the Duchess claims she raised concern that her father had consistently allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media. The document reads: The Claimant did not state in her Letter that she felt her father had “victimised” her, nor did she state that she had “only one father” as is reported in the interview. Instead, she raised concern that he had consistently allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media, despite her trying to persuade him not to speak to them for his own good, and rightly so. . aposMeghan told friends and members of Royal Family about letterapos  The legal papers also state that she had told friends and members of the Royal Family about the letter to her father. However, she had only discussed the contents with Harry, her mother Doria Ragland, two friends, the Kensington Palace Communications Team and her solicitor, she claims. The papers read: The Claimant requested the Letter to be sent via her trusted business manager , rather than from the UK address where the Claimant resided, in order to lessen the risk of the Letter being intercepted, and that a copy of the Letter be provided to her US lawyer for safe keepingon the understanding that he would not read its contents. This illustrates the s to which the Claimant went to keep the Letter private, as it was meant to be. . Meghan aposunprotected by the Institutionapos  In one of the more explosive claims, Meghan claimed to have felt unprotected by the institution of the monarchy. However, well placed Palace insider said last night: “It is clear Meghan is not pulling any punches in her pursuit of this trial. “The Royal Family will be absolutely dismayed at the assertion she was unprotected by the institution which is a bold claim. “The Queen, Prince Charles and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge all went out of their way to make her feel welcome and will be hugely disappointed these allegations are being made so forcefully.” . Kensington Palaceaposs aposno commentapos  When People Magazine approached Kensington Palace for a comment on the interview they were told aposno commentapos. Meghan claims she was not asked for comment by the KP Communications Team in relation to this media inquiry or its subsequent dealings with the media. The documents state: The stance of aposno commentapos was taken by the KP Communications Team without any discussion with or approval by the Claimant, as is standard practice for Royal communications. Had the Claimant been asked or been given the opportunity to participate, she would have asked the KP Communications Team to say on the record that she had not been involved with the People magazine article, as she had not been. It continues: It was mandated by the KP Communications Team that all friends and family of the Claimant should say ‘no comment’ when approached by any media outlet, despite misinformation being provided to UK tabloids about the Claimant. This shared frustration amongst the Claimant’s friends left everyone feeling silenced, as it appeared that other so-called sources were able to disseminate  statements about the Claimant, while the people who knew her best were told that they needed to remain silent. The Claimant believes that it is probably because of this reason, as well as concerns about the press intrusion by the UK tabloids, that a few friends chose to participate and they did so anonymously. . Harry broke the news to Meghan about the People Magazine interview Meghan was informed of the article by Prince Harry immediately after he had been told by the KP Communications Team. Meghan initially did not know which of her friends had been involved and only found this information out some considerable time later, the court documents state. . Spotlight on Princesses Eugenie, Beatrice and Prince Michael of Kent  Princesses Eugenie, Beatrice and Prince Michael of Kent have also been named in the court documents. The Duchess was responding to a claim that Royal Family members donapost work when she singled out the two sisters and Prince Michael of Kent. The documents state: It is this denial by the Defendant which was gratuitous and wrong, as several ‘member[s] of the Royal Family’ do, in fact, ‘undertake paid work’ including, for example, Princess Beatrice of York, Princess Eugenie of York and Prince Michael of Kent. Meghan and Harry stepped down as senior members of the Royal Family earlier this year. At the time, the couple stated on their website they wanted to become financially independent. . Wedding aposwas not publicly fundedapos - and generated £b in tourism revenue  Meghan has stated that that at the time of the Articles being published she was a working member of the Royal family and to someextent publicly funded. The document states that any personal travel costs were always independently and privately funded by Meghan and Harry. It also claims the Royal wedding in May  at Windsor Castle was not publicly funded, but personally financed by Harryaposs father, Prince Charles. The document adds: Any public costs incurred for the wedding were solely for security and crowd control to protect members of the public, as deemed necessary by Thames Valley Police and the politan Police. This contribution of public funds towards crowd security was far outweighed by the tourism revenue of over one billion pounds sterling that was generated from the Royal wedding of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex which went directly into the public purse. This figure has been previously refuted by consulting firm Brand Finance, MailOnline reports, with a figure of £million closer to the mark. . Meghanaposs communication with father  The legal filing states Meghan made many calls to her father during the week of the wedding, from Nottingham Cottage, as well as from wedding rehearsals and pre-wedding events in Windsor and from Windsor Castle, all of which were ignored or declined. It adds: The facts remain that: the Claimant called her father multiple times during the week of the wedding , that she did not change her phone number, nor block his number from calling her, that Mr Markle did not call or text the Claimant since the week of the wedding, and that he did suggest taking a photo in public with his daughter for the media. She denies blocking Mr Markleaposs phone calls after the wedding. . aposFive phone calls after Mr Markle had cardiac issuesapos Meghan claims once her father informed her via text message he was having cardiac issues, she phoned him on at least five occasions on th May at . on th May at . on th May at . on th May at . and on th May at .. She also states in the court filings she sent numerous texts, used Harryaposs phone to call her father, as well as using the Buckingham Palace switchboard. The court papers read: When Mr Markle publicly announced that he fell ill, the Claimant sent a security team to take him to hospital , and subsequently to go to his hospital to drive him home safely once he was discharged , as all her close friends and colleagues were already in transit to the UK for the wedding.  The court papers say: The Letter was not an attack on her father or intended as such. It was a private and deeply personal expression to him of her feelings and an attempt to remind him of some facts pertaining to their personal relationship. It adds: The stated intention of the Claimant in writing the Letter to her father was not because she felt he had victimised her but to seek to convey to him how he had allowed himself to be manipulated by the tabloid media, including the Defendant, despite trying to persuade him not to do so , and the impact which this had caused on their relationship, as well as on him, and, most importantly, how he should try to avoid it in the future. The intention of the Letter was to make him stop his actions it was not an attempt at reconciliation. This will be amplied in the Claimant’s witness statement. . Meghan paid for dadaposs flights and hotel accommodation for wedding  Meghan states in the court filings that made arrangements for and booked the flights to London and back for her father using her own money ahead of her wedding to Prince Harry. It also states in the legal filings that she made arrangements for him to have complete custom outfits for the wedding week including a morning suit and dinner suits. It adds that it entailed arranging an appointment with a professional tailor in Los Angeles for her father’s measurements to be taken - which he attended - and then for professional tailors in London and Canada to make the suitsso that they would be ready for him when he came over for the wedding. It claims she used a pseudonym so it would lessen the risk of media intrusion for him. The papers read: The Claimant took care to consider and to organise everything her father may need from all clothing items for each scheduled event, to accommodations, all transports, and a dedicated assistant on the ground to be with him during his time in the UK. Meghan also arranged for Mr Markle to stay at an apartment suite in the town of Brentwood in Los Angeles County for three nights ahead of his flight for the wedding but he would not get into the car” that had arrived to collect him. . Thomas Markle has never met Prince Harry or Archie The court documents confirm Thomas Markle has never met Prince Harry or the coupleaposs son, Archie - Mr Markleaposs grandson - in person. Mr Markle has had communication with Harry over the phone. Why is Meghan suing  The duchess is suing Associated Newspapers over five articles, two in the Mail on Sunday and three on MailOnline, which were published in February  and reproduced parts of a handwritten letter she sent to Mr Markle, , in August .  Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights.

In a series of statements made in legal papers submitted to the High Court, the -year-old noted that the royal sisters retain their titles while working. The Duchess was responding to claims made in documents that she was a member of the royal family and does not undertake paid work”. Meghan questioned the suggestion by pointing to Beatrice and Eugenie, along with Prince Michael of Kent. The latter royal runs a consultancy business, while Eugenie worked at an online auction firm before becoming a director at the London art gallery Hauser  Wirth. Beatrice has worked at venture capital firm Sandbridge and later software company Afiniti, where she is currently employed as the Vice President of Partnerships  Strategy. Meghanaposs assertion was made as part of a lawsuit she is bringing against Associated Newspapers Limited , the owner of The Mail On Sunday newspaper and MailOnline. The former actress has raised issues with five articles, which included reproduced parts of a handwritten note she had sent to her father in August . Meghan claims her dad’s decision to make the letter public breached her privacy,and data protection rights. In a major development this evening it emerged in confidential papers that Meghan not only identied her pals who spoke anonymously to People magazine, but insisted she didn’t know they were doing so.  Meghan said she did not know about the interview having been given, and only found out about it, and any reference to the Letter, after the People magazine article was published. The friends have never been named, with the magazine only referring to them as “Meghanaposs inner circle – a longtime friend, a former co-star, a friend from LA, a one-time colleague and a close confidante”. They are detailed as friends A, B, C, D and E in redacted documents but named in confidential papers submitted to the court.

Danielle Gardener is now a size  and says her weight gain has improved her mental health and most importantly improved her relationship with her children Noah, eight, and Leah, two. The -year-old social media influencer says her confidence was at an all time low as a size  as she aposdespisedapos herself which had a negative impact on her day-to-day le. She praises her own weight gain for benefiting her mental health and opening the door to modelling opportunities and says she is focused on her future and being a aposhappyapos mum. Danielle, from Hornchurch, Essex, said: I hated myself when I was slim as the negative comments from bullies such as aposuglyapos and aposfatapos chipped away at my confidence until I had nothing left. I thought I was fat and disgusting - I despised myself. I was depressed and angry at the world but now I feel so happy after embracing my curves. My relationship with my children has improved massively as Iaposm happy and I am always in a good mood and never let peopleaposs opinions bring me down. I want to build a career that makes them proud and show them that you are beautul, no matter what size you are. Kids pick up on everything andthey hear their mum putting herself down because of her appearance they are going to start questioning their own and I donapost want my children to ever feel like that.  I have stopped spending time worrying about my weight and now we are able to go to the beach or swimming without me worrying or hiding my body. We now have fun without limits and seeing them happy is all that matters. Danielle insists she is healthy and is not promoting obesity as she regularly exercises.She adds: I have been told I am promoting obesity but Iaposm not sitting on Instagram filling my face with fast food saying aposbe fatapos.Iaposm also not promoting diet pills or quick ways to loose weight that arenapost good for the body. I go to the gym four times a week, swim and eat a healthy balanced diet. Iaposm using my  to promote body positivity so other donapost feel like I did for all those years. My confidence didnapost grow overnight, it has taken almost two years for me to get to where I am today but I have never been happier. I look at photos of myself as a size  and remember how miserable I was but now I am bigger but in a much better place.  I used to hide from the camera but now I promote lingerie and bikini brands online - I am proud of my body and showing others, they should be too. Danielle feels there will aposalways be a fightapos about how a woman should look but thanks kind strangers online for positive comments and accepting her appearance. She said: There will always be pressure to look a certain way and there is still brands who wonapost use you or they want a plus size model who is a size  with a flat stomach.  Whilst others are happy for you to embrace your curves and give other plus size women the confidence to do the same. Danielle has recently entered a competition launched by Models of Diversity whoaposve collaborated with Yours clothing brand.

Akira Gujadhur, , has a rare eating disorder that means she canapost eat anything other than bite-sized chunks of chicken. Her consultant at St Thomasapos Hospital in London even wrote a letter to KFC asking them to give the family a supply of frozen popcorn chicken to help get her through lockdown. Akiraaposs parents Raj and Hem spend thousands of pounds on buying her takeaways twice a day and Akira used to get them delivered at her old school. But the tot is due to start at a new school that specialises in teaching autistic children and staff wonapost allow the KFC meals on the premises. Mr Gujadhur said he has been left in the position where his daughter either starves at school or he quits his job so he can pick her up every lunchtime to take her to KFC. Akira has Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder, which started after she suffered a severe throat infection at eight months old that stopped her eating. Doctors advised putting dferent foods in front of her until she selected something. She chose a piece of popcorn chicken and has refused to eat anything  since. She is given vitamins to ensure she gets sufficient nutrients. Her old school could no longer cater for Akiraaposs special educational needs so her parents secured her a place at Portfield School in Christchurch, Dorset. The Gujadhurs appealed the schoolaposs decision not to allow KFC on the premises but lost their case at a local authority tribunal hearing.  Mr Gujadhur, a senior actuarial analyst for finance firm Capita, said: We are very upset by how we have been treated. I think the school is acting so irresponsibly. Akiraaposs old school was a mainstream school and were feeding her the popcorn chicken with no problem at all. But it cost around £, a year and the local authority basically said food is not part of her educational needs so they could not pay for it anymore. Portfield School have said they are happy to offer her a place but donapost want her to eat popcorn chicken because itaposs fast food and they say she needs to eat healthily. I just donapost understand it because itaposs a specialist school for people like Akira who have additional needs. Akira canapost speak and she doesnapost understand.  The local authority is saying she canapost go to school without food but the school is saying she canapost eat the only thing she eats, at school. The tribunal seem to basically be saying itaposs the parentsapos problem. They are sayingwe feel she canapost stay at school without food, we will have to go every lunchtime, pick her up, feed her and bring her back. The school is  minutes from my work and weaposre not allowed to feed her at the school, weaposd have to take her KFC or take her home to feed her then bring her back. My we doesnapost drive and I canapost take hours out of work. The only alternative is to starve her at school. Theyaposre not being helpful at all. Weaposve got friends who have children there. One of them only eats sausages and she is allowed to bring sausages to school but they wonapost let Akira have popcorn chicken.  How can they force her not to eat the only thing she has been eating for the last five years  If they said she could eat at school we would be happy to pay for the deliveries and I donapost see how it would affect other children as once delivered it could be put into a lunchbox and look similar to any other lunch. The school doesnapost agree with takeaway food being brought into school or being eaten in front of other pupils. The school also raised concerns at the tribunal about the risk of allergens to other pupilsapos well-being. A spokesman for Portfield School, which is managed by Autism Wessex, said: At Autism Wessex, our top priority is the welfare and safety of all of our students and service users, and at no point would we allow any child or young adult to be put at risk of harm.

She had received a notication through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security. The video she was sent had no audio, but when she ed home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the aposweirdapos incident in Delaware. And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order. Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled aposDo we need any additional instructions to find this address apos, her son had written: No but knock on the door  times and scream abra cadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away. Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van - exactly as instructed.Itaposs had more than two million views and , shares after Lynn posed it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her sonaposs instructions, with the caption: Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman! Apparently, my youngest son had put some aposadditional instructionsapos for delivery and she went along with it. It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.  I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldnapost.

But those piling pressure on the US corporate superpower and billionaire founder Mark Zuckerberg this time aren’t its usual long list of critics, such as privacy campaigners and those who believe the giant doesn’t pay anything like enough tax.Some of the world’s biggest companies - from Starbucks to Ford, Adidas to Lego, Coca-Cola to Ben  Jerry’s ice cream - are among more than  to pull advertising from Facebook for the whole of the month of July.It follows claims by campaigners that Facebook has been too slow and reluctant to remove hateful content. A third of the globe’s top  ad spenders will either join the month-long blackout, or are likely to do so, according to the World Association of Advertisers. For Facebook, whose rise from start-up in  to a £billion giant, this appears to be a big problem. Yet words from Zuckerberg today suggest he is not overly concerned. “My guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the  soon enough” the chief executive is quoted as telling staff. “We’re not going to change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue.” While it is perhaps best known for friends, families and colleagues keeping in touch, Facebook is also an advertising monster.  It earns over % of its revenues from ads, which brought in £billion last year. Calls to pause Facebook advertising began on June , when a coalition of groups, led by the US Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People launched a campaign, following protests over the death in the US of George Floyd who died after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.There have also been reports that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle asked US civil rights group Stop Hate for Profit to name companies they could “help target” in dissuading advertisers from using the social network throughout July.Stop Hate for Profit claims on its website that Facebook “allowed incitement to violence against protesters fighting for racial justice in America”.Facebook also came under fire for keeping up a post by US President Donald Trump which said “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, during the Black Lives Matter protests.Mr Zuckerberg has agreed to meet campaign organisers and discuss their demands to end “hate, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism and violence” on the .  Steve Hatch, Facebook’s vice president for northern Europe, said there is “no tolerance on our  for hate speech” but that the debates around such issues are “extremely challenging”. Facebook has launched an advertising campaign of its own to improve people’s awareness of fake news shared online, and encouraging users to question what they see. Sir Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and now Facebook’s firm’s global affairs chief, published an open letter to the ad world. In it, he attempted to downplay fears the company had not done enough to combat hate. The big business backlash is unlikely to derail the Facebook juggernaut on its own. The top  brands that advertise on Facebook account for only around % of the company’s revenue in . Most of the money comes from its army of eight million other, smaller, advertisers. But it comes amid growing demands to rein in Facebook and Google ’s advertising dominance.A year-long investigation by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority called this week for a new regulatory regime. Around £billion was spent on online advertising in , it said, equivalent to about £ per household. About % of that goes to Google and Facebook. Facebook’s average revenue per user has increased from less than £ in  to over £ in . Google and Facebook’s advertising stranglehold was also having a “profound impact” on newspapers, said the CMA. It found nearly % of newspapers’ online traffic came via Google and Facebook. The regulator’s report said: “Greater competition to Google and Facebook can as a result be expected to improve the quality and accuracy of journalism, and see a decline in the prevalence of so called ‘fake news’.” Big tech firms have shrugged off previous boycotts.  An this time round while news of the Facebook advertising snub initially wiped billions from the stock market value, it has largely recovered. The ban has also largely been in the US. But anger at Facebook’s alleged failure to tackle hate speech only adds to mounting anger at the firm. The UK arm of Facebook paid just £.million in corporation tax in  - despite notching record turnover of £.billion. But while its tax bill was up from £.million in , critics said it was still not paying its fair share as some ad sales are still being funnelled offshore. One of Facebook’s not-so secret weapons is the treasure trove of personal information it holds on its billions of users.It is this which makes Facebook and its subsidiaries Instagram and Whatsapp so addictive for advertisers.Prising Facebook’s grip on that data, forcing it to be more transparent with the information it holds, could be harder to achieve.

The  GTO, built between  and , is the firmaposs most iconic model, raced in period by the biggest names in motorsport. Only  were built and they are regarded as the aposHoly Grailapos of cars, with only the super-rich able to afford the £million-plus asking price they command on the classic car market. Ferrari had the shape trademarked, but the Italian sports car company has lost the right following a legal battle against a bespoke car manufacturer from the same city of Modena. Ferrari have, however, maintained the trademark for making toy vehicles. Ares Design took Ferrari to the Cancellation Division of the European Union Intellectual Protection Office, arguing Ferrari had not put the contested trademark to genuine use for a continuous period of five years. According to EUIPO documents, lawyers acting for Ares Design said the trademark - which Ferrari has held since  - had been filed in bad faith, namely, as a defensive mark in order to block third parties to produce and sell similarly built sports cars. At the centre of the case was aposArticle  EUTMRapos, where a European Union trademark can be revoked , within a continuous period of five years, the trademark has not been put to genuine use.This aposuse it or lose itapos argument was the same point used last year by Irish fast food chain Supermacs when it successfully fought McDonaldaposs over the trademark aposBig Macapos. Ares Design argued that Ferrari had not put the contested design to use since  and that when they filed for the EU trademark in , they had no intention to use it. Despite protestations from Ferrari, the EU sided with the applicant, potentially paving the way for other companies to build copycat vehicles or modern interpretations of the Ferrari  GTO. In the published decision, the report stated: In the present case, the Cancellation Division considers that genuine use of the contested EUTM has been sufficiently demonstrated for the relevant factors in relation to toy vehicles, scale-model vehicles, whereas no use of the mark or proper reasons for non-use have been demonstrated in relation to any of the other goods in Class for which it is registered.

He really liked the club and the region where the club are based. It was just a good fit between the club and Steve himself.#Our area in Holland is full of people who are down to earth and Steve loved that. He#d gone from the pressure of getting the sack from England and all the attention that carried with it, to a small region in the east of Holland which is very quiet and he relished that.#The club was well run and well organised. You can ask anyone in Enschede and they all have nothing but positive things to say about Steve.#Hopefully, it will be the same with him and Dundee United too.#Brama says McClaren wouldn’t go into Tannadice and make wholesale changes – and he raved about the former Middlesbrough manager#s man-management skills.He recalled: #Steve had two periods with us as manager and, of course, he won us the league for the first time in our history in his first time at the club.#Him being manager made it a very, very positive experience for me.#When he first came in, the important thing for him was not to change everything straight away. In the beginning, he didn#t change a lot of things, he just observed.#He also didn#t bring in his own coaches, he kept the very good Dutch coaches we had at the club. He had Erik ten Hag, who is now Ajax manager, at the club as a coach and Alfred Schreuder as his assistant manager, who went on to manage Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga.#So he used the coaches who were there and their knowledge and allowed the coaches here to do their job without interference and that certainly helped too.#He was a great manager for us. He was liked and respected by the players, coaches, everyone at the club in a very good way. He was the boss and everyone knew it.#For me as a player, he was fantastic. I was out of the team when Steve arrived because there were two new players who were in my position.#But he played me in a game against Arsenal in Europe when he needed a more defensive midfielder and I played just about every game since then.#He could trust me. I was only  at the time and I liked that he showed enough confidence in me as a young player to discuss tactics with me.#It was a very Dutch way to work and it was another example of how he adapted. He wanted to integrate with the Dutch way of playing, training and thinking and that#s what made him a big success.#Hopefully, he will be as big a success at Dundee United as he was at Twente.#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Malky Mackay#s past mistakes are well-documented#he deserves the chance to be Dundee United manager# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-malky-mackay-dundee-united embed # secretlLVCwFjUQ\" data-secret\"lLVCwFjUQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side. It shows contempt for all of us who have stuck by the rules to protect our lives and the lives of others.Boris Johnson has asked us to #move on# but this issue will not go away. This is a wound that will continue to fester.Dominic Cummings continues to be a major player in government decisions and rules, those rules he so shamelessly flaunted without even an apology.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

have seen large gatherings of youths, sometimes more than  at a time, at ious locations around the county.The vast majority of these are all well behaved but a small minority have been engaging in signicant anti-social behaviourand disorder.North Berwick, Tranent and Longniddry have caused us some issues recently, with intoxicated youths verbally abusing passers-by, vandalising items, smashing bottles and leaving a mess behind. This is not acceptable.East Lothian Countryside Rangers have reported a signicant rise in rubbish, empty alcohol bottles, broken tents and ious other items on our beaches and parks.When you visit the coastal areas, you expect it to be clean, tidy and safe, and the Rangers do an exceptional job keeping up with the disgusting mess left behind.However, what they are now regularly cleaning up is way beyond what should ever be expected.During a clear up at Longniddry Bents last week,  canisters of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, were found discarded, along with hundreds of empty alcohol bottles. This appears to be a trend amongst youngsters, to get a temporary high, and as a parent of two young girls I find this extremely concerning.You may see these small finger-sized silver canisters in parks or discarded in the street.I wanted to provide some information on this gas to help you understand the risks so you can explain these to your children.Inhaling the gas slows down messages between the brain and body, causing temporary feelings of calmness and joy.Negative effects can include dizziness, headaches or fainting. It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement. Sometimes the user can see or hear things that arenrsquot real. The risks include it preventing the ability to breathe and, in extreme cases, death.It can cause the heart rate to beat irregularly, increasing the risk of heart failure, and heavy use has been linked to vitamin B deficiency which can cause nerve damage. The user can also become confused and panicky, which may lead to accidents.This is not something we want our children and young people experimenting with. This is a gas that dentists and medical professionals use under controlled conditions to sedate patients for minor medical procedures.I have arranged a multi-agency meeting to raise awareness of the risks and to prevent someone from becoming ill, injured or dying from this.Please talk to your children and discuss the dangers of these canisters and the impact of ASB.Eventhey havenrsquot been part of the group, they may know who has.

moves through the faint, outer part of earths shadow.A lunar eclipse happens when the Earth comes between the sun and the moon, therefore blocking some or all of the sunrsquos light from reaching the moon.Therefore, the moon cannot shine ndash because its surface is not reflecting the sunrsquos rays.The eclipse will be visible over ScotlandAccording to TimeAndDate, a penumbral lunar eclipse occurs when the sun, earth and moon are imperfectly aligned.When this happens, the earth blocks some of the sunrsquos light from directly reaching the moonrsquos surface, and covers all or part of the moon with the other part of its shadow.People in Scotland are urged to find an unobstructed area with a free sight to the southwest for a best view of the eclipse.Unlike solar eclipses, which can only be seen along a narrow path from a small part of the earth, eclipses of the moon can be observed all across the night side of earth when the eclipse happens.According to TimeAndDate, these are the local

Irsquove looked out my monthly cinema pass in anticipation of re-opening around July .I appreciate not everyone feels this way, but Irsquom ready to start living again. Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Speculation over testing or quarantining travellers between England and Scotland has been raised as part of a discussion of how to prevent infection from a neighbour with a higher incidence of Covid  than here. As a result, almost overnight the Border has begun to assume a signicance it has not held for centuries.:Thousands back petition to close Scottish border to all but essential trafficThis pandemic might one day be viewed as a textbook illustration of the geopolitical fault lines across the UK. What was once a united front has splintered into four distinct nations, each with a dferent solution to the same problem. Nothing more starkly demonstrates the gulf between the laissez-faire ethos of the Westminsterrsquos panjandrums and the commonsensical attitude at Holyrood than the ways in which they have eased restrictions.The increasingly relaxed English regime appears to be fuelled by wishful thinking rather than science the Scottish situation, meanwhile, is characterised by caution. Long before talk of checkpoints, this was already causing tension. When Englandrsquos routemap out of lockdown was weeks ahead of Scotland, John Lamont, Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said those of his constituents close to Borisrsquos bailiwick were confused. Why did one rule apply to their very near neighbours, and another to them The answer seemed obvious ndash it was far too soon to relax ndash but the question vividly demonstrated the nature of this area. Many who live where Hadrianrsquos men boldly marched have a foot in both countries. They might work in one, and live in the other, hail from this side and have relocated to that. They could have family and friends in either camp, who remained out of reach for so long as the Scottish government prohibited meeting.Those Border villagers who defied lockdown to visit a garden centre in Berwick were making a political rather than a horticultural statement. In this, they echoed attitudes since the days of the great reiving clans, who roamed freely on both banks of the Tweed. The Scottish and English kings were so appalled at the regionrsquos lawlessness that, despite being sworn enemies, they worked in tandem to subdue it.Given the way Borderers were treated by their lieges, itrsquos no surprise they thumbed their noses. These days, towns and villages are awash with folk from both sides, thereby creating a unique and strongly bonded region. Little wonder Unionism still pertains hereabouts.:Tourists from England could face -day quarantine in ScotlandCovid- cases flareThat there have been no deaths from Covid  in Scotland for the past few days suggests we are heading in the right direction. But there is a long way still to go. The First Ministerrsquos aim is to eradicate the virus, not merely contain it. Seeing the daily tally of new cases and deaths in England, she seeks confirmation that the Prime Minister has the same objective. But, as she said earlier this week, without such assurances she fears Englandrsquos strategy is ldquoletting it circulate at higher levels as long as it doesnrsquot threaten to overwhelm the NHS.If that is indeed the case, then monitoring passage between the countries is in some respects no dferent from policies implemented by a place like New Zealand. It initially imposed an outright ban on entry, followed later by quarantine on new arrivals. The problem is, as a devolved nation within a union, the consequences of such a step are potentially inflammatory. Some will view it as independence by stealth, a confrontational declaration of autonomy, or simply authoritarianism run rampant. Yet with a summer of staycations approaching, the repercussions of allowing untrammelled travel could be dire.Before the prospect of imposing controls was mooted, people around where I live in Roxburghshire have been scowling at visitors from only a few miles away, let alone the depths of the English shires. When a couple of walkers dared ask a neighbour directions over the hills last week, they narrowly avoided a tirade.The idea of the Border ing to its roots as a frontier inevitably creates a troubling sense of Them and Us, or Friend and Foe. Affront will be taken at any restriction on free transit between south and north. Presumably residents of Scotland who visit England will also be tested or quarantined on their , making it a two-way injunction. Suddenly a weekend break in Northumberland looks a lot less appealing.:YouGov Poll: Half of Conservative voters in England support English independenceYet how exactly would it work  Is it only tourists who will be checked, or will those travelling back and forth for work, be they lorry drivers or business reps, also be subject to testing  Will every road, rail and sea route across the Border from Berwick to Workington be patrolled  Might we see a surge in midnight crossings over no-manrsquos land and rivers, four-by-fours finally justying their existence and canoes retrofitted to ferry families plus their luggage across the Tweed As things stand, there have been no new cases of the virus in the Scottish Borders in two weeks. This beautul, windswept district is starting to feel like a cordon sanitaire, a buffer between the haves and,not precisely the have-nots, then a population beginning slowly but steadily to paralyse the disease.Given our reputation as one of the sickest countries in Europe, we need to take every precaution to protect lives. Reimposing the Border as a barrier and guard would not be popular, and the war-time and military resonances are unsettling. Yet, in light of the high risk of contagion still posed by parts of the south, in the short term it would make sense. If the first thing passengers see as they arrive is not a sig welcoming them to Scotland but an NHS squad, then for the first time since  ndash the last pitched battle between England and Scotland ndash the Border will have regained its old role as the countryrsquos first line of defence.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

That could be work for a trusted political appointee.:Agenda: Proposed new law could make JK Rowling a criminalIs it a good appointment  That is a more subjective question, and less fundamental. Mr Frostrsquos predecessors have been very senior diplomats, with deep grounding across Britainrsquos foreign policy and security concerns ndash former heads of the Diplomatic Service, Ambassadors in Washington, Paris, Permanent Representatives in Brussels, both to the EU and to Nato. Some have done more than one of these big jobs, in wide, senior international careers.Mr Frost is able and, importantly, has the Prime Ministerrsquos confidence. But his diplomatic career culminated in the important, but not central, ambassadorship to Denmark. He then ran the important, but not central, Scotch Whisky Association, and was special advisor to Mr Johnson, as a Foreign Secretary who earned mixed reviews. Judging Mr Frostrsquos role as chief Brexit negotiator may be premature. But it is odd, after the justied criticism of Sir Mark Sedwillrsquos being both Cabinet Secretary and National Security Adviser, that Mr Frost should have to combine the climax of Brexit negotiations with whatever Middle Eastern politics, for instance, or terrorism, may serve up in the coming months.Choosing the new Cabinet Secretary matters more.

The help should be extended to include not only the most-high risk but also those who are situationally vulnerable and have so far been sidelined.This would mean that central and local governments will need to accurately assess and identy which consumers remain vulnerable so that they can also be given access to appropriate support such as priority supermarket delivery slots or local food provision through other means.:Edinburgh womanwho has battled cervical cancer and brain tumours fronts new UK-wide Cancer Research fundraising appealSue Davies, head of consumer protection and food policy at Which  said:ldquoIt is a real concern that months into lockdown, the current system of food provision is still not working for so many of those who need it the most. Some people could now be looking at a clf edge where shielding restrictions are lted and they are left to fend for themselves, cut off from outside help in getting essential groceries.ldquoWhich  is now calling for the UKrsquos four governments to work with the food industry, local authorities and charities to ensure a longer-term plan for supporting all of those who are at risk and need support is in place by the end of July, so that no vulnerable person faces dficulties in accessing the basic food supplies they need.Commenting on research by Which  showing vulnerable people in Scotland are struggling to access food supplies, Scottish Labour MSP Elaine Smith said: ldquoThese concerning findings raise serious questions about both the UK and Scottish Governmentrsquos handling of the emergency response to the pandemic. Now more than ever, we have a duty to protect the most vulnerable people in our society, and it is clear that many in this category have been failed.ldquoThis has exacerbated the longstanding and growing issue of food poverty in Scotland. Last week I launched a consultation on my parliamentary bill to enshrine the right to food in Scots Law, and the current public health crisis has underlined the need to take action.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoWe recognise that the impacts of coronavirushave meant that many iniduals, including those at increased risk of severe illness, face increased food insecurity.ldquoTo support iniduals to access the food and other essentials they need, we established a national helpline and have provided pound million of funding for local authorities to extend support for those at risk until the end of September. This is in addition to the pound million allocated in April and pound. million allocated to extend Free School Meal provision over the summer holidays.ldquoWe have committed to continue to provide funded grocery packages for those who need them until the end of July, in line with shielding advice, and have awarded around pound. million to support third sector activity on food, including up to pound. million for FareShare."},{"url":null,"title":"78-back-extending-putins-rule-russian-constitutional-change","story":"In the week-long balloting that concluded on Wednesday, .% voted for the changes and .% voted against, with all precincts counted by Thursday morning, Russiarsquos Central Election Commission said.The turnout exceeded %, according to officials, with the reported numbers reflecting the highest level of voter support for Mr Putin in  years.:Russians vote on changes for Putin to stay in power until In the  presidential election, .% of voters supported his candidacy, while in the  election only .% did.But Kremlin critics say the numbers are , with an unrealistic approval rating for the Russian leader amid widespread frustration over declining living standards.ldquoA record in falsying votes has been set in Russia, opposition politician Alexei Navalny said in a Facebook post. ldquoThe announced result has nothing whatsoever to do with the peoplersquos opinion.The presidentrsquos approval rating was at % in May, according to the Levada Centre, Russiarsquos top independent pollster.

It has taken some time to reach this decision.#But as we all start to interact more, it’s vital that we take all reasonable steps to reduce risk and we know that face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission indoors.#Also in shops, as on public transport, contact tracing is more dficult because we usually don’t know the people that we have been contact with. So a face covering provides an additional layer of protection. It is therefore for all of these reasons, that face coverings in shops will be compulsory from the end of next week.#But please do not wait until then — get into the habit now. This is an important way for all of us to help protect each other and to display that sense of solidarity that has helped the country so well over these past months.#From Friday, July , Children who are  years old or under will now be able to play normally with friends outdoors.Distancing should still be adhered to by children while indoors and there is no change to the guidelines for adults.Other rules will remain the same — you should continue to meet in groups of eight or less, and to meet no more than two other households at a time.For young people aged  to , the limit on the number of meetings you can have in any one day has been lted, meaning that dferent groups of friends can meet at dferent times of the day.However, meetings should still take place outdoors and should be no more than eight people — from no more than three households — at any one time.Ms Sturgeon also announced that the two-metre distancing requirement will be relaxed for some key sectors — with the appropriate mitigations in place.The government will work with those in the hospitality, retail and public transport sectors initially to agree the mitigations that will be required, which will allow sectors to operate a one-metre distance ruling.It is hoped that these exemptions for specic sectors could be agreed and in place by the time phase three comes round, potentially from Thursday, July .Mitigations could be improved ventilation, perspex screens, regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk.However, Ms Sturgeon recognised that the guidance will be change between sectors.The First Minister said: #In my view, this represents a balanced and proportionate approach to what is a genuinely dficult issue. It allows businesses to cater for more customers — and we know that for some that will be the dference between staying in business or closing.#However, it also continues to minimise risk — which, for some iniduals, and with no exaggeration, could be the dference between le and death.#Obviously,infection levels were to rise again, we reserve the right to re-impose a strict two-metre rule, either nationally or locally, and to take other public health measures that are necessary to keep us safe.#Conversely, though,we continue to make progress, we may be able to consider a more general relaxation in later phases.#Outdoor hospitality, such as pavement cafes and beer gardens, can re-open from Monday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed, and although tourism will not open fully until July , self-contained holiday accommodation — for example holiday cottages, lodges or caravans with no shared facilities — can reopen from tomorrow.An additional five positive cases were confirmed yesterday, taking the total now to , in Scotland.One COVID- death was registered in Scotland in the past  hours, taking the total number of deaths, of people who have tested positive for COVID-, to ,.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This comes as the prevalence of the condition in the county was predicted to double between  and .Anna Buchanan, of the Le Changes Trust – a charity that invests in and supports three groups, including people living with dementia and their unpaid carers # described the strategy document as an “exemplar for where” and has told members they would be contributing up to £, to support an independent the evaluation of the impact of the strategy.The meeting of the Integration Joint Board , last Wednesday, saw board members agree that the strategy document was a “formidable piece of work” and vital at a time when almost all families in Orkney will be touched by dementia in some respect.Presenting the strategy, Gillian Coghill, NHS Orkney Alzheimer Scotland Clinical Nurse Specialist, outlined the work undertaken and their aspirations for the future. She said: “The purpose of the Orkney Dementia Strategy - is to set out a renewed vision for dementia care and support in Orkney. It draws on a wide range of evidence and inter-related policies, including Scotland’s Third National Dementia Strategy. Most importantly of all, it draws on the experiences and views of people living in Orkney whose lives are affected by dementia. Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The GREAT Inspirations campaign will recognise companies that have gone above and beyond to continue to operate for their employees, serve their customers and contribute to their local communities. Here are some examples of the many thousands of companies that have proved to be an inspiration.Rooms and pamper packages for NHS workers away from their families, prepping more than  meals a week for vulnerable people in the community and projecting light shows every week for Clap for Carers are just some of the things one hotel team has done during the coronavirus outbreak.The team at the Queens Hotel in Southsea have been working hard since lockdown began in March to support everyone in the community across Portsmouth.Duty manager Megan Lockyer has been working with the small team who have welcomed more than  NHS workers to the hotel, which during the Second World War served as a hospital for recovering servicemen, for a place to rest away from their jobs.She said: “I watched the NHS workers come back to the hotel after a challenging day and I really wanted to let them know how much we appreciate what they are doing.“I came up with the idea of making hampers for the NHS workers who are currently with us at the hotel.“I shared my idea with the Facebook group and it was amazing how the community responded.“The NHS staff had told us how sore their hands were due to constant washing and we were able to include aloe vera hand cream along with items such as face masks, relaxing bath gels, slippers and Easter eggs.”Staff also worked with Medusa Hairdressing in Southsea to create more hampers which were distributed to key workers in local nursing homes.The hotel’s managing director Farid Yeganeh said: “I am delighted with the small team we have working at the hotel who have ensured it is clean and safe for our NHS guests.” vw, px\"  More than , meals have been sent out in lockdown to vulnerable people around the city thanks to a collaboration between the hotel, a collective of voluntary organisations called Portsmouth Hive, Portsmouth City Council, NHS Portsmouth CCG, the charity arm of Portsmouth Football Club called Pompey in the Community, as well as Anghel Niko Nedelcu, head chef from Portsmouth’s Brasserie Blanc and Royal Beach Hotel head chef Paul Playford. The initiative received two £, anonymous donations, as well as food donations from local businesses including butchers Buckwells. Farid said: “We got an email from the council at the start of lockdown about whether any businesses had any stock that was going out of date. It just snowballed from there really and we teamed up with the Hive to get meals distributed and it means so much that we could help our community.”Each week for Clap For Carers, projections showing support for the NHS were displayed on the Edwardian era hotel as part of the team’s commitment to supporting local health workers. Farid added: “I have always been aware that we have a really special team working at the hotel and this just underlines it. I look forward to being able to welcome back the whole Queens Hotel team once the lockdown is over.”When coronavirus started appearing in Inverness, care home manager Victoria Connolly was determined no one who worked or lived there would fall ill.So she asked the staff of the Isobel Fraser home in Invernessthey’d be prepared to live onsite and was thrilled when  said they would.But then came the problem of where to put them.The -year-old said: “There are a couple of rooms upstairs I could fit six people into. But then I thought, ‘Where am I going to put everyone  ’”“I have a friend with a campervan so I phoned her and askedwe could use it. She agreed but I needed more so she suggested I hire one.”Victoria got in touch with Highland Auto Campers whose owner Mark Jarratt, , immediately agreed to hire her three vehicles for cost.While they’d normally charge £ a night for their practically-new fleet, the care home got them for just £ each a week.Mark says: “We’ve only been going two years but earlier this year, things were going well – March was picking up and April and May were fully booked.“But we only get an eight-month window to make our money because of the tourist season so lockdown came at the worst time for us, the start of our season and was a complete disaster.“Then around April , we got a call from the Isobel Fraser home. Stories were, by then, beginning to emerge that some care homes had been really badly hit by coronavirus.“They said that while the home was free of coronavirus, they knew they needed to take steps to keep both staff and residents virus free and by providing accommodation for their staff on site.hey wanted to rent three of our vans to do this.“We were surprised to get the phone call – there are a lot of similar companies in the area – but quite pleased and we immediately agreed to assist in any way that we could. We just wanted to help.“It was also a win-win situation for us. The campervans hadn’t been used for a few weeks, they were just sitting quarantined and this was income – not a great deal of income but better than nothing.“Even though they hadn’t been used for weeks, and one was so new it had never been used, we gave them a thorough clean before driving them over and setting them up.“The staff and some of the residents were quite excited when we arrived and were looking out of the windows.”Six care home staff slept in the vans for between three and five weeks. Manager Victoria said: “They really enjoyed it – they were warm and comfortable. Most have said they’d take them out on holiday!”The care home, which has  residents, hasn’t had a single case of coronavirus. Mark said: “We were really proud to have been able to help. It’s good to do something for the community.”Newtownards-based company Shnuggle ersied into making PPE when the coronavirus pandemic hit the firm’s core business.Sinead and Adam Murphy were building the company into a leading name among parents with products such as an air bedside crib, air flow mattress, rocking stand, toddler baths, bath stands and many other creations.But the growth was interrupted when Covid- arrived in the UK, and the country went into lockdown.Although UK sales remained strong, imports were hit and Shnuggle’s owners turned their attention to designing and creating a face covering that would help save lives.Adam and Sinead quickly realised that they could help make a dference in the national effort to provide Personal Protective Equipment items. After taking measures needed to sustain the business, including taking advantage of UK Government furlough and business loan schemes, they set about creating and growing not-for-profit business Hero Shield.Adam said: “We had seen a few initiatives that had popped up all around the world.“A lot were printing D face shields so we kind of sat down with our head of design who was on furlough and said, ‘can we come up with a design here that we could start producing at rock bottom price and we’d prefer it to be a reusable one rather than a disposable one ’.“We came up with designs over the course of a weekend, by Monday we had done  dferent designs and D printed them on our prototyping printer and we’d put out a call on LinkedIn to local companies who wanted to get involved and within a very short space of time we had about  dferent businesses all saying, ‘Yep, we can do that bit and we’ll do it free of charge or we’ll do it at cost’.“We said that we weren’t doing it to make money. We were trying to help the NHS and other care workers so we founded another company which was Hero Shield Ltd and we set it up as not for profit so nobody could take any money out of it. Alongside that we did a crowdfunder to cover the costs so we raised £, in the end.“We managed to produce and ship out about , face shields in about six weeks.”Adam and Sinead are working to secure charitable status for Hero Shield Ltd, which is still running on a non-profit basis, and is now focussing more on charities and care services that don’t have the funds for whatever PPE they might need to get back up and running.Sinead said: “The businesses that were actually producing the face shields, we passed the orders to them and they have turned it into more of a commercial venture because we got a massive order from the NHS.“It was worth shy of £m and we needed to focus back on Shnuggles, so we passed it over to them and they pay a royalty into the Hero Shield charity for every one that they make.”So having helped the NHS in Northern Ireland, Adam and Sinead are now focused again on their core business – creating and marketing clever products for babies and children.Read about more inspiring GREAT stories at greatbritaincampaign inspirationscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From helping to build Nightingale Hospitals to delivering essential supplies to those who are shielding, they have helped thousands of people across the country. We take a look at how one such veteran is helping out.This is not the first time former soldier Joshua Ryder has seen a pandemic close up, having volunteered to visit Sierra Leone during the West African Ebola virus outbreak. The -year-old worked in what was known as a “red zone” in Kerry Town,  miles from capital Freetown.As a member of Royal Army Medical Core, he worked as a combat medical technician, receiving awards for Top Trainee and Adult Learner of the Year.Joshua said: “We treated patients with confirmed or suspected Ebola. The symptoms are similar to those of malaria and gastroenteritis. “We triaged and tested patients to determine whether they had these or Ebola.”The West African outbreak began in , ending in Sierra Leone in .Two-and-a-half years after the first case was discovered, the outbreak resulted in more than , cases with , deaths. vw, px\"  Such was the volatility of the strain – most widespread outbreak of the disease in history – Joshua was only allowed to work in the area for  days.He said: “I loved the country. It has some beautul sights and the people are really friendly. “It was sad to see the devastation caused by the pandemic. We didn’t only focus on the pandemic. We visited orphanages and helped build something for the country.“It was moving to see the children who lost their parents to the virus.”During the coronavirus outbreak he is again working, but the environment could not be more dferent.Having left the army in , he is now a trainee nursing associate on a Midlands Partnership NHS Trust acute mental health ward in Stafford.Joshua, who is father to Tia, aged , and her -year-old sister Lola, said: “Day to day I am more involved with the physical well-being of the patients – calming them, making physical observations, doing ECGs and bloods. “I go to Keele University one day a week and am due to start my second year in September.”It was Joshua’s experiences and expertise in the army that led him to the NHS in general, and mental health in particular.He said: “I have worked in demanding conditions in ious locations around the world. I am adaptable to suit many environments and job roles.” vw, px\"  In the military he saw firsthand soldiers suffering poor mental health. One of his friends, also serving in the army, committed suicide.He said: “I entered the NHS through the Step into Health programme, which has been brilliant.“I have been able to prove myself and have had really positive feedback.“I won an award for Outstanding Impact Since Joining the NHS at the programme’s first ceremony.”Joshua is helping to treat patients through more dficult times than usual.“We are doing absolutely brilliantly,” he said. “It would be abnormal, with all the constant changes,we did not experience stress and anxiety.“We have adapted and made changes.“Here our patients have been brilliant.“We have got a good team here, a good mix of people with dferent skills. We all support each other and do everything we can for our patients.”Joshua has also been a volunteer with men’s mental health charity Men Unite, supporting males in crisis.He ran a half marathon last year to raise £ for Mental Health UK.“And this month I am running  miles, having so far raised £ for the same charity through JustGiving.” he said.Former service personnel have helped dferent communities deal with all manner of problems, making urgent deliveries of food and medicines to vulnerable people while also helping those who are shielding receive what they need.Many others have helped ensure those who need a test for the virus have been able to get one by setting up mobile testing sites, allowing them to run smoothly and safely to daily test thousands of people with symptoms.A lot of this work has required specic skills our veterans have learnt throughout years of military service.The work of these veterans goes to show the military gives you key skills, transferable to civilian le – be it healthcare, business or organisation.Veterans form an important part of our NHS workforce and, throughout COVID-, many more have come forward to support the continued fight against this pandemic.Working across a iety of roles, both on and off the frontline, the NHS has benefitted from their military expertise and experiences, invaluable at this challenging time.From redesigning hospital departments to safely supporting virus and non-virus patients, to providing care for those in Nightingale Hospitals and supporting nurses using military mental health resilience techniques, vets have once again served our country with pride.This is in addition to many who have continued to work in dedicated NHS services for ex-service personnel, such as Veterans’ Mental Health Transition, Intervention and Liaison Service and Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service to ensure care and treatment remains available throughout this period, virtually or via phone. vw, px\"  Minister for Defence People and Veterans Johnny Mercer, pictured right, said: “Those who’ve served in the armed forces have developed a vast array of skills during their career, meaning they can play a huge part now in our national effort to tackle coronavirus. “We have seen many veterans making a fantastic contribution during the pandemic, through helping out the vulnerable in their local communities, to running mobile testing sites nationally. We cannot thank them enough for their efforts.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is also hoped to help Shetland#s existing oil and gas industry achieve carbon net zero targets.Plans for the hub are still in early stages with no specic projects agreed. However, ideas such as an offshore wind farm east of Shetland, and the creation of hydrogen from natural gas or electrolysis, are some of the ideas being suggested.Smaller scale community projects would also be developed through the hub project.Mr Irvine#s report to the council said the hub could generate pound billion of revenue for the region, remove carbon emissions by eight million tons, and create , jobs.He said the formative phase would look at which options are viable commercially and which were not.While the council has already committed pound, to the project, Mr Irvine said funding from the Scottish and UK governments as well as the Highlands and Islands Enterprise would be needed.He also said private sector investment was ldquocore to the project ndash and a steering group was working on that.Lerwick North councillor Stephen Leask had questioned how strong the council#s position # and how much financial risk it could face.Mr Irvine said most of the risk would be taken by the major investors from the energy industry, rather than the SIC.Martyn Tulloch, who leads the Net Zero Solution Centre, at OGTC, told the meeting that while other regions were advancing hub projects, with one in Humberside said to be the furthest advanced, he was not aware of any that had received Scottish government funding.#We have been approached by other regions but this is very much our sole focus at the moment,# he added.SIC leader Steven Coutts said the hub was a #crucial# project to Shetland#s future # and one that the council could not progress alone.He added it would need to bring #signicant community benefits# .#We want to see people thrive in Shetland with a strong and resilient community,# he added.Councillors agreed to progress the project into its #formative phase#, which will see the project team work with the energy industry and government agencies to identy next steps, including research projects and trials.Consultations will also take place with the community, businesses and other relevant interestsA funding application is expected to be submitted to the Scottish government next month...Police are appealing for the publicrsquos help to trace a man missing from his home in Lerwick since the early hours of Thursday nd July#.People will soon have to wear masks when visiting the shops in Shetland, the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced today.

This time round she doubled that.A few days later and this time a quintet of girls flew in formation round the course again this time competing for the Lochalsh Ladies Stableford prize.Sandi Beatson, fresh from victory in the first competition of the season, registered her second straight win but on this occasion only by the very narrowest of margins # the dreaded #better inward half# which is a count-back method used to declare a result when scores are tied after  holes.The player with the better score for holes - is then declared to be the winner.Apparently, the weather conditions were favourable so it#s dficult to see why the recorded #numbers# were so comparatively poor against the par of the course.New club member Shona Jackson very nearly started off her campaign with victory but I#m sure that even after one bf she#ll be able to settle in and join our girls in chat, combat and competitions.By my calculations Sandi#s two loops were +pts whereas Shona#s were +pts and that my friends was how the result was decided.With the threat of the coronavirus still hanging over us the committee decided at short notice to add a Skye Community Response fundraising competition to the club fixture list to be played over a period of two days with all the entry fees being donated to that worthy local cause.Players both male and female could submit as many rounds as they liked in the two day period and despite the rather fy weather several took the opportunity to sharpen their respective games and submit more than one ##.Playing on day one Robbie Macaskill and Chris Hanley # the latter proudly brandishing a new set of sticks # ed the day#s best scores of pts in the Stableford format with the former easing the latter courtesy of the better inward half.Despite a rocky , prelude to his round Robert settled well toloop scores of  and .Chris was on fire on the first nine with a fine  but the old fella must have been eating too many chocolate bars during lockdown and faded to  #coming home#.Donnie Macphee took third place one point in arrears.Some of the boys ed next day for another bf and another contribution to the charitable cause of choice but it was Hamish Philp, who had apparently been #shooting the lights out# in the winter league, who ed the best score of the occasion # a blistering pts.Had the competition been an official #counter# for handicap purposes Hamish would have graciously received a reduction of a couple of shots from his current mark but the omens for his season look promising.A distant speck in the rear view mirror was Ryan Macaskill on pts with John Maclean weighing into bronze position courtesy of pts for his honest endeavour on the day.However, pause for drum roll.The award for #the moment# must go to Club Captain Kenny Macleod who bodaciously eagled the par  th hole # all yds of it # and into the prevailing wind too!One wonders how many stones or sprinkler heads the old boy#s ba# must have bounced off to propel him to the distant target in three miserly shots.This is not aggrandisement # it was a truly remarkable effort by the bodach!The most prestigious competition in the gents fixture list # the Club Championship # is coming soon and there should be better than average competition this time round in pursuit of the title won by Ryan Macaskill in .One can#t help noticing that the assimilation of the three young lads into the fold last year caused some of the higher single-figure handicappers to emerge from their possible casual slumber of complacency and do something to improve both their game and their handicaps to ward off the challenge from these youngsters.It worked and not just to the benefit of the players themselves but to the general enhancement of the playing calibre of the gents section of the golf club.Two qualying rounds will be played to determine the four successful candidates eligible to compete in knockout matchplay semi-finals in their quest to be crowned Club Champion and subsequently have their name added to the Roll of Honour in the clubhouse #it#s doors ever swing open again Emerging from this prolonged and enforced period of omphaloskepsis and procrastibaking one can confidently predict a healthy turnout of golfing gladiators irrespective of the weather!CSS or Competition Scratch Score is a reflection of the playing dficulty of the course based on the scores ed with the handicaps represented on any particular day.Stableford format awards points as follows. Eagle, two under parpts: birdie, one under parpts, parpts and bogey, one over parpt.This form of play is very popular as a very high score on one or two holes doesn#t ruin the player#s chances of winning as would be the case in medal or strokeplay competition.Generally speaking the better players prefer the former while the rest of us favour the latter!Par is the score expected to be recorded on the hole by a #scratch# player and is determined by the number of shots the player should take to reach the green then add on two for putts.A par can be three # one shot plus two putts four # two shots plus two putts or five # three shots plus two putts. .

DaoineThe study of areas like Staffin, Tiree and the Western Isles has been labelled as the most comprehensive social survey on the state of Gaelic communities ever conducted.The findings conclude that the language is in crisis, and that within remaining vernacular communities of Scotland the social use and transmission of Gaelic is at the point of collapse.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands Language Sciences Institute and Soillse, a multi-institutional research collaboration which includes Sabhal Mòr Ostaig in Skye, outline the findings in a new book published todayThe authors of ‘The Gaelic Crisis in the Vernacular Community: A comprehensive sociolinguistic survey of Scottish Gaelic’ urge a radical new agenda and strategy for Gaelic revitalisation in the islands.They argue for the creation of a community development trust for Gaelic-speakers that is island based and under the direct control of the community.Professor Conchúr Ó Giollagáin, Professor of Gaelic Research at the University of the Highlands explained the motivation behind the new book.He said: “It is important that we are clear about the immense scale of the challenges involved in reversing the ongoing decline in the use of Gaelic in these areas.“Our statistical evidence indicates that the Gaelic vernacular community is comprised of around , people, of which a majority are in the  years and over age category.“The decline of the Gaelic community, as especially shown in the marginal practice of Gaelic in families and among teenagers, indicates that without a community-wide revival of Gaelic, the trend towards the loss of vernacular Gaelic will continue.“We found a mismatch between current Gaelic policies and the level of crisis among the speaker group which must be addressed to face the urgency of the language loss in the islands.“The primary focus of Gaelic policy should now be on relevant initiatives to avert the loss of vernacular Gaelic.”In order to make Gaelic policy viable, the researchers called for a re-aligning of national policy to address the decline in the use of Gaelic as a community language.Whilst some elements of national policy have had some success, such as the numbers of primary pupils in Gaelic Medium Education, without an overarching revitalisation approach, as outlined in their research, the authors believe the decline in the Gaelic vernacular community will rapidly continue.Iain Caimbeul, research fellow at the Language Sciences Institute in the University of the Highlands and Islands added: “If Scotland is to continue to give practical expression to its commitment to sustaining cultural ersity, it is vital that strategy for the Gaelic group is rooted in the broader context of community revitalisation.#We hope this research will be valuable to those interested in seeking to sht public policy assumptions from a sole dependence on the school system for creating the next generation of fluent Gaelic speakers.“It is vital that we change the basis for allocating resources to protect against further decline.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience

just a little bit further in pursuit of the truth # salivating in the best Pavlovian traditions.There will never be a time, certainly not in the foreseeable future, when there will be ‘spare’ money floating around Sandwick Road.The halcyon days of having underspent budgets and of looking for projects on which to lavish ‘leftover’ cashare but a twinkle in old Convenors’ eyes.So any refurbishment of the council chambers, shamefully overlooked by at least the last five incumbent collaboratives, was always going to be moderately controversial.It certainly didn’t require a Molotov cocktail lobbed in its general direction, especially not one fuelled by completely unsubstantiated innuendo and inferences, designed to ignite ‘public’ opinion.An uncaring, out-of-touch majority of elected membershad decided to refurbish the council chambers in the middle of the Covid- crisis, ignoring the more pressing needs of the local economy.The comfort of our bums on seats was of greater signicance than the struggles of inidual businesses trying to survive a devastating economic downturn.Balderdash.The decision to refurbish the council chambers was about much more and, in any scheme of things, needed doing.That Councillor Murray knew it and had commissioned a report to explain it to him, was neither here nor there.He went with his simple narrative and the howling began.The decision was actually taken some  months ago and, despite some robust discussion, it was agreed that what was planned was necessary and overdue.The seating in the chamber was, after  years of wear and tear, burst at the seams.Its tangerine hue had now assumed a week old, orange peel in the sun, frayed facade.It stank a bit and was, even to my own initial impressions three years ago, a bit of a tawdry embarrassment.Especially so when it doubles as a civic reception arena for visitors of every gravitas and distinction.They say thatyour IT infrastructure is five years old, then it’s probably  years out of date.When you cannot, in today’s modern world, reliably communicate with your ‘satellite’ offices in Castlebay, Balivanich and Tarbert, far less those at Marybank, Cromwell Street and Creed Park then the chances of joining in with anyone further afield may be remote.When, in a hugely changed modern meeting landscape, everything is getting done on Zoom or Microsoft Teams, then you need to be able to do so efficiently, effectively and with stability.Of course, nobody could have predicted this  months ago which is why, retrospectively, we should be ‘selling’ the notion to the public as the excellent news it is. other offices will be upgraded to the same standard of communication technology.Nobody will have to rely, embarrassingly, on a decent mobile signal and having to ‘put you on speakerphone’ to continue a discussion when the smoke signals have failed.Sensible people understand this.People from Gordon’s own party understand this.The ones who inhabit the real world anyway and some have already commented.The fact that an improved connectivity infrastructure might just re-invigorate our democracy hasn’t been lost on the more astute.Going back to ‘how we’ve always done things’ should never be an option again, given this new, exciting opportunity.Of course, there’s much that can be achieved by face-to-face contact and the physical intimacy of ‘actual’ meetings are still important.But that landscape will be vastly altered by the new normal.Hopefully, this will mean that a whole raft of possibilities might open up.The current format for being a councillor makes it dficult for many people to commit to even considering the election process, far less the minimum time required to attend all the meetings.Maybe being able to do so from the comfort of their own homes, raising their ‘virtual hands’ on a large screen in the chambers when they wish to speak, might just persuade more people that it’s time for our elderly, male-dominated, ‘democracy’ to change Which might just make for an influx of fresh thinking and constructive debate.Opposition for opposing’s sake is still the stuff of the primary school classroom.When you know you can propose the most fancul notions without any fear that they’ll ever get beyond the debating arena, you can always tell an incredulous audience that, but for the bad guys in the Comhairle, you could also have had ‘jelly and ice-cream’ in your ‘land of milk and honey’. local members know that successive national government failures have taken away most of the cows and bees, so why the continued deflection from reality by our local group on CNES Because they require to have a purpose, albeit a mostly destructive one.It has generally been accepted that our council workers, officers and directorates have done a pretty decent job in the midst of what have been exceptionally trying circumstances.But when you talk ‘council’ up here, you generally mean the whole kit-kaboodle.You throw everyone under the same bus when # in order to get a massive negative reaction for your own political ends # you allude that the Comhairle are spending a large sum of money on new chairs.Four months of exemplary work down the drain so someone can appear as some sort of martyr.Quite shameful behaviour, and quickly seen through by even his own acolytes, many of whom had spoken passionately in favour of a refurbishment , before adding their names to a list of dissenters when the motion was rejected as incompetent.Incompetent because the procurement processhad already begun, and had been explained, in great detail, several months previously.What has been hugely fortunate these past few months is the resilience which the Comhairle has been able to demonstrate as a result of having ‘balances’ at hand to deal with emergency situations such as Covid-.Balances which, had they embarked on a spree of imprudence as appealed for by the SNP group when budget setting was being undertaken, would have disappeared into the ether.Combine with their insistence on asking for meaningless, time-consuming report after report in an effort to undermine what’s already been decided and the wasted saved money could have us all bedecked in ermine.When you insist on portraying yourself as Roy Rogers in a white hat, consistently battling against the bad guysmaybe it’s time that you listened to Tonto.Hopefully, someone close will volunteer to be that side-kick, and soon, eh kemo-sabe Gordon is essentially a decent guy, but in his aspirations to undermine the credibility of his fellow councillors he undermines the hard work of every single council employee and misses his target spectacularly.The disconnect between the success of his party at national, and at local government level, may be partly down to perception.A degree of maturity, purposeful intent, willingness to participate and collaborate to be serious about their proposals, would go a long way.I like to think of myself as a reasonable fellow and, as I’ve previously stated, I will support any sensible suggestions, no matter their origin.Three years later, Gordon I’m still waiting.And it’s not due to any political or philosophical opposition.When it comes to golf, what you see is generally what you get.At Stornoway last week what we got was decent weather and decent scoring.In the Lewis Cup on Wednesday night, Stuart ‘Tyson’ Campbell triumphed

had told him how fortunate she felt to have had even such a short time with her beloved son.She said, #I have been so blessed. Noah was a beautul soul with a beautul mind#, said Fr McGinnity.He poured a whole letime of love into my le in  short years.Read MoreClaire McNeilly:Opinion Tears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralA bunch of flowers was fixed to the church railings, along with posters bearing the tragic teen#s picture and the words Rest in Peace Noah.Upon arrival, the hearse was escorted by a guard of honour led by members of his former basketball team, Belfast Phoenix, and by school friends wearing their St Malachy#s College unorms. Inside was a large framed photograph of Noah and his mother Fiona, showing both of them smiling, with the St Malachy#s school crest above it. A black and green ribbon - the colours of St Malachy#s - was tied to the handle of the white coffin. After Mass the cortege, which was en route to Roselawn cemetery, made a brief stop at the Antrim Road college, where Noah, described in the homily as someone who carried his potential so lightly and so humbly, was a Year  student.Pupils and teachers lined the avenue leading up the school to pay their respects.Outside, a large crowd had gathered making social distancing dficult.The gates of the school have become an impromptu shrine to its lost boy, with the iron work emblazoned with flowers, candles and messages of sympathy.Earlier, Fr McGinnity said Noah#s grieving friends and schoolmates were also in the family#s thoughts.Indeed, right now, students from Noah#s form class are attending a prayer service... together they will be remembering the joy and goodness that he brought into the lives of so many, the priest said. We remember the messages they sent to Noah#s family, and the many tributes they paid on social media and across the airwaves. Those messages and tributes have been a source of immense comfort.One of his close friends said on social media during the week, #Noah had so much potential in everything he did#.What endeared him to his friends was the fact that he carried that potential so lightly and so humbly. As a natural leader he wanted everyone to appreciate their own gts and talents. More than that, he wanted them to find the joy in living that he had found.Read More Noah Donohoe changed our world: Search hero#s tribute to Belfast teenNoah#s body was found in an underground storm drain in north Belfast six days after he failed toto his home in the Ormeau area in the south of the city. His disappearance sparked one of the most intensive searches for a missing person in Northern Ireland#s history. Police believe he might have suffered a head injury after falling off his bicycle and could have been disorientated when he entered the drain.The search for the popular schoolboy brought together hundreds of people from across the city and beyond, uniting the two main communities in a common purpose.Noah and his mother had a personal connection with the church, which was, Fr McGinnity said in his homily, their spiritual home.It was here, in this church that Fiona taught Noah as a child to thank God for his le and to remember that he, like every child, has been sent into the world to share God#s love with everyone, he said, adding that Noah was the kind of boy who was just full of the joy of living.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandClaire McNeillyOpinionTears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeralNoah Donohoe came back to north Belfast on Wednesday.

Another was found to have driven through a mph zone at mph and in once case, a driver was caught speeding through a mph area at mph.Mr Sherrard said: I actually find it very distressing to think that someone - anyone - would think it is acceptable to drive at mph on any road.There is no way that driver was in control of the car at that speed so the potential to kill some innocent person or themselves is obvious. He continued: Driving through a built up area with a speed limit of mph at almost mph is, in my opinion, the absolute height of irresponsibility.And I really hope that the person detected doing that speed felt the full rigours of the law.We have members in Le After who lost loved ones through road traffic collisions perhaps  or  years ago and they are still suffering, they are still missing their loved one every day just as we continue to miss my father every day.If you take someone#s le because of your driving, you have to live with the consequences of that for ever.I don#t believe anyone who gets into a car and drives over the speed limit intentionally sets out to kill anyone butthey do they are bringing that burden on their own shoulders too. I can#t imagine it is an easy thing to live with.While many speeding offences are at the lower end of the scale, Mr Sherrard said even a few miles per hour over the recommended limit could cause devastation.He added: It beggars belief that in spite of the very graphic road safety ads we see on our television screens depicting how even a few miles an hour over the speed limit can cause catastrophic damage, so many people think there is nothing wrong with speeding.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland#s speeding hotspots as offences surge in yearThe number of speeding offences in Northern Ireland has surged by % year-on-year.Most ReadMan who died in freak car accident was son of loyalist murder victimFoster asks O#Neill to resign during Storey funeral investigation, but vows not to collapse Executive Coronavirus strikes up to  people after family gathering in border villageTwo wrongs don#t make a right: DUP#s Foster urges loyalists to follow rules after surge in applications for Twelfth parades amid Storey funeral row Claire McNeillyOpinionTears and white roses, balloons and applause as community le halts for Noah Donohoe funeral,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

From this date passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations.

Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  googletag.cmd.push The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said:“As we move throughthe Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety ofpassengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. googletag.cmd.push “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued:“We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is alsoimportant that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.” Further information is available on nidirect at:https:www.nidirect.gov.uk  coronavirus-safer-travel- guidanceandhttps:www.nidirect.gov.uk  face-coverings  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Noella Hutton hit the big time in America in the s where she appeared on stage with the likes Stevie Nicks and Sheryl Crow. Her first album was critically acclaimed and she toured the States running shoulders with the A-list. But since ing to Derry in , Noella has sought out a much quieter pace of le and spends a lot of time working for animal welfare charity Friends of Rescue and with her mum Josie who now lives in Culmore Manor. googletag.cmd.push Just before lockdown, Noella released her eagerly anticipated second album Love and Liars.  Any plans for gigs and touring were immediately cancelled, so like many artists she turned to virtual gigs which she streamed through Facebook Live. Noella discovered this new style of performing suited her and set herself a target of raising enough money to buy a camper van to go on the road with her beloved dogs Dolly and Buba. I couldnt leave without them, she said. They are my comfort and my security soIm going anywhere I just have to take them. Theyre my wains. Ive had them since they were born. googletag.cmd.push  Dolly and Bubba join Noella for her virtual concerts and have become a firm fan favourite. They are more famous than me at this stage, laughed Noella. She has also been joined by her sister Jeanette Hutton for some of her performances and in one memorable gig she even visited Culmore Manor where she entertained the residents and duetted with her mum. My mammy is just the best, said Noella. “I go up and see her every day and we talk through the window orits a nice day I can take her outside. I cook for every day. I just love me ma. Noellas Facebook gigs were a hit with fans who tuned in from around the world to hear her songs and have a bit of craic. I feel a lot better sitting in my house and having a laugh with people who want to hear me rather than singing in a pub up the town where you are competing with the noise of a poker machine and people shouting over the top of you, she explained. The only people watching are ones that want to watch. I had to learn cover versions to play in the pubs and it just strips the soul clean out of it. The only reason I learnt to play the guitar was so I could write music. With a healthy balance in her virtual tip jar, Noella started looking for the right vehicle to take her and the wains on the road.While scrolling through Facebook at am, Noella stumbled across her dream vehicle which was up for sale in Belfast. All the campers I had seen were big stupid ugly things with no light and big toilets and showers that took up half the room. But this was perfect. It was all I needed so I messaged the guy and said listen, I want the van. It was only up for five minutes, so it was meant to be. Noella has christened her new van Dorothy and after changing the carpets shes ready to start touring Ireland. Paddy in Rathmor Tyres and Paddy from The Carpet Man sorted me out and now Im ready for the road , said Noella. Im going to live stream from wherever I am, whether its to  people or two people Ill talk about where I am so it will be like a documentary every week.” Shell also use her time on the road to write some new songs. I can feel the songs coming, said Noella. “Maybe  or  of them. I might not write anything for five or six years and then it all comes through.

Noella Hutton hit the big time in America in the s where she appeared on stage with the likes Stevie Nicks and Sheryl Crow. Her first album was critically acclaimed and she toured the States running shoulders with the A-list. But since ing to Derry in , Noella has sought out a much quieter pace of le and spends a lot of time working for animal welfare charity Friends of Rescue and with her mum Josie who now lives in Culmore Manor. googletag.cmd.push Just before lockdown, Noella released her eagerly anticipated second album Love and Liars.  Any plans for gigs and touring were immediately cancelled, so like many artists she turned to virtual gigs which she streamed through Facebook Live. Noella discovered this new style of performing suited her and set herself a target of raising enough money to buy a camper van to go on the road with her beloved dogs Dolly and Buba. I couldnt leave without them, she said. They are my comfort and my security soIm going anywhere I just have to take them. Theyre my wains. Ive had them since they were born. googletag.cmd.push  Dolly and Bubba join Noella for her virtual concerts and have become a firm fan favourite. They are more famous than me at this stage, laughed Noella. She has also been joined by her sister Jeanette Hutton for some of her performances and in one memorable gig she even visited Culmore Manor where she entertained the residents and duetted with her mum. My mammy is just the best, said Noella. “I go up and see her every day and we talk through the window orits a nice day I can take her outside. I cook for every day. I just love me ma. Noellas Facebook gigs were a hit with fans who tuned in from around the world to hear her songs and have a bit of craic. I feel a lot better sitting in my house and having a laugh with people who want to hear me rather than singing in a pub up the town where you are competing with the noise of a poker machine and people shouting over the top of you, she explained. The only people watching are ones that want to watch. I had to learn cover versions to play in the pubs and it just strips the soul clean out of it. The only reason I learnt to play the guitar was so I could write music. With a healthy balance in her virtual tip jar, Noella started looking for the right vehicle to take her and the wains on the road.While scrolling through Facebook at am, Noella stumbled across her dream vehicle which was up for sale in Belfast. All the campers I had seen were big stupid ugly things with no light and big toilets and showers that took up half the room. But this was perfect. It was all I needed so I messaged the guy and said listen, I want the van. It was only up for five minutes, so it was meant to be. Noella has christened her new van Dorothy and after changing the carpets shes ready to start touring Ireland. Paddy in Rathmor Tyres and Paddy from The Carpet Man sorted me out and now Im ready for the road , said Noella. Im going to live stream from wherever I am, whether its to  people or two people Ill talk about where I am so it will be like a documentary every week.” Shell also use her time on the road to write some new songs. I can feel the songs coming, said Noella. “Maybe  or  of them. I might not write anything for five or six years and then it all comes through.

Since the first official announcement of the post-graduate facility in  , a catalogue of failures has been allowed by the university and decision-makers within government. Impediments almost too numerous to list have acted to frustrate,not block, delivery of what is agreed is a much-needed facility. googletag.cmd.push The responsibility and willingness to bow to problems readily rather than resolve them lies at many doors, not least: politicians, internal university committees, government committees, health officials, Stormont officials, UU officials, other universities, and the Northern Ireland Civil Service. This year, the British Medical Association was even being blamed for not proceeding quickly enough in accrediting the new courses . Is there an underlying and more pernicious problem that has its roots in decision-making by UU that is seen to favour other places over Derry  Why are our public representatives facilitating this  Since its establishment in Coleraine by the Stormont government in the s, the university has been allowed, and encouraged, to run an unfettered and unchallenged agenda, whereby major development decided upon by university authorities, based in Belfast, has been centred on Coleraine, Jordanstown and, more recently, North Belfast. googletag.cmd.push The post-GFA era has seen little change and, effectively, Belfast and Stormont, acting as a city-state, exercise a veto on every major development in Derry or the North West. This is the continuation of an unfortunate and deliberate policy which we thought had been consigned to a troubled past. Derry has been patiently lobbying for proper and deserved university provision for the region for  years. It is the last remaining grievance of the Civil Rights era, and the failure to provide a modern university in the North West sustains the injustice practiced by the Unionist government, now long gone, of the time. For almost  years, Direct Rule and devolved governments at Stormont and UU have favoured other localised priorities and broken promises to Derry. In , under the Ilex One Plan, UU and government gave a commitment to have , full-time students at Magee by . The actual number – under , – didn’t change at all over the decade. Most recently, a commitment, endorsed by Dublin and Westminster, to have , students at Magee by  was made in January as part of ‘New Decade New Approach’. Just weeks later, Stormont handed a poundm off-the-books bailout to UU for its well over-budget North Belfast campus, while simultaneously putting a freeze on Derry development. The city and the region are either the collateral damage of flawed strategic planning or dismissive indference to any regional equality and provision. It has to be one or the other and when you dismiss a region, you dismiss the people who live there. Given the inequitable outcomes flowing from policy-making pursued by a university with government money for almost  years now, it would, in a normal society, merit a full public inquiry. Local representatives and most worryingly, nationalist politicians, who would have traditionally questioned the policy, are failing to alter what is undeniably UU’s ‘Belfast-first’ agenda - to the huge detriment of northwest Ireland which has still, by far, the lowest Higher Education provision on these islands. Derry University Group figures recently put the HE uptake in Derry at fty percent lower than the next lowest in Ireland. The medical school,and when it arrives, is barely a fig leaf to cover UU’s embarrassment, and Stormont’s shame, at how they have treated Derry. It will house just  students – and the capital costs will be financed not by the university, nor central government, nor Stormont, but by the city-region itself from its City Deal package. Despite having failed utterly, and consistently, in its responsibilities to this region, UU stands to become the biggest single beneficiary of the City Deal. Stormont will not, however, underwrite the on-going running costs of the new Derry facility, on the grounds that UU – having spent all its money, and much more besides, in Belfast - is now for all intents and purposes, insolvent. In recent years, following lobbying by the Derry University Group and others, the Dublin government has stated that it is prepared to help lead university development in Derry and northwest Ireland – a promise, indeed, that is reinforced in its new Programme for Government. It is time to make good on that promise. Representative democracy and investment cannot be the trickle-down preserve of just one geographical area or one demographic community. Such presents as unbalanced economic, educational, social and cultural polarisation. It is a poor and failed model for regeneration especially now, given the possible economic and social repercussions of Covid-. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, a constituent college of the National University, is ideally placed to develop and deliver a medical school in the North West, and can do so rapidly. RCSI currently runs two medical school campuses in Malaysia and another in Bahrain. A new cross-border facility in the North West, operated by RCSI and overseen by the Irish and British governments directly as part of the North-South institutions, would short circuit the bureaucratic and financial logjams at Stormont and UU. It would also provide a starting blueprint for a new, autonomous cross-border university for Derry and Donegal, which ultimately is the only viable solution to the HE crisis here. It is time to put the North West first and allow us to develop our higher education sector independently, away from the grip of centralised decision-makers.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Kelly, who has coached Derry to back to back Celtic Challenge titles and a Nicky Rackard Cup success, feels the main problem with the Ulster championship is the window of opportunity to get it played. In  and , the Ulster championship was played off in two groups. Derry were relegated in  when they conceded the relegation play-off to Down, after defeat to Antrim in the Ulster semi-final. It also followed a winless Division A league and Christy Ring campaign. googletag.cmd.push Donegal were promoted for winning the shield. Derry were the shield winners in , when the competition was played between the league and the Oakleafers successful Nicky Rackard winning campaign. The decision to shelve the Ulster championship completely was taken early in . Ulster official Oliver Galligan conveyed the message to the Antrim and Down teams at the Conor McGurk final. “The restructuring of the national competitions aims to provide a high number of games for Ulster counties at their own level while the apathy towards the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship in recent times has been obvious,” Ulster Secretary Brian McAvoy later told delegates at the Ulster convention at the time. googletag.cmd.push “Therefore, with a heavy heart, the Ulster Senior Hurling Championship has been discontinued for a three year period .” Kelly outlined four options available to the deployment of the Ulster senior hurling championship. The first one was to play it after the league and before the Christy Ring Cup and other tiered championships. Kelly pointed to the need for counties to vote on moving thechampionships back to allow time. The majority of the counties hail from Leinster and Connacht, who would have to restructure their club scene accordingly, to accommodate the Ulster counties. With the hurling league finishing before the football league and with dual players almost defunct, the Ulster championship would need to fit around the club window “That one is the best option,” Kelly points out about slotting the Ulster championship into mid-season. “Thats the gold star one. The next one would be to play it after the Christy Ring is played. We have tried that and it didnt work,” he added, referring to the  season. “Option C is to play it before the National League, which means the Conor McGurk Cup would become the Ulster championship. You could have the Liam Harvey Cup and the Conor McGurk Cup could become the shield of that competition. Thats not degrading it, it is just saying there is an option.” Kellys fourth option would be not to have the Ulster championship, with the current schedule providing enough games and there is no window to play it. “To me, they are the four options and I dont see anything ,” he concluded.

Despite not yet being built, the futuristic eco-house, which is called The Qube, has gone up for sale in the Prehen area of the Waterside with a price tag of pound,. The five-bedroom property called The Qube will be built on land beside the Everglades Hotel. It has been advertised as one of Northern Irelands only passive houses, which means it will use very little energy and leave a small ecological footprint. The three-story dwelling will also be a smart home and the lights, heating and blinds can all be operated from a tablet or smartphone. googletag.cmd.push  The , sq ft building will be locatedon a triangular piece of landat the junction of Prehen Road andHazelwood Avenue. This heavily-wooded area is home to a number of mature trees which arecovered by a Tree Preservation Order . Although work on the property is yet to begin, it has full planning permission. However, the journey to obtaining this was not a smooth one. In Northeern Ireland, local councils are responsible for most planning decisions. Each council has planning officers who make recommendations about planning applications. However, the Planning Committee, which is made up of councillors, has the option to reject these recommendations. googletag.cmd.push The planning application for The Qube first came before Derry City and Strabane District Councils Planning Committee last September. Council planners provided councillors with a detailed report which recommended that planning permission be refused for the building.  The meeting was also told that  letters of objection had been sent by local residents. Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace. Councillors agreed to defer the decision for a site visit, which took place on September  last year and which was attended by seven councillors. On September , the Planning Committee voted not toaccept the recommendation to refuse the planning application and agreed to reconsider itfurther information on the Tree Protection Order was provided. The council sent out additional notications to all neighbours, objectors and supporters ofthe scheme in January this year and  more letters were received, with six in objection to the application and  in support. The letters in support said the site was an eyesore and the owner of the proposed building would have a vested interest in maintaining it. On March  this year, the Planning Committee met again and was told council planners had not changed their position that planning permission should be refused. The Principal Planning Officer told elected members an Arboriculture Impact Assessment had been carried out which broadly agreed with the initial recommendation that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the proposed scheme would not have a detrimental impact on the Tree Preservation Ordersite. DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock, who attended the site visit, told the meeting she did not believe the protected trees would be affected by the proposed building. She proposed to overturn the decision of the planning officer and for approval to be granted subject to conditions provided by planners. The proposal was seconded by SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins and was passed after seven votes for, three against and three abstentions. On Friday, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council confirmed that that an application for the Prehen building came before the Planning Committee in September  with a recommendation to refuse as it would result in the loss of a valuable urban woodland green space and the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this dwelling would not have an adverse impact on existing trees. The recommendation was not accepted by elected members and the application came back before the committee on March of this year as a reconsidered application, following a visit to the site by elected members and the submission of further information, said the spokesperson. Whilst the officers presented an unaltered opinion to refuse, elected members voted to approved the application.” The sale of The Qube, which was designed by architect Gerard McPeake, is being handled by McGuinness Fleck Estate Agents   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The championship was put on hold for three seasons, at the start of the  season. Derry won back to back titles in  and , but have not contested a final since the the  final at Owenbeg. Goals from Ruairi Convery and Paddy McCloskey had Derry well in the hunt. Convery, who scored -, levelled the game before Daniel McKernans winner. Antrim have won the last  in succession, with Down not lting the title since . Armagh reached the final in  and , losing to the Saffrons, before the competition was paused for three years, given the new tiered All-Ireland structure which has saw Derry play at Nicky Rackard and Christy Ring level. googletag.cmd.push The  season was the final year of the experiment with the Ulster hurling championship.  The County Derry Post contacted Ulster GAA for clarication of the future of the competition andthere were any further developments. “No decision has yet been taken on this matter. Its a matter for CCCC and Coiste Bainisti and we dont have any detail as to when it will be discussed,” read a statement from Ulster GAA PRO Declan Woods. In a special feature this week, we get the thoughts from Derry, Antrim and Down on the Ulster championship and where it could fit into the calendar. googletag.cmd.push “A provincial championship is a provincial championship. I think there could be a window for it before the Christy Ring,” felt Derry senior manager John McEvoy. Kevin Kelly, a former Derry selector, is on the Ulster Hurling Development committee feels there are four options available, but the best option would be after the league. Antrim captain Conor McCann said the Saffrons would welcome it back, but there needed to be the reward of an automatic spot in the All-Ireland series for the winner. Down boss Ronan Sheehan hit out at the Ulster Council for not having a championship in place.“I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” he said.

The supermarket giant wants to build a new store in the Buncrana Road area of the city. The company first applied for planning permission for the proposed store on a vacant site at the junction of Buncrana Road and Springtown Roadin .  The Derry News has learned that planners at Derry City and Strabane District Council have recommended that planning permission be granted for the store. The final approval for the development now rests with councillors on the council’s planning committee. If the new supermarket gets the green light from local councillors, Lidl says it will close its current store at Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push However, the company would retain its current building for storage purposes. In its planning submissions, Lidl said that they wanted to build a new larger store in Derry because of the lack of expansion space at its present store. The proposed new store would have much more parking facilities. The entrance to the new store would be via the Springtown Road which would reduce the traffic pressure on the busy Buncrana Road. Traffic entering and leaving Lidl’s current store creates a frequent bottleneck on the Buncrana Road. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Marie Lindsay is to step down as principal of St Marys College. Among those to pay tribute to her work was a spokesperson for St Eugenes Cathedral. A parish spokesperson said Mrs Lindsay had a great impact on the lives of students and staff through her leadership in St Marys College. She has also directly advanced the mission of evangelisation of the Church here in the Diocese of Derry. As an educator and leader, Marie has made an exceptional contribution to Catholic education here in the City and beyond. Marie, on behalf of everyone in the St Eugenes Parish we wish you very well in your retirement, the spokesperson added. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Lindsay joined St Marys in  and taught science for  years before being appointed principal in . During her time as principal, St Marys were involved in the first formal Shared Education Programme with Lisneal College. In , the school was awarded Specialist Status in Science and continues to promote STEM subjects and career paths. In , Mrs Lindsay was named Principal of the Year at the Foyle Blackboard Awards and in April  she was inducted into the Business Excellence Hall of Fame. Derrys Mayor Brian Tierney said Mrs Lindsay had done so much for education within the city. googletag.cmd.push Its with great pleasure that I offer my congratulations to Marie on her retirement, and with great admiration that I look back on everything that she has achieved both as teacher and, later, as a principal at St Marys College. Marie perfectly captured everything that teaching is about as she went above and beyond every day to put the needs of her students first. She was incredibly active within the community, including on our Council Education and Skills working group, to ensure that those not just within her own school, but across the district also,were receiving the best education they could. With two of her daughters recently welcoming a set of twins each Im sure she will certainly be kept very busy, and I look forward to welcoming Marie, her husband Collie and her family to the Mayors Parlour to celebrate her career when the guidelines allow it. I wish Marie a healthy and happy retirement, and offer my sincere thanks to her for everything she has done for theeducation sectorin our district.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

The call comes as bars and restaurants who can provide food on site prepare to open from tomorrow. Among the bars who have grouped together is The Dugout Bar in Maghera, and manager Una McReynolds says those making the rules are out of touch with reality. “The reason we can’t open is because we’ve been told we’re too dangerous,” she told Derry Now. “I would say % of the people making these decisions have never been in a local pub. They’re seeing what goes on in the Cathedral Quarter on a busy Saturday night, but that’s not real le. googletag.cmd.push “If we get four people through the door on a weekday, it’s like Christmas to us, we think it’s great. Even at weekends, we probably still wouldn’t be shoulder to shoulder. “Our customers can’t understand why we aren’t open. People don’t read into the specics of it, so everybody just thinks that all the bars can open tomorrow.” The online petition was launched by the owner of McKenna’s Bar in Armagh and has found support in many quarters, with pubs in Newry and Ballymena voicing support along with The Dugout. With the bigger establishments in a position to open their doors, Una feels the regulations show the inequality and discrimination at play. googletag.cmd.push “Hospitality is hospitality. It’s like saying the barbers can open but the hairdressers can’t, because women sit in the hairdressers longer than a man sits in the barbers,” she said. “We’re completely left alone. There is discrimination and inequality. Local pubs are never going to be able to survivethis continues. “All the big establishments are now allowed m social distancing, we’re not even allowed m. We can’t open our doors at all. “Who’s going to fight for us  I sent a message to a junior minster last week, but he couldn’t answer any of my questions. All he could say was ‘scientic evidence’. “Well, show us the scientic evidence that says sitting at a table, eating a burger and having a glass of wine is okay, but sitting at the same table just drinking a glass of wine is not.” The pressure has been exacerbated by dferences between the ious jurisdictions, and the recent political crisis sparked by Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neills presence at the funeral of veteran republican, Bobby Storey. “Now Sky TV are pushing the small bars to give them an update by July , when they’re going to reinstate charges,” said Una. “They just see that in the UK, the bars are open again. England are open on Saturday, Scotland have a date, the south have a date and the north of Ireland have nothing. “We now are in the situation where those in power have decided to throw their toys out of the pram over the weekend. “We’re in the middle of a pandemic, everyone waits to hear about a date and now they won’t even give press briefings. “Small pubs are the hub of the community. Some people would love to go out and have a pint, but they can’t afford to have a meal with their pint. “We have no one to turn to, because no one is responding. We’ve been left high and dry, nobody is making a decision for us and we are extremely frustrated.” The petition can be viewed here.

In an anonymous poll conducted by the County Derry Post, with  responses,  of John McEvoys squad indicated they would play for Team Ulster, yet only eight of the squad would see it as a benefit to hurling in the county. As part of the survey comments were sought. One said it was a good idea but it wouldnt be easily organised. All the rest spoke out against it, citing a range of reasons. googletag.cmd.push The combined Ulster team wouldnt compete with Top  teams for the McCarthy Cup, hence it would be a waste of time and resources should be used to get the Ulster championship resurrected. Another respondent pointed to Derrys ability to compete in the Joe McDonagh Cupall the best players in Derry were playing. With more publicity, the current tiered structure was the better solution. Team Ulster would paper over the cracks was another comment, with the already considerable training load also offered as a reason to oppose the concept. On the topic of bringing back the Ulster senior hurling championship,  players indicated it should be ed after its three-year absence. googletag.cmd.push One respondent, who commented at , felt Team Ulster was nice to chat about but would only serve players who felt they needed to be playing in the Liam McCarthy Cup. Full commitment to the Derry jersey, from all the best players, full backing from the county board and supporters, was the way forward, something he felt was happening. Of the squad,  felt it should be played after the league and before the tiered hurling championships, such as the Christy Ring and Joe McDonagh Cups. The remainder opted for a window in pre-season, before the leagues. One respondent felt that Antrim would be so far away from the rest of the pack, but a combined rest of Ulster team playing the Saffrons would diminish the competition.

culturersquo in Comber have been unveiled.A meeting to discuss the way forward was held in the town on Monday morning, with Ards and North Down Council officials joined by Chamber of Commerce representatives and local councillor Deborah Girvan.Work has been ongoing to develop a strategy on the way forward for Comber as coronavirus lockdown measures continue to ease, with more and more businesses reopening after being closed for four months.News of Mondayrsquos meeting comes ahead of the reopening of the hugely popular Comber Farmersrsquo Market tomorrow which also coincides with its sixth anniversary.A special cake will be cut by council chairman Trevor Cummings who will be joined by Northern Ireland Officer Minister of State Robin Walker.The market has been closed for the past three months as a result of Covid- with its reopening viewed as a boost for existing traders who will benefit from the increased footfall.Alderman Girvan mdash who arranged Mondayrsquos meeting in conjunction with Comber Chamber of Commerce mdash said cafes, restaurants and pubs have been among the hardest hit industries during the coronavirus pandemic.And with the hospitality businesses able to open their doors to the public this Friday, she thought that it would be beneficial to meet with the council to see what support it give to catering businesses to allow food to be served outdoors on pavements.ldquoEven though the two-metre social distancing rule will be halved, it will still be dficult for hospitality businesses to increase their capacity unless they expand outdoors, said Mrs Girvan.ldquoComber is the perfect place to introduce a cafeacute culture as there are wide footpaths on three sides of the town square and,permission for this is granted, it will create a kaleidoscope of colourful tables, chairs and umbrella shades.Mrs Girvan hopes that it will also attract more shoppers, cyclists and visitors to Comber as it slowly emerges out of lockdown.She also recognises that before anything happens, there are many issues to consider and for consultation with residents and businesses, describing Mondayrsquos meeting as a ldquofirst step to explore the opportunities and possibilities of reconfiguring footpaths to ensure the safety of visitors, shoppers, and cyclists.News of the cafe culture plan comes just days after the local council agreed to help hospitality businesses back on their feet by waiving the pound fee for a so-called pavement cafeacute licence fee, initially for nine months.Comber Chamber of Commerce chairwoman Laura Bradley, who is also director of the Indie Fude delicatessen, described the past few as ldquoextremely dficult for retailers across Northern Ireland.She said apart from shops that are selling food and drink, the majority of businesses in Comber have been closed for almost four months.ldquoComber has been branded the lsquohome of great tastersquo and the town has built up a strong reputation for producing, cooking and serving excellent food, continued Laura.ldquoWe have the monthly artisan farmersrsquo market, award winning restaurants, cafes and food shops, and a discerning customer base which comes from far and wide to avail of high quality, locally grown produce.The Chamber chairwoman said she had no doubt that creating a cafeacute culture will not only help all the businesses in Comber, but also help build upon the success of the food industry that is firmly established in the area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020

resumption of church services after they were suspended  weeks ago due to the Covid- pandemic.Services resumed on Monday after the Northern Ireland Executive announced that public worship could restart.While the parish priest of Castlewellan and Kilcoo, Fr Denis McKinley, was happy to be finally able to celebrate Mass again with his parishioners he said he remained apprehensive over some peoplersquos reluctance to follow social distancing.He said: ldquoI have noticed people are getting fed up with adhering to government guidelines especially over the course of a wake and a funeral. They seem reluctant to continue with the measures that are in place.ldquoI fear the ramications for a further spike in virus casestoo many people all come at once. I would hate to have to turn people away because there are too many already attending Mass. That would only serve to hurt people and I donrsquot want to offend anyone.Fr McKinley suggested that he may have to develop a whole new regime to facilitate parishioners attending Mass and receiving communion.He added: ldquoI have no problem with weekday Masses as the numbers who attend are certainly more manageable. However, I would much prefer to continue to celebrate Mass online on Sundays and distribute Holy Communion at the back doors of the church at a scheduled time later on that day.ldquoWhen the R rate of the virus s to zero and the threat of contamination ceases we will be a lot more relaxed about ato normality. Until then we will be monitoring the situation carefully.The Rev Owen Patterson, minister of Downpatrick Presbyterian Church, shared Fr McKinleyrsquos reservations.He said: ldquoWhile I welcome ato normality some members of our congregation are either elderly or already have underlying conditions that would make them more susceptible to the virus.ldquoWe have found our online worship on Sunday mornings has proved extremely popular. We have many more people tuning in online than we other wise would have had attending our services in Church.ldquoHopefully, we will have an increased congregation when weto Sunday worship in church. We will begin introducing services slowly but without offering a creche or Sunday School to begin with. We will review the situation carefully in August.Mr Patterson said provision had been made to have the church ready to facilitate the resumption of services.He added: ldquoWe have established pens for families who can sit together for worship and sectioned off other seating areas for the more vulnerable. Sermons will also be kept short.He said that anyone wishing to view their Sunday worship online can log on to downpatrickpresbyterian.org or visit their Facebook page for live streaming.The Dean of Down Cathedral, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said he was looking forward to beginning public worship again and welcoming everyone back this Sunday.However, he urged anyone feeling unwell not to come to church.In a letter to parishioners he said: ldquoTheto worship will be on a phased basis beginning with some of the larger churches first.ldquoWe will also adopt a dferent pattern of service times during the summer period, spreading services throughout the day.He added that face coverings were not a requirement at this stage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Driving force  ","story":"TEENAGE motor racing sensation Daniel Harper has successfully tackled the world famous Nurburgring race circuit in Germany.The  year-old from Annahilt drove the notoriously dficult -mile track for the first time when he made his debut outing in the Nurburgring Endurance Series with the BMW Junior Team.Afterwards he described it as an ldquoinvaluable learning experience, despite an unfortunate technical problem which meant he couldnrsquot contest the race itself.Harper, who has enjoyed a meteoric rise in motorsport was announced as a member of the coveted BMW Junior Team programme in January.He was completing an extensive pre-season training schedule when the coronavirus pandemic led to the postponement of the programme in March.At the start of June, he ed to Germany and last week he drove the Nurburgring mdash scene of some of motor racingrsquos greatest feats mdash as he successfully completed his DMSB permit test for the track.For the opening race event, Harper and his team-mates shared a BMW Mi Racing, the German manufacturerrsquos potent, entry-level car.

There are over , megaliths in Europe alone but the one outside Killyleagh is quite possibly the most recent of them all.It was erected in  with one thousand young people raising the so-called Strangford Stone using only their bare hands and a lot of scientic know-how.Joe speaks to the people involved in the original design and installation of the stone which was a feat in civil, mechanical and electrical engineering.Safety was a massive consideration, given that , young people were to be on site pulling the stone upright by hand into position.It is certainly a very special monument, not only because itrsquos a Millennium Stone, but also because of the remarkable way in which it was erected.Among those whom Joe talks to are Saintfieldrsquos Martyn Todd, who was heavily involved in the megalith project. His daughter, Katy, one of the volunteers who helped pull the giant stone into place.The tallest megalith in the British Isles faces the Mourne Mountains from where it was excavated.After being quarried in the Mournes, the huge stone was transported by road to the country park and was described by the Millennium Commission as ldquoone of the simplest and most directly appealing of all the year  projects.Four years before it was hauled into place, a group of people decided to bring , young people together to celebrate the start of a new millennium by pulling up the stone.They hoped, as the peace process was gaining momentum, to involve young people from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to create a lasting testament to a shared future.In November , the Millennium Commission awarded pound, to the Strangford Stone project, with the remaining costs donated as contributions in kind by all the people who worked on it.The former Down Council gave permission for Delamont to become home to the stone which is located on an elevated site which boasts superb views over Strangford Lough and towards Slieve Croob and the Mountains of Mourne.The McConnell family quarried a single block of granite weighing over  tonnes mdash the largest ever-quarried in Ireland mdash trimmed it along the grain of rock, using the ancient plug and feathers technique, to its smallest natural size, twelve and a half metres long.However, during the trimming, a weakness in the granite was discovered, resulting in the stone being split into two parts and then rejoined with three stainless steel dowels.A special steel cradle to support the stone during the pull was designed, as were special low-stretch ropes, a hydraulic safety system and the three metres deep concrete foundation for the stone. Others recruited and trained the teams of young people or provided legal, financial and insurance support for the project.Anyone unable to tune in next Monday night can watch the programme on www.itv utvprogrammes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"MP calls for Ancient East tour region to include Down  ","story":"MARKETING a large swathe of East Down on an all-island basis would help produce a signicant boost for local tourism, according to South Down MP Chris Hazzard.He has asked Stormont tourism minister Diane Dodds to work with tourism agencies on either side of the border to extend Irelandrsquos Ancient East Tourism region to include a large part of Down District.Mr Hazzard was responding to the publication of the tourism ministerrsquos lsquoeconomic recovery strategyrsquo and believes that such a move would help the South Down tourism industry recover from Covid- and help mitigate ldquothe looming Brexit shock.Mr Hazzard argues that itrsquos ldquoludicrous that Failte Irelandrsquos lsquoAncient Eastrsquo tourism region stops in Louth, excluding the historically signicant north-east region of the island.He said that a large part of East Down was the playground for Cuacute Chulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill ldquowith the landscape forever marked by St Patrickrsquos legacy, surrounded by shoreline that welcomed Vikings, Planters and the Normans.The MP said that in Downpatrick, there are the graves of the patron saint and Viking King Magnus.He continued: ldquoWe have the impressive Downpatrick and Co Down Railway Museum, the only working heritage railway in the North which stretches out to the historic Inch Abbey.ldquoUnder the shadow of Down Cathedral, we have the only St Patrickrsquos visitor exhibition in the world, with the nearby Down County Museum located in the historic buildings of the th century gaol where United Irish leader, Thomas Russell, was executed in .Mr Hazzard said the northern side of Downpatrick was surrounded by the Mound of Down, Finnebrogue Wood and the stunning Quoile Nature Reserve, with Delamont Country Park completing the short journey to the shores of Strangford Lough where the Vikings first landed.ldquoTo the east lies Struell Wells and St Patrickrsquos first church at Saul, a unique site known widely as the cradle of christianity in Ireland, the MP continued, insisting it is ldquosimply unacceptable that this rich heritage would be a victim of partitionism of the very worst kind.Mr Hazzard said local tourism providers had been hit hard by the Covid- pandemic, with many very worried about the impact of Brexit and ldquoneedless bureaucratic hurdles.He continued: ldquoUndoubtedly, they need to be supported in the years ahead and I have have written to the tourism minister asking her to look seriously at this opportunity.ldquoNow is the time to extend the lsquoAncient Eastrsquo region and also the Wild Atlantic Way coastal route into the north to encompass all that is worth seeing on the island of Ireland.He added: ldquoQuite simply, it is the best way to successfully mitigate the impact of Covid- and Brexit on the local tourism industry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"New president appointed at Downpatrick Lions Club  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK Lions Club has appointed Raymond Crea as its new president.Mr Crea succeeds Mr John Dennis, who presented him with his chain of office during a socially-distanced handover.Reflecting on his year in office, John said that while it was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, it was nevertheless rewarding, thanking his fellow club members and wider public for their enthusiasm and support.Mr Crea said he was delighted to take over an important role at the helm of the organisation.He said he looked forward to finding new ways to raise funds in what he described as ldquochallenging times for numerous charities that Downpatrick Lions support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Newcastle man Paul  climbs world’s toughest peaks  ","story":"FOR most of us sleeping on a narrow bed suspended hundreds of metres high off El Capitan, Calorniarsquos famous vertical rock wall in Yosemite Valley, would be utterly fear-inducing.Not so for mountain guide and expert rock climber Paul Swail, who first discovered his love of mountains growing up in Newcastle at the foot of the Mournes.For the  year-old, itrsquos the best nightrsquos sleep ever.ldquoYou get the most amazing nightrsquos sleep in one of those, said Paul, referring to a piece of equipment called a portaledge where rock climbers sleep and eat in during a long climb.ldquoWe spent six days climbing one of the El Cap routes and we didnrsquot want to get out of our beds in the morning.ldquoYes, we were knackered but itrsquos the comfiest thing you will ever sleep on.

They can afford to employ a mountain guide like me. Doing the Matterhorn and Eiger are much more technical guiding as it on a one to one ratio.ldquoMont Blanc is mostly snow and ice and really exposed with some sections of scrambling where with the Matterhorn, you are pretty much on your hands from the start all the way to the top and all the way back down.Mont Blanc at , metres is the high European peak outside Russia and a mountain that Paul has come to know very well. He prefers to take his clients up later during the day, descending near sunset, to avoid the growing numbers of commercial climbers.Supported by the French government during lockdown from March , Paul has been able toto guiding over the last six weeks but he was still hampered by the fact says that British and Irish people were unable to fly.Born in Vancouver to Northern Ireland parents who emigrated to Canada to escape the Troubles, Paul was  when the announcement of the first IRA ceasefire came in . A year later the family moved back and decided to settle in Newcastle.He was one of the first students to attend Shimna Integrated College at its current King Street site in Newcastle and within years Paul showed his love of the outdoors, particularly mountains.ldquoMy dad and I used to walk in the Mourne mountains, he said. ldquoI had skied in Canada, but really got into the mountains back home.ldquoMy first experience of rock climbing was being taken to Altnadue Quarry just outside Castlewellan by a family friend and I just loved it.ldquoWhile I had played soccer and done a bit of running for the school, I wasnrsquot really into sports. It was around my fth year that I really veered to be more interested in outdoor pursuits. I really didnrsquot knowI wanted it as a career but after getting into climbing, it did shape what options that I was interested in.Paul went on to do a degree in outdoor education at the University of Central Lancashire and made the Tollymore National Outdoor Centre his second home when he ed home during holidays and post-college.Once he completed college, his time was split between taking climbing and outdoor pursuit courses back home. While working in France, he would ski and climb during the day in the Alps and work in bars at night, with the sole focus of funding trips such as climbing El Capitan twice or climbing in Patagonia.He went on to become a guide with the International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations, which is the highest recognised mountaineering qualication in the world and the only qualication valid to work outside the UK and Ireland for climbing and off-piste skiing on glaciated terrain.Paulrsquos only salaried job to date was as a youth development officer for Mountaineering Ireland for four years from  based out of Tollymore where he taught young climbers the importance of enjoying the mountains responsibly and safely.Paul said: ldquoI worked every minute I could freelancing to fund the next trip and when I ran out of money, I came back home to work again. Up until my late s, I never thought much about the future, it was just living for the moment.ldquoIrsquove never really had a secure income until I had the Mountaineering Ireland job and it allowed me to buy a house in Castlewellan.While his responsibility to provide for his family is uppermost in his mind, Paul is not yet finished with his need to climb and explore mdash although, interestingly, the worldrsquos highest mountain, Everest, is not on his wish list.ldquoTherersquos a letime of climbs that I would love to do, said Paul. ldquoI love to go back to Patagonia in Argentina to climb Cerro Torre, which for me is the most beautul mountain in the world every climber dreams of standing on top of it. Or the Blasket Islands innorthern Canada would be quite high on my list.ldquoEverest has never appealed to me to go and climb as itrsquos not very dficult technically now. Itrsquos a challenge due to the seriousness of the weather and acclimatising to the attitude makes an extremely serious mountain because of its height.ldquoBut I donrsquot think you need a huge amount of skill to get up Everest and I donrsquot believe you actually have to be a rock climber. You do need to be fit and to be able to acclimatise your body to altitude and you need to have a lot of money.His friend and mentor Dawson Stelfox mdash who became the first Irish man to ascend Everest on his own in May,  mdash is something of a trailblazer to Paul.ldquoI didnrsquot realise that in , when Dawson made the summit on his own, there were no fixed ropes as there are today, there wasnrsquot the support from Sherpas and so on, said Paul.ldquoThat would appeal to meEverest was like that now, then I would love to go. But I donrsquot want to and sit and wait in a queue of  people to get to the top of the mountain.ldquoI really like to explore and there would need to be technical challenge to it as well, apart from overcoming the physical challenges and altitude.ldquoIf you were to take El Cap and put it somewhere a bit remote where it would take you a couple of days to get to it and very few people have climbed it, you would have about , metres of vertical rock to climb.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

I feel so sorry for these poor souls just opening.Since Monday June  many cones were removed from parking bays around the town, and the council respondedby placing heavier steel restrictions in some bays instead.Mr Snell says he has become less busy since the restrictions were applied, and that he worries of the impact on Penarthrsquos older demographic.ldquoYoursquore telling them itrsquos unsafe to use public transport, and they canrsquot park near the shops when they get here ndash so theyrsquoll go where,\" he added.Ceri McCann, Karen Hatton and Rachel Came, who jointly run Andrearsquos Flower Boutique, echoed Mr Snellrsquos sentiments. and this Tuesday \" alt\"Penarth Times: Glebe Street last Tuesdayand this Tuesday \" class\"editor-image\"Glebe Street last Tuesdayand this Tuesday ldquoItrsquos more important than ever now to encourage people to come to Penarth and support local traders, they said, ldquoand itrsquos very worrying that this is what wersquove ed to.ldquoOn the Saturdaywe came back and had a sheet through our door informing us of the restrictions, and there was a van here on the day putting out the cones.ldquoIn the space of a couple of hours pretty much all our parking had gone.ldquoIn an ideal world it would be greatpeople were able to walk into town, but realistically Penarth is a pretty spread out town and it will adversely impact businessthis continues.ldquoItrsquos no use encouraging people to spend locally and then encourage them to leave town and head to the supermarket.Resident Gaynor Woolford said there has been a parking issue in the town for some time, which has been exacerbated by the new restrictions.Gaynor WoolfordldquoOften Irsquoll come to have a coffee with my friend and she will ring and tell me she canrsquot find a space, she said. ldquoWe either go where, or we donrsquot spend much time in the shops.       ,params: .pushldquoItrsquos an important issue because we want our wonderful and self-sufficient town to stay vibrant after lockdown.ldquoWe know it will take time butthere is a negative and unwelcoming message now then I fear the town might not recover and reach the same levels again.Angelina Hall, chair of the Penarth Business Group and an acting liaison between Vale council and businesses, said she understands the concerns.ldquoWe are in constant dialogue with the council and understand that it is trying its best to come up with a workable solution, she said.Windsor Road on TuesdayldquoThis is not set in stone and we are inviting businessrsquos feedback.ldquoThe key issue is thathospitality is toand do more than just survive, it needs the space to expand outside.ldquoI do think Vale council should consider lting some of the restrictions, such as at Ludlow Lane and parts of Glebe Street, which at the moment seem unnecessary.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe decisions on where such alterations to parking provision were made was based on Welsh and UK Government guidance.ldquoWe hope that rather than reduce the number of visitors to our town centres, the measures will create a safe environment that makes shopping in these areas more attractive.ldquoMeetings were held with traders ahead of their introduction and we have been working with local businesses and Town Councils on this matter to achieve a satisfactory outcome for all.ldquoTo that end and to address concerns raised, we will soon be amending safety measures in Glebe Street to free up parking bays where there is no signicant impact on pedestrian safety. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy

Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a

Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has delayed completion of council’s largest capital project to date, with the centre now expected to open in October.Built by Farrans, the new centre will boast a  metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site cafe.Before this delay, it was estimatedthat the centre would cost approximately £ million.

on public transport from july  ","story":"FACE coverings will become mandatory on public transport from Friday July  as part of the recovery process from Covid-, to support efforts to reduce the risk of transmission. From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:    n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cfebeffaebdc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebabeabcbebdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
