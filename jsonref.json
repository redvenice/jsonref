(Picture: AP)Theresa May said today she had authorised British forces to conduct precision air-launched cruise missile strikes on Syria to degrade its chemical weapons capability – adding that there ‘was no other choice’.Four Royal Air Force Tornado jets using Storm Shadow missiles had taken part in the attack on a military facility near Homs where it was assessed Syria had stockpiled chemicals, Britain’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) said.It came after intelligence indicated Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government was responsible for an attack using chemical weapons in Douma last Saturday.The Prime Minister said the missile strike was designed to minimise any civilian casualties and was not an attempt to change the Syrian government.In a statement, she said: ‘This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.’Smoke rises in Syria after US-led airstrikes targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus (Picture: SANA AP)Britain’s defence ministry said initial indications were that the precision weapons and meticulous target planning had ‘resulted in a successful attack’May said Britain and the West had an obligation to deter both Assad and others from using chemical weapons after the poison gas attack in Douma near Damascus killed up to 75 people including children.‘So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime,’ she said.The Western missile strikes demonstrate the volatile nature of the Syrian civil war, which started in March 2011 as an anti-Assad uprising but is now a proxy conflict involving a number of world and regional powers and a myriad of insurgent groups.A picture released by the French Defence audiovisual communication and production unit (ECPAD) shows the launching of a cruise missile from a French military vessel in the Mediterranean sea towards targets in Syria overnight (Picture: AFP)US President Donald Trump said he was prepared to sustain the response until the government of Assad stopped its use of chemical weapons.Russia, which intervened in the war in 2015 to back Assad, has denied there was a chemical attack and has accused Britain of helping to stage the Douma incident to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.‘The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk,’ the MoD said in a statement.May said while the strike was targeted at Syria, it sent a message to anyone who used chemical weapons.Syrian soldiers hold their weapons as they dance and chant slogans against US President Trump during demonstrations following a wave of US, British and French military strikes to punish President Bashar Assad for suspected chemical attack against civilians (Picture: AP)Britain has accused Russia of being behind last month’s nerve agent attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, southern England, a charge Moscow has rejected.‘This is the first time as prime minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat and it is not a decision I have taken lightly,’ she said.Man wins \u0027right to have crime forgotten\u0027 against Google‘I have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain’s national interest.‘We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.’Many politicians in Britain, including some in May’s own Conservative Party, had called for parliament to be recalled from a break to give authority to any military strike.RAF Tornados taking-off on a sortie at RAF Akrotiri to conduct strikes in support of Operations over the Middle East (Picture: PA)Former Prime Minister David Cameron lost a parliamentary vote on air strikes against Assad’s forces in 2013 when 30 Conservative lawmakers voted against action, with many Britons wary of entering another conflict after intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region.May is not obliged to win parliament’s approval before ordering military action, but a non-binding constitutional convention to do so has been established since a 2003 vote on joining the US-led invasion of Iraq.Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had said Britain should press for an independent U.N.-led investigation into the suspected chemical attack in Douma rather than wait for instructions from Trump on how to proceed.Former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, now head of humanitarian relief group the International Rescue Committee, said military action needed to be part of a wider political strategy.‘Bombing cannot substitute for diplomacy,’ he said."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sei_5717756.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"won masterchef uk 2018","story":"Masterchef finished last night, but who won the trophy?

By this point in the month the number is lower than hoped for.\u0027She added that the tussle between the warm air from the South and the wet weather in the West - which will bring rain to most places on Sunday - will finally be won by the continental influence on Monday.Ms Kent said temperatures in the south-east could hit 59F (15C) or 61F (16C) at the start of the working week.She said: \u0027By Tuesday across London we could see 18C (64F), maybe 19C (66F). By Wednesday, there\u0027s still going to be some patchy rain in parts of the north-west but England and Wales will have this continental air coming in.\u0027So, dry weather for them, plenty of sunshine again. Temperatures on Wednesday will again be highest in the South East. London could see between 20C and 23C.             \u0027And in fact, going further north, places like York could see 18C to 20c. And, even for Glasgow, it could be 17C or 18C on Wednesday.\u0027Ms Kent said: \u0027The trend into the end of the week is to continue this feed of warmer continental air across England and Wales. \u0027Those frontal systems are always trying to battle into the north-west, so it could be cloudier there with some more mixed weather at times.\u0027But, by the end of the week, in the that far south-eastern corner we could see temperatures into the low to mid-20s.\u0027Ms Kent said that these temperatures will be above the average for mid April.

They now have two young children.The relationship between father and daughter has now fractured so badly they are facing each other across a courtroom, arguing over ownership of a flat in London, a house in Surrey, cash from four properties in the USA and 23 items of jewellery which belonged to Mrs Wamsteker’s dead mother, said to be worth about £1million in total.Judge Simon Monty QC, at Central London County Court, heard that Mrs Wamsteker, who lives in Canary Wharf, East London, has been practicing law in London for 17 years and previously worked for accounting giants Ernst and Young.Her father, who lives in Stratford, East London, told the court that he is also a qualified lawyer.The pair had always been close in their personal and financial lives, sharing a mutually \u0027loving and generous\u0027 relationship as the family built up a portfolio of properties across London, the USA and Malaysia.But that was before rows over their respective choice of partners following the death of Mrs Wamsteker’s mother - Mr David’s first wife - in 2008, tore the family apart.When her widowed father \u0027formed an attachment to and subsequently married\u0027 her  nanny, Mrs Wamsteker \u0027objected strongly to the relationship, describing it as ‘unthinkably repugnant’, the judge was told.Britney Spears and Will.i.am lose legal battle against...Tiger Woods embroiled in legal battle with his ex-girlfriend...Share this articleThe pensioner accepted that he \u0027doesn’t like\u0027 his daughter’s husband, 52-year-old investment director Adrianus Wamsteker, but denied accusations that he had previously threatened him with an axe.The father and daughter’s dislike of each other’s partners, and particularly Mr David’s marriage to her au pair, \u0027has resulted in the wholesale breakdown of the close relationship between them,\u0027 Mrs Wamsteker’s barrister, Desmond Kilcoyne, told the judge.\u0027The existing litigation is now motivated by a high degree of animosity by Mr David towards his daughter and particularly her husband,\u0027 he added.The English properties at stake in the case are a four-bedroom detached bungalow in Salisbury Road, Worcester Park, Surrey, previously marketed for £740,000, and a flat in Selsdon Road, West Ham, East London, worth about £275,000.Mr David says that he is the \u0027beneficial owner\u0027 of both properties - despite them being in his daughter’s name - having stumped up the deposits for them both and either \u0027funded\u0027 or made \u0027contributions\u0027 to their mortgages.          Audra Wamsteker, 49, and her husband Adrianus Wamsteker are pictured outside court as she battles her father for her dead mother\u0027s jewellery and international property portfolio As well as a declaration that he owns the properties, Mr David wants his daughter to pay him around £150,000 in rent for having \u0027excluded\u0027 him from the house and the flat since 2013.He also claims he paid for four properties in Florida which were sold in 2014 and is now \u0027entitled to the proceeds of sale\u0027, which Mrs Wamsteker currently holds.Finally Mr David is demanding his daughter return to him 23 items of his late first wife’s jewellery.Mr Kilcoyne, for Mrs Wamsteker, told the judge that she denies her father has ever owned any of the properties.She also refuses to give up her late mother’s jewellery as she says it was \u0027a gift\u0027 by her father before their relationship broke down.Mr David, who is representing himself and is backed by his son Alvin - also a qualifed lawyer - told the judge from the witness box that the jewellery, along with a box of her deceased mother’s clothes, \u0027were not given to her, but taken to her house for safekeeping\u0027.Mr Kilcoyne pointed to emails he said proved the gift had been made, in one of which Mr David told his daughter: \u0027It’s no use keeping something you’ve been given by someone you hate so bitterly.\u0027But Mr David told the judge he gave Mrs Wamsteker only one item - \u0027a gold chain with pearls on it\u0027 - plus another item to her daughter, and she had wrongfully kept the rest.Mr Kilcoyne told Mr David: \u0027There have been a number of arrangements between you and your daughter, at the end of which arrangements she owns property. You gave that jewellery to her and now you want it back.\u0027\u0027Nothing has been given away,\u0027 he responded.Telling the judge about the close relationship he used to enjoy with his daughter, Mr David said: \u0027She told me, mummy made me swear that I’d look after you to your dying day.’Mr Kilcoyne agreed there used to be a \u0027very close bond\u0027 between them, adding: \u0027You said your daughter thinks of you like a god.\u0027But there had been a darker side to their relationship, the barrister claimed.\u0027There’s an aspect of the relationship where she has felt unable to say no to you...she says you used to badger her for money...you felt entitled to ask her for money. You demanded money, you badgered her for money,\u0027 he put to Mr David.The pensioner denied the allegations saying: \u0027She makes me look like some sort of gangster...I look like a horrible man standing here.\u0027I still love both my children,\u0027 he told the judge.Mr Kilcoyne also alleged that Mr David had threatened his daughter’s husband with an axe. \u0027You told her you would destroy her and kill her husband,\u0027 he said. Mr David replied: \u0027No. The axe was in my bedroom drawer. If I had approached him with an axe like she says, I would have hurt him. That’s true I dislike him. I don’t deny it, I don’t like him.\u0027I realised what he was when he married my daughter in 2004. She’s got a very greedy husband,\u0027 he told the judge.Alvin David, Mrs Wamsteker’s brother and Mr David’s son, who lives in New Maldon with his family, outside court valued the property, jewellery and money claims being brought by his father against his sister at around £1m. The hearing continues. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/12/08/04D7E4AB000007D0-0-image-m-5_1523518559531.jpg","title":"Horrific moment female worker","story":"\u0027Guardian angel\u0027: Alexander Vysotsky is being hailed as a hero in Russia after he stepped in to save 28-year-old Ekaterina, right, from an \u0027attempted rape\u0027 The footage shows the victim bravely resisting, backing away towards the door and even grabbing the blade of the knife.He is seen forcing her  to the ground and pulling at her skirt. We\u0027ve got a dossier too!

Fortunately the guides had drilled it into our heads that if anything happens, don\u0027t run, don\u0027t run!\u0027After about an hour-and-a-half we came out of forest and looked up and about 100 metres away saw an elephant at the top of a little hill. \u0027We stopped immediately admired it and then suddenly it charged us.\u0027Mr Larsen continued: \u0027Dean our lead guide said, \u0027Don\u0027t move!\u0027, so we stood there frozen in terror as the elephant charged down the hill at us.\u0027 I\u0027m a pretty calm person. I don\u0027t yell and scream in a car crash. But I was scared to death.\u0027Straight away Dean had moved forward and become the target. He put his arm up and yelled \u0027Whoooa!\u0027 and about 10 metres away the elephant stopped dead in its tracks. \u0027It was unbelievable. It looked like something out of a cartoon. His front feet dug into the ground in a cloud of dust. I could not believe what I was seeing.\u0027With his right arm raised Dean was loudly commanding the elephant and it backed off. It was surreal.

You could see it was angry and meant business.\u0027After the third time the elephant moved off and all I could think of then was get us out of here.\u0027I watched it, relieved, and thought I looked like a child stomping off because Dean hadn\u0027t let it get its own way. \u0027It was flapping its ears and throwing sand over its back.

Bristol Crown Court (pictured) heard Ah\u0027Kiell had suffered brain injuries potentially caused by shaking, and may have been immersed in waterA post-mortem examination found Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s death was caused by a lack of oxygen to his brain, with a pathologist also finding four older fractures to his ribs and a fracture to his shoulder.Jurors have been told that Walker was \u0027obsessed\u0027 with Ah\u0027Kiell\u0027s constipation and fed him water through bottles with the teat cut to increase the flow.Accounts given by Walker and Henry in police interviews do not explain his injuries, prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC said.Following the death, officers examined phones used by Henry and Walker.They revealed that Henry had told friends she wanted to end her relationship with Walker by the time Ah\u0027Kiell was nine or 10 weeks old.During the same period, internet searches were made on Walker\u0027s phone including \u0027shaken baby syndrome\u0027, \u0027can I squeeze my baby\u0027, \u0027internal bleeding due to trauma\u0027 and \u0027baby broken ribs\u0027.One search, on June 14, asked: \u0027Can babies feel pain?\u0027, followed by \u0027baby burst liver\u0027.Henry, of Tuffley, Gloucestershire, and Walker, of Lansdowne Green, London, deny all the charges against them."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/18/4B123D1100000578-5613355-There_are_many_theories_regarding_the_provenance_of_the_term_420-a-23_1523639963813.jpg","title":"What 420 weed day","story":"    420 is an unofficial celebration of cannabis when people rally and call for its legalisationOrigins of 420Many people erroneously believe that the term 420 is a reference to several things including: the police code for the drug in the US the number in the California penal code that is about the distribution of marijuana the deaths and anniversaries of various celebrities including Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison and Bob Marley the number of chemical compounds in cannabis.They are not: 420 is not even a code in the NYPD or the LAPD. San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to knowThe Sandlot cast reunite 25 years on ahead of 25th anniversaryCoachella 2018: Yodelling Walmart kid Mason Ramsey could perform with Post MaloneEndometriosis: What is it, what are the symptoms and how can it be treated?"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/13/17/4B1D5D9200000578-0-image-a-15_1523636424387.jpg","title":"Adorable polar bear cub goes swim walk outdoors born Germany","story":"    This is the adorable moment a polar bear cub goes for her first wander outdoors with her mother and takes a leisurely swim          Little Nanook made her first steps outside today beside her 13-year-old mother, Lara, as they travelled out of their cave for the first time since the tot was born          The polar bear cub was seen inspecting her enclosure and discovering new wonders as she enjoyed her first outing  Nanook was born on December 4 last year at the zoo (pictured) in Gelsenkirchen, western Germany, alongside two siblings who died within two days          The 18-week-old bear now weighs around 22 kilograms and fans across the nation came to see the little one in her enclosure.

Occasionally, she’ll be a-ish if she’s asked to do anything she doesn’t want to. On one shoot, she had to wear a silly Christmas hat and I could tell she wasn’t best pleased.She does this thing where it sounds like she’s muttering under her breath. When she had the hat on, she turned to one of the young boys sitting next to her and ‘muttered’. It was hilarious.And sometimes she likes to keep people waiting to get that great shot.

Roo, a five-year-old Dalmation, lives with Stephen Smythe, 65, a retired company director, and his wife, Carola, 63, in Central LondonIt wasn’t the first time that someone had told us we had a good-looking dog. It was my daughter who suggested I sign her up to a modelling agency. She’s done a variety of campaigns for brands such as Cath Kidston, Sainbury’s and McDonald’s. Photographers tell us that her contrasting markings make her very attractive: she’s not too black and not too white.The Cath Kidston shoot was particularly crazy because it involved more than 30 dogs recreating a scene from 101 Dalmations to promote a range of black and white clothes. Funnily enough, Roo’s grandmother actually starred as one of the 101 dogs in the 1996 version of the film.Roo took it all in her stride and we even bumped into her brother, which was a rather sweet moment.We don’t treat her as any kind of superstar: she’s simply our family pet who we treat occasionally to the odd grooming session at the vet. She’s well-behaved on shoots, apart from the time she had a little accident on the floor of a studio.It was my fault as I’d been rushing around all morning and had forgotten to let her do her business.Another time, she vomited after eating a huge bowl of food that was being photographed alongside her.

He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, Berkshire. Bronia says:It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star. I was appearing in panto with him and it was around the time that Pudsey the dog had won Britain’s Got Talent. Shane thought it would be funny to ‘do a Pudsey’ and get Archie to perform ‘tricks’ with him. Shane would then swap him for a toy dog and pretend that Archie was flying across the stage. The children in the audience couldn’t believe their eyes, but the adults were in fits of laughter.          Archie is an eight-year-old West Highland terrier. He lives with Bronia Pearce, 33, a professional dancer, in Reading, BerkshireAfterwards, I sent Archie’s details off to the PetLondon modelling agency. He did a huge campaign for the pet charity PDSA last Christmas and his face was plastered all over the Tube and railway stations, and he was on television, too.We get around six jobs a year and every time we are booked for a shoot I ask if the client wants his fur long or short. Some people like them to look a bit fluffier.We give him a bath before each shoot, which he enjoys, and use a lovely coconut shampoo on him so his fur comes out ice-white.Once, when we did a shoot for Boden, we had to travel to London in the pouring rain and arrived with Archie looking like a drowned rat. The styling team thought it was hilarious that he sat there, quite happily, while I used a hairdryer on him and he fluffed up in no time.Terriers are often quite excitable but Archie’s a professional and he’ll often fall asleep while waiting to be called. I keep bits of chicken with me to encourage him to behave.If I use the word ‘Walk’, he will tilt his head in a very cute way. Sometimes he’s booked for jobs simply for that tilt of the head.  \u0027It was actor Shane Ritchie who first made Archie a star.

He lives with owner Nicola Kazan, 33, a dog groomer, her husband Tufik, 33, a tailor, and son Theo, five, in Eton, Berkshire. Nicola says:Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’. There are not many red poodles in the UK, particularly in this apricot shade, so it’s no wonder he feels special.He’s a stud dog from the Czech Republic and originally belonged to my friend. One of her other poodles didn’t get on with Edward, so I asked if I could have him. He’s loving, intelligent and likes to be the centre of attention.Someone at ITV needed a red poodle for a show and got in touch after seeing Edward’s picture on Instagram. I then contacted the Urban Paws agency.          Edward definitely knows he’s different to other dogs. He has a cool confidence about him as if to say: ‘I’m better than you’Edward loved modelling from the very start. He’s appeared in various fashion campaigns, but the most high-profile is Stella McCartney.It was the Chinese Year of the Dog and her team wanted beautiful dogs to model her clothes. I’d never dressed Edward up in any outfits, but I said we’d give it a go.Edward couldn’t get enough of the fuss and attention. At one stage, he had two stylists preening and primping him and was wearing a gold dress that was easily worth more than £1,000.Then something caught his eye and he started racing around the studio. My heart stopped. I thought he’d ruin the dress — but he soon calmed down and we got some gorgeous shots.Once a week, I will shampoo and condition him, then dry him and make sure there are no knots. It takes around 45 minutes each time and he loves being brushed. He stands still like a statue.The money he earns varies, but usually it’s around £400 a day. I’m not allowed to say how much we were paid for the Stella job but I used £200 of it to treat Edward to a teeth-cleaning session at the vet.  Edward is a four-year-old miniature ‘red’ poodle.

Tom Ford has pet wire fox terriers, so we think that’s the reason Humphrey was chosen.The shoot wasn’t without its stresses for me. Humphrey is just a regular dog — he doesn’t do any tricks — and I had no idea how he’d behave. But he has such a lovely temperament and immediately bonded with everyone on set.His ‘instructions’ were to follow the male model around his flat as he got dressed for a night out, but at one stage Humphrey had to sit still. To keep him in one place, I had to hide behind the sofa, holding my hand out and saying: ‘Stay, Humphrey, stay.’ Thankfully, he did.At one point, he had to follow the model to the door when the doorbell rang. I didn’t think he’d do it, but he did — and got a round of applause from the team.Dogs are supposed to know their place, but now that he’s a high-end fashion model, I think Humphrey may get ideas above his station.Archie, Roo and Iraida provided by PetLondon – www.petlondonmodels.com   \u0027Ever since Humphrey was a puppy we’ve been stopped in the street by strangers asking if they can take his photograph.

Housing minister Dominic Raab faced criticism after he claimed net immigration had added 20 per cent to house prices in 25 yearsThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government used a model developed by the University of Reading, which found the increase in the number of immigrants living in England between 1991 and 2016 had added an extra £11,000 to average prices, in real terms.But leading economist Jonathan Portes criticised the model, saying it was ‘worse than the back of an envelope’.Mr Raab last week passed his concerns on to the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which is to publish a report to help the Government formulate new immigration plans.

This means that immigration accounts for 21 per cent of the population-related increase on house prices.Rises in average incomes were responsible for a 150 per cent increase in house prices.The Ministry of Housing was forced to publish the figures to back up its claim that immigration had driven up house prices after the UK statistics watchdog demanded to see its modelling.

At the same time you can’t just airbrush the costs and the impact it has on housing.’But Mr Portes, a professor of economics at King’s College London, said the model was not reliable. He added: ‘This is worse than amateurback of envelope – I’m genuinely shocked the ministry would publish this.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/00/44F5977900000578-0-image-m-20_1523662699341.jpg","title":"NINE Cabinet ministers making 10 000 year renting properties","story":"    Jeremy Hunt was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interestsNine cabinet ministers including Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are making a fortune renting out properties, it was revealed. The Secretary of State for Housing, Sajid Javid, is also among the group of politicians raking in more than £10,000 from flats and houses they own. It comes after Mr Hunt failed to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he later rented out.  He was yesterday forced to issue an apology after he failed to declare a business interest with Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs\u0027 interests. A spokesman for No 10 said: \u0027Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the Ministerial Code.

In a statement, the PM said the decision was one she had not taken lightly and was done in the national interest. Four RAF Tornados took off from RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus in the early hours and struck regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weaponsThe attack was focused on regime facilities linked to the production and use of chemical weapons. Declaring his support, French President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the United States and Britain have launched a military operation against the Syrian government\u0027s \u0027clandestine chemical arsenal.\u0027Macron said in a statement on Saturday that France\u0027s \u0027red line has been crossed\u0027 after a suspected chemical attack last week in the Syrian town of Douma.He says there is \u0027no doubt\u0027 that the Syrian government is responsible.          Smoke could be seen rising after the overnight airstrikes that targeted military facilities in the Syrian capital, Damascus          The British missions against targets in Syria were launched the RAF Akrotiri base near Limassol on Cyprus in the early hoursMacron added the operation is limited to Syria\u0027s abilities to produce chemical weapons, and would not give details about what equipment is involved in the operation or what sites it is targeting.   Despite the ferocity of the Allied strikes, Syrian air defences claim to have shot down 13 missiles fired in the attack, Syrian state TV said. The missiles had been shot down in the Kiswah area south of Damascus.Shortly after the strike, the MOD released a statement, stating: \u0027The UK element of the carefully coordinated joint action was contributed by four Royal Air Force Tornado GR4s. \u0027They launched Storm Shadow missiles at a military facility – a former missile base – some fifteen miles west of Homs, where the regime is assessed to keep chemical weapon precursors stockpiled in breach of Syria\u0027s obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. \u0027Very careful scientific analysis was applied to determine where best to target the Storm Shadows to maximise the destruction of the stockpiled chemicals and to minimise any risks of contamination to the surrounding area. The facility which was struck is located some distance from any known concentrations of civilian habitation, reducing yet further any such risk.

Let these united actions send a clear message to the regime – the use of chemical weapons is categorically unacceptable and you will be held to account.\u0027    US Defense Secretary James Mattis says the US and its allies have taken \u0027decisive action\u0027 against Syrian chemical weapons infrastructure.Mattis briefed reporters at the Pentagon Friday an hour after President Donald Trump announced the strike.Mattis said the United States, along with France and the United Kingdom, struck because Syrian President Bashar Assad \u0027did not get the message\u0027 when the U.S. launched airstrikes after a chemical attack in 2017.The defense secretary said Friday\u0027s strikes have \u0027sent a clear message\u0027 to Assad and his \u0027murderous lieutenants.\u0027Mattis said the strikes are \u0027directed at the Syrian regime\u0027 and they have \u0027gone to great lengths to avoid civilians and foreign casualties.\u0027Mattis said the U.S. has no reports of suffering any losses during the initial airstrikes on Syria Friday. Mattis said \u0027right now this is a one-time shot\u0027 but is not ruling out further attacks. President Donald Trump had said earlier that the campaign against the regime of Bashar Assad could be \u0027sustained.\u0027The defense secretary says the airstrikes were launched against several sites that he says helped provide Assad\u0027s ability to create chemical weapons.Mattis said he is \u0027absolutely confident\u0027 that Syrian President Bashar Assad is behind the alleged chemical attack on his people that the U.S. and allies retaliated against Friday night.He says the U.S. is \u0027very much aware of one of the chemical agents used.\u0027 And he says there may have been a second.        Yesterday details emerged of a Cabinet meeting the PM held on Thursday where she won the backing of her ministers to proceed without a parliamentary vote.She told Cabinet: \u0027Since 1918 we have worked to uphold the international norm that chemical weapons are abhorrent and must never be used. In recent years that international norm has been eroded and that should be a matter of deep concern to us all. The use of chemical weapons should not go unchallenged.\u0027The Prime Minister said Britain had to act in order to restore that norm, because the weapons inflict human misery. Downing Street sources said she made the point that these weapons had been used a number of times in Syria – and also in Salisbury.          \u0027These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster instead,\u0027 Mr Trump said referring to Assad (pictured)The need to restore international norms was shared by the whole Cabinet, Downing Street sources said. They said: \u0027Cabinet have been impressed that from the off she has been very robust and very clear. She was the most hawkish.\u0027Russia\u0027s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, held a press conference at his residence accusing Britain of peddling myths about Russia\u0027s activities.At one point he compared allegations that the Syrian government had gassed its own people to Tony Blair\u0027s claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.He also suggested the alleged use of chemical weapons was a hoax and may have been used to discredit Assad. The Russian embassy in the UK said: \u0027Military strikes may be used to cover up all the evidence, or lack thereof, on the ground.\u0027Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the military had \u0027proof that testifies to the direct participation of Britain in the organising of this provocation in eastern Ghouta\u0027.          Theresa May\u0027s statement in full \u0027This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime\u0027s chemical weapons capability and deter their use.\u0027We are acting together with our American and French allies.\u0027In Douma, last Saturday a chemical weapons attack killed up to 75 people, including young children, in circumstances of pure horror.\u0027The fact of this attack should surprise no-one.\u0027The Syrian Regime has a history of using chemical weapons against its own people in the most cruel and abhorrent way.\u0027And a significant body of information including intelligence indicates the Syrian Regime is responsible for this latest attack.\u0027This persistent pattern of behaviour must be stopped – not just to protect innocent people in Syria from the horrific deaths and casualties caused by chemical weapons but also because we cannot allow the erosion of the international norm that prevents the use of these weapons.\u0027We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.\u0027But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted. Even this week the Russians vetoed a Resolution at the UN Security Council which would have established an independent investigation into the Douma attack.\u0027So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian Regime.\u0027This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.\u0027It is about a limited and targeted strike that does not further escalate tensions in the region and that does everything possible to prevent civilian casualties.\u0027And while this action is specifically about deterring the Syrian Regime, it will also send a clear signal to anyone else who believes they can use chemical weapons with impunity.\u0027At this time, my thoughts are with our brave British servicemen and women – and our French and American partners – who are carrying out their duty with the greatest professionalism.\u0027The speed with which we are acting is essential in co-operating with our partners to alleviate further humanitarian suffering and to maintain the vital security of our operations.\u0027This is the first time as Prime Minister that I have had to take the decision to commit our armed forces in combat – and it is not a decision I have taken lightly.\u0027I have done so because I judge this action to be in Britain\u0027s national interest.\u0027We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – within Syria, on the streets of the UK, or anywhere else in our world.\u0027We would have preferred an alternative path. But on this occasion there is none.\u0027History teaches us that the international community must defend the global rules and standards that keep us all safe.\u0027That is what our country has always done. And what we will continue to do. \u0027                                                          President Trump\u0027s Friday night address My fellow Americans: a short time ago I ordered the United States armed forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 percent of the Syrian air force.Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians, this time in the town of Douma near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by the very terrible regime. the evil and despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man. They are crimes of a monster, instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilized nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation.The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power -- military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran and to Russia I ask, what kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants and murderous dictators. In 2013 President Putin and his government promised the world they would guarantee the elimination of Syria\u0027s chemical weapons. Assad\u0027s recent attack and today\u0027s response are the direct result of Russia\u0027s failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or if it will join with civilized nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully some day we\u0027ll get along with Russia and maybe even Uran, but maybe not. I will say this, the United States has a lot to offer with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria the United States with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 percent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS.America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria. Under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home and great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It\u0027s a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of World War I, more than 1 million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly specter return. So today, the nations of Britain, France and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God there guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America. Thank you, and good night. Thank you. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/01/4B1F781C00000578-0-image-a-2_1523665988465.jpg","title":"Family 14 living four bedroom house mother claims evicted","story":"    Patricia Newman, 33, and her six children have moved into her mother\u0027s home - already occupied by seven other members of her familyDorothy, of Mersey Road in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, also shares her home with her two adult sons and their collective four children, over whom she has guardianship.The grandmother-of-ten said: \u0027Patricia and the children really need rehousing - the children need their own home with their mother.\u0027I have guardianship of four kids and it is hard work having that many children here.\u0027I am out looking after my mother who is seriously ill with heart problems among other illnesses.

Now Rovelli is back to explore the mysteries of time. He tells  Charlotte Higgins about student revolution and how his quantum leap began with an acid trip• Extract from Carlo Rovelli’s new book: on the elastic concept of time What do we know about time? Language tells us that it “passes”, it moves like a great river, inexorably dragging us with it, and, in the end, washes us up on its shore while it continues, unstoppable. Time flows. It moves ever forwards. Or does it? Poets also tell us that time stumbles or creeps or slows or even, at times, seems to stop. They tell us that the past might be inescapable, immanent in objects or people or landscapes. When Juliet is waiting for Romeo, time passes sluggishly: she longs for Phaethon to take the reins of the Sun’s chariot, since he would whip up the horses and “bring in cloudy night immediately”. When we wake from a vivid dream we are dimly aware that the sense of time we have just experienced is illusory.Carlo Rovelli is an Italian theoretical physicist who wants to make the uninitiated grasp the excitement of his field. His book Seven Brief Lessons on Physics, with its concise, sparkling essays on subjects such as black holes and quanta, has sold 1.3m copies worldwide. Now comes The Order of Time, a dizzying, poetic work in which I found myself abandoning everything I thought I knew about time – certainly the idea that it “flows”, and even that it exists at all, in any profound sense.We meet outside the church of San Petronio in Bologna, where Rovelli studied. (“I like to say that, just like Copernicus, I was an undergraduate at Bologna and a graduate at Padua,” he jokes.) A cheery, compact fellow in his early 60s, Rovelli is in nostalgic mood. He lives in Marseille, where, since 2010, he has run the quantum gravity group at the Centre de physique théorique. Before that, he was in the US, at the University of Pittsburgh, for a decade.He rarely visits Bologna, and he has been catching up with old friends. We wander towards the university area. Piazza Verdi is flocked with a lively crowd of students. There are flags and graffiti and banners, too – anti-fascist slogans, something in support of the Kurds, a sign enjoining passers-by not to forget Giulio Regeni, the Cambridge PhD student killed in Egypt in 2016.“In my day it was barricades and police,” he says. He was a passionate student activist, back then. What did he and his pals want? “Small things! We wanted a world without boundaries, without state, without war, without religion, without family, without school, without private property.”He was, he says now, too radical, and it was hard, trying to share possessions, trying to live without jealousy. And then there was the LSD. He took it a few times. And it turned out to be the seed of his interest in physics generally, and in the question of time specifically. “It was an extraordinarily strong experience that touched me also intellectually,” he remembers. “Among the strange phenomena was the sense of time stopping. Things were happening in my mind but the clock was not going ahead the flow of time was not passing any more. It was a total subversion of the structure of reality. He had hallucinations of misshapen objects, of bright and dazzling colours – but also recalls thinking during the experience, actually asking himself what was going on.“And I thought: ‘Well, it’s a chemical that is changing things in my brain. But how do I know that the usual perception is right, and this is wrong? If these two ways of perceiving are so different, what does it mean that one is the correct one?’” The way he talks about LSD is, in fact, quite similar to his description of reading Einstein as a student, on a sun-baked Calabrian beach, and looking up from his book imagining the world not as it appeared to him every day, but as the wild and undulating spacetime that the great physicist described. Reality, to quote the title of one of his books, is not what it seems.He gave his conservative, Veronese parents a bit of a fright, he says. His father, now in his 90s, was surprised when young Carlo’s lecturers said he was actually doing all right, despite the long hair and radical politics and the occasional brush with the police. It was after the optimistic sense of student revolution in Italy came to an abrupt end with the kidnapping and murder of the former prime minister, Aldo Moro, in 1978 that Rovelli began to take physics seriously. But his route to his big academic career was circuitous and unconventional. “Nowadays everyone is worried because there is no work. When I was young, the problem was how to avoid work. I did not want to become part of the ‘productive system’,” he says.Academia, then, seemed like a way of avoiding the world of a conventional job, and for some years he followed his curiosity without a sense of careerist ambition. He went to Trento in northern Italy to join a research group he was interested in, sleeping in his car for a few months (“I’d get a shower in the department to be decent”). He went to London, because he was interested in the work of Chris Isham, and then to the US, to be near physicists such as Abhay Ashtekar and Lee Smolin. “My first paper was horrendously late compared to what a young person would have to do now. And this was a privilege – I knew more things, there was more time.”The popular books, too, have come relatively late, after his academic study of quantum gravity, published in 2004. If Seven Brief Lessons was a lucid primer, The Order of Time takes things further it deals with “what I really do in science, what I really think in depth, what is important for me”.Rovelli’s work as a physicist, in crude terms, occupies the large space left by Einstein on the one hand, and the development of quantum theory on the other. If the theory of general relativity describes a world of curved spacetime where everything is continuous, quantum theory describes a world in which discrete quantities of energy interact. In Rovelli’s words, “quantum mechanics cannot deal with the curvature of spacetime, and general relativity cannot account for quanta”.Both theories are successful but their apparent incompatibility is an open problem, and one of the current tasks of theoretical physics is to attempt to construct a conceptual framework in which they both work. Rovelli’s field of loop theory, or loop quantum gravity, offers a possible answer to the problem, in which spacetime itself is understood to be granular, a fine structure woven from loops.String theory offers another, different route towards solving the problem. When I ask him what he thinks about the possibility that his loop quantum gravity work may be wrong, he gently explains that being wrong isn’t the point being part of the conversation is the point. And anyway, “If you ask who had the longest and most striking list of results it’s Einstein without any doubt. But if you ask who is the scientist who made most mistakes, it’s still Einstein.”How does time fit in to his work? Time, Einstein long ago showed, is relative – time passes more slowly for an object moving faster than another object, for example. In this relative world, an absolute “now” is more or less meaningless. Time, then, is not some separate quality that impassively flows around us. Time is, in Rovelli’s words, “part of a complicated geometry woven together with the geometry of space”.For Rovelli, there is more: according to his theorising, time itself disappears at the most fundamental level. His theories ask us to accept the notion that time is merely a function of our “blurred” human perception. We see the world only through a glass, darkly we are watching Plato’s shadow-play in the cave. According to Rovelli, our undeniable experience of time is inextricably linked to the way heat behaves. In The Order of Time, he asks why can we know only the past, and not the future? The key, he suggests, is the one-directional flow of heat from warmer objects to colder ones. An ice cube dropped into a hot cup of coffee cools the coffee. But the process is not reversible: it is a one-way street, as demonstrated by the second law of thermodynamics.Time is also, as we experience it, a one-way street. He explains it in relation to the concept of entropy – the measure of the disordering of things. Entropy was lower in the past. Entropy is higher in the future – there is more disorder, there are more possibilities. The pack of cards of the future is shuffled and uncertain, unlike the ordered and neatly arranged pack of cards of the past. But entropy, heat, past and future are qualities that belong not to the fundamental grammar of the world but to our superficial observation of it. “If I observe the microscopic state of things,” writes Rovelli, “then the difference between past and future vanishes … in the elementary grammar of things, there is no distinction between ‘cause’ and ‘effect’.”To understand this properly, I can suggest only that you read Rovelli’s books, and pass swiftly over this approximation by someone who gave up school physics lessons joyfully at the first possible opportunity. However, it turns out that I am precisely Rovelli’s perfect reader, or one of them, and he looks quite delighted when I check my newly acquired understanding of the concept of entropy with him. (“You passed the exam,” he says.)“I try to write at several levels,” he explains. “I think about the person who not only doesn’t know anything about physics but is also not interested. So I think I am talking to my grandmother, who was a housekeeper. I also think some young students of physics are reading it, and I also think some of my colleagues are reading it. So I try to talk at different levels, but I keep the person who knows nothing in my mind.”His biggest fans are the blank slates, like me, and his colleagues at universities – he gets most criticism from people in the middle, “those who know a bit of physics”. He is also pretty down on school physics. (“Calculating the speed at which a ball drops – who cares? In another life, I’d like to write a school physics book,” he says.) And he thinks the ision of the world into the “two cultures” of natural sciences and human sciences is “stupid. It’s like taking England and iding the kids into groups, and you tell one group about music, and one group about literature, and the one who gets music is not allowed to read novels and the one who does literature is not allowed to listen to music.”The joy of his writing is its broad cultural compass. Historicism gives an initial hand-hold on the material. (He teaches a course on history of science, where he likes to bring science and humanities students together.) And then there’s the fact that alongside Einstein, Ludwig Boltzmann and Roger Penrose appear figures such as Proust, Dante, Beethoven, and, especially, Horace – each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Roman poet – as if to ground us in human sentiment and emotion before departing for the vertiginous world of black holes and spinfoam and clouds of probabilities.“He has a side that is intimate, lyrical and extremely intense and he is the great singer of the passing of time,” Rovelli says. “There’s a feeling of nostalgia – it’s not anguish, it’s not sorrow – it’s a feeling of ‘Let’s live life intensely’. A good friend of mine, Ernesto, who died quite young, gave me a little book of Horace, and I have carried it around with me all my life.”Rovelli’s view is that there is no contradiction between a vision of the universe that makes human life seem small and irrelevant, and our everyday sorrows and joys. Or indeed between “cold science” and our inner, spiritual lives. “We are part of nature, and so joy and sorrow are aspects of nature itself – nature is much richer than just sets of atoms,” he tells me. There’s a moment in Seven Lessons when he compares physics and poetry: both try to describe the unseen. It might be added that physics, when departing from its native language of mathematical equations, relies strongly on metaphor and analogy. Rovelli has a gift for memorable comparisons. He tells us, for example, when explaining that the smooth “flow” of time is an illusion, that “The events of the world do not form an orderly queue like the English, they crowd around chaotically like the Italians.” The concept of time, he says, “has lost layers one after another, piece by piece”. We are left with “an empty windswept landscape almost devoid of all trace of temporality … a world stripped to its essence, glittering with an arid and troubling beauty”.More than anything else I’ve ever read, Rovelli reminds me of Lucretius, the first-century BCE Roman author of the epic-length poem, On the Nature of Things. Perhaps not so odd, since Rovelli is a fan. Lucretius correctly hypothesised the existence of atoms, a theory that would remain unproven until Einstein demonstrated it in 1905, and even as late as the 1890s was being written off as absurd. What Rovelli shares with Lucretius is not only a brilliance of language, but also a sense of humankind’s place in nature – at once a part of the fabric of the universe, and in a particular position to marvel at its great beauty. It’s a rationalist view: one that holds that by better understanding the universe, by discarding false beliefs and superstition, one might be able to enjoy a kind of serenity. Though Rovelli the man also acknowledges that the stuff of humanity is love, and fear, and desire, and passion: all made meaningful by our brief lives our tiny  of allotted time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2afd16cf7250b0071365f9d9b07b43b91416cf/0_50_941_565/master/941.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=decb86d81ebb140a2dec89036b3af1c1 1240w","title":"census jesse ball review downs syndrome novel human empathy","story":"A father and his son with Down’s syndrome go on a road trip in this remarkable novel about the nature of empathyTwo very different literary impulses collide in Jesse Ball’s new novel: old-fashioned memoir and modernist fable. One might think they were incompatible, given their allegiances to the separate truths of experience and imagination, but it’s a testament to the skill of this talented writer (on the Granta best young American novelists list in 2017) that they end up enhancing each other in all kinds of unexpected, often remarkable ways.An opening note states the author’s intention to write about his brother, Abram Ball, who had Down’s syndrome, and whose life (he died aged 24) was “something so tremendous, so full of light, that I\u0026nbspthought I must write a book that helps people to see what it is like to know and love a Down’s syndrome boy or girl”. Family photos at the end imply that this is not some metafictional gambit.The same note explains an authorial decision that, since Ball grew up thinking of himself as a caretaker figure to his brother, he will recast the fraternal relationship as one of father and son. It seems a\u0026nbspmodest change, promising a judicious measure of artfulness while suggesting the story isn’t going to stray far from reality, much less from realism itself.So it’s a surprise to find oneself, a few pages later, plunged into a high-concept fable about a dying census taker and his son driving through a country as surreally like and unlike America as the land of Kafka’s Amerika, on a mission that has more in common with the metaphysical investigations of Beckett’s tramps and Rilke’s angels than anything you’d find under “What we do” on the US Census Bureau’s website.As with anything original, Census takes getting used to. It’s written very idiosyncratically. Unlike the austere verbal neutrality of the Kafka stories it otherwise resembles, it cultivates a folksy, whimsical style that can cloy. Some phrasing sounds like pastiche Thoreau: “I\u0026nbsphave often triedto look through the eyes of those who find in the most familiar things an endless reverie.” And you’d have to have a very sweet tooth to enjoy some of the loftier rhetorical moments: “Is there none who can simply wander alone beneath a sort of cloth tent painted with dreams?”I’m not sure the voice ever won me over entirely, but I found myself able to accept it, or ignore it, as I\u0026nbspgot absorbed in the story’s larger inventions. There’s the initially perplexing but (as it turns out) precisely imagined matter of what it means to be a “census taker” in this universe. Not to give too much away, we come to understand it as a kind of redemptive and transformative witnessing of people’s lives. Underlying it is the Socratic dictum about the unexamined life not being worth living, along with the scriptural idea of the recording angel who notes our every thought and deed.It sounds a bit solemn, perhaps, but it’s done with a light touch and a resourceful sense of drama. And there’s the basic fascination of the interviewees. Like any good road novel, Census is at one level a gallery of quickly sketched encounters, and among the book’s pleasures are the characters who open their doors to this itinerant father and son. There’s a sinister detective, a thumbless doctor at a fantastical rope factory, a hipster puzzle maker, an alarming nymphomaniac and her even more alarming sister. There are figures who seem to have stepped from a Wes Anderson movie, a\u0026nbspTolkien novel, a Bruno Schultz short story and Greil Marcus’s “old, weird America”. They’re all vividly rendered, often with wonderfully macabre or bizarre stories in their background, and advance a\u0026nbspsustained philosophical inquiry into the nature and limits of human empathy, specifically in the way they relate to the son.It’s with the son that the element of lived experience enters the story most poignantly. Vignettes that crystallise the boy’s touching (often very funny) way of looking at things crop up as scenes or memories throughout the book, adding the tang of observed reality to its more speculative qualities. Here are the father and son approaching a\u0026nbsphouse: “I wanted to pass it by, but my son insisted. Why did he insist? I think it was because there was a\u0026nbspround window in the face of the house.” And here they are after the son has had a turn at the wheel: “He\u0026nbspsaid this after driving the car: now I am a driver. I\u0026nbspsaid, yes, but don’t drive the car without me. He said you don’t drive the car without me.”You don’t have to have any particular interest in Down’s syndrome to connect with this aspect of the book: it isn’t a polemic about special needs, but a detailed and moving portrayal of a kind of radical innocence, one that brings both the cruelty and the kindness in the world around it into sharp focus. For me, it was the most powerful of the many surprises in this unusual, impressive novel.• James Lasdun’s The Fall Guy is published by Vintage. Census\u0026nbspis published by Granta.

In a row which brings together sexism, money and privilege, along with levels of spite that would shame a kindergarten, three of the 18 members stepped down last week, in protest because they lost a vote to exclude a fourth member, Katarina Frostenson, a poet whose husband stands accused of 18 separate instances of sexual harassment, including rape.By Thursday night, the resulting public scandal had led to departures of both Frostenson and the permanent secretary Sara Danius – who had been among her accusers – after they were forced out after a three hour meeting.Public feuding among the normally secretive members of the Academy has reached an unprecedented pitch. One member, writer and journalist Per Wästberg, described Thursday’s deal in a newspaper piece as “compromised horse trading which sacrificed two women, one against the other. It is a stain on the Academy’s reputation which cannot be cleaned off – and all this because of a sexual predator!”The obvious answer would be mass resignations and starting again. But it turns out that you cannot resign from the Academy itself. The statutes, laid down in 1786, make no provision for it. Members are elected until death. All disaffected members can do is to withdraw from the Academy’s workings. After this week’s withdrawals there is no longer a quorum needed to elect any new members. King Carl Gustav XVI, the hereditary patron of the Academy, is reported to be preparing a change of the statutes to break the deadlock.The Academy is a self-perpetuating oligarchy of 18 members, rich, prestigious (at least in its own eyes) and secretive, which has awarded the Nobel Prize in literature since its foundation in 1901 (other prizes are awarded by different bodies the peace prize, for example, by the Norwegian parliament). The first woman member was the Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf, who, since she had won the prize, could hardly be excluded. But it remains, by all accounts, a very male-dominated place.But last autumn, in the wake of the Weinstein scandal in Hollywood, 18 separate women came forward to Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter with accusations against Arnault, who denies all of them. Since then, he has also been accused of leaking the names of seven separate prize winners ahead of the award although two Swedish bookmakers claim to have found no evidence of funny betting, in one case Ladbrokes in England suspended betting after a huge rush of money onto the eventual winner.Because of the convention in the Swedish press that criminals and suspects not be named, the scandal was able to proceed for some months without fully breaking out. At the same time, there were other tensions within the Academy, arising from the appointment of Sara Danius as the first woman permanent secretary (despite the title, this is a role that is held for a limited term). She is a forceful woman, who was attempting a modernisation programme that seems to have been resisted by two of her predecessors: historian and essayist Horace Engdahl, and the 89-year-old Sture Allen, who was permanent secretary in 1989, the year two members withdrew because the Academy would not publicly support of Salman Rushdie in the aftermath of The Satanic Verses controversy.Danius, an essayist and literary critic, told interviewers that over the summer she made use in committee meetings of her alter-ego, “Gittan P. Jonsson”: a fierce woman from the far south of the country “with lacquered hair and Margaret Thatcher’s handbag”, who speaks in a thick, almost Danish accent and bulldozes men around.This did not go down at all well with men like Engdahl and Allen, who, for decades had been used to bulldozing around themselves. (Engdahl physically shoved a woman reporter out of his way when entering Thursday’s decisive meeting where Danius and Frostenson were metaphorically pushed out.)The conservative faction, led by Engdahl, had defended their refusal to expel Frostenson on the grounds that it was unfair to punish a woman for the allegedcrimes of her husband also that it was unfair to punish only one member of the Academy when the decision to subsidise Arnault’s club had been made by the whole membership. But last Sunday, in a newspaper article laying out his defence, Engdahl went on to call Danius the worst permanent secretary in the entire history of the Academy.This provoked a ferocious backlash. Writer and journalist Sofia Mirjamsdotter wrote: “On the surface the struggle in the Academy is about leaks and conflicts of interest. In fact it is about confused men who suddenly see the playing filed shift under their feet that they can no longer get away with it that overreaching and the abuse of power can be punished and that women rise up and say ‘enough’ and that they won’t back down even when men try to shut them up.”The collapse of this self-important bulwark of patriarchy and privilege is not over yet. One member of the Academy said that he had decided on the expulsion of both Danius and Frostenson after conversations with the King, who is the Academy’s patron. In yet another unprecedented move, the King has issued a statement saying that it wasn’t his idea and he does not approve of it. Meanwhile, the writer Klas Östergren, one of those who left their chair in protest at the first refusal to exclude Frostenson, has now applied formally to be allowed to resign. That must end up in the hands of the lawyers. Now the Academy, which once stood for the summit of western literary culture, now stands as an illustration of Grouch Marx’s great wisecrack: who would want to be a member of the club that has members like this?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a23ba403709b21e248cb167b6147b67bca03b9/0_252_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=4750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ffcff317820ddb889c1414c5bebeecc 9500w","title":"best world love letter australia public pools sydney swimming","story":"Tracing his conversion from pool refusnik to aquatic evangelist,  Benjamin Law asks: is swimming the Australian version of baptism?Tracing his conversion from pool refusnik to aquatic evangelist,  Benjamin Law asks: is swimming the Australian version of baptism?In Australia, you’re expected to just know how to swim. It makes sense: more than four in five Australians live within easy walking or driving distance of the sea. As writer Anna Funder recently said of those who call the driest continent on Earth home: “We cling to the edge of the continent, and we swim from a very early age.”Growing up, I hated swimming – which was awful, because I didn’t just grow up in Australia, I grew up in Queensland: the sun-saturated state that gifted us Olympic gods like Kieran Perkins, Susie O’Neill, Grant Hackett and Stephanie Rice, a state where the main trade seemed to be sugar, coal and championship swimmers.You weren’t just expected to know how to swim you were expected to be good at it, too.My parents were Cantonese migrants from Hong Kong who, in the 1970s, moved to Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, home to some of the country’s most beautiful beaches. It still strikes me as a slightly baffling decision, given neither of them could swim. Water compelled and terrified them and their five Australian-born kids.While other people saw stunning coastlines, we just saw a picturesque way to die. Rips could kill you, people said. Sharks could kill you. Skin cancer could kill you. Weirdly, it was always white people who told us these things, the same white people who seemed to keep going to the beach. Were we missing something? Did they want to die?A safer option was the public pool. Years of TV safety campaigns had convinced Mum we needed to know how to swim, because she sure as hell couldn’t save us if we were drowning. Throughout summer, we’d wail as Mum drove us to the nearest suburban leisure centre for lessons. I suspect we dreaded those lessons as much as our instructors dreaded teaching us, those hopeless Asian kids spluttering with anxiety inside the enclosed training pool, those stinking hothouses of chemicals, piss and wet togs (or cossies, or bathers, or swimmers – depending on your state).After the nightmare was over, we’d be sedated with a treat – a Redskin (Australians veer towards racism even with our confectionary), an ice block or a packet of frogs – before falling asleep in the stuffy Ford Cortina, hair matted to our temples, seat belts twisted into our skin and fingers dusted orange from the Twisties we stole from each other.The horror didn’t end there. At school, not only were swimming lessons mandatory, carnivals were too – annual, school-run swim meets, ostensibly fun but deeply competitive. We even had togs in school colours that we had to buy from the uniform shop.During the lessons, I’d watch fit white kids e in and carve through water with graceful limbs that seemed custom-built for the job. Meanwhile, in Lane 1 or 6 – where I could still hold onto the wall – I’d windmill uselessly, my hands banging into the water like saucepans. There was a direct, inverse correlation between the amount of splashing I made and the distance I travelled. At swimming carnivals, all the outcasts were bunched together: the ethnic kid with no body fat (me) pale kids with lots of body fat. We had to swim in an event – any event – so we’d do the novelty race, paddling together on inflatable rafts, damp with chlorine and shame, as everyone cheered and jeered us on. But then, weirdly, I fell in love with swimming. I left home for university, moved to Brisbane and into a rambling architectural mess of a shared house. Its design was … incorrect. It attracted the heat in summer, then trapped it. During heatwaves, my flatmates and I would emerge from our rooms having barely slept and looking boiled. I took refuge from the heat at the Olympic-sized council pool at the bottom of our hill. It didn’t look like much from the outside, but inside it was pure and clean, with a panoramic view of the city skyline. I didn’t have proper togs so I swam in black boxer briefs, hoping no one would notice. After a while, I tried swimming laps.Guardian Cities is dedicating a week to exploring the opportunities and challenges of Australia\u0027s rapidly growing cities. The nation of nearly 25 million has one of the fastest-rising populations of all OECD countries, overwhelmingly focused on its biggest cities: Sydney and Melbourne. But with car dependence, urban sprawl and unaffordable housing threatening their famed liveability, are they ready for the challenge? Canberra, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart, Darwin and Brisbane face similar issues, while nationwide, poor indigenous consultation is a growing urban issue. Australian Cities Week, a collaboration with Guardian Australia, seeks to reveal and celebrate the culture, architecture, wildlife and character that bolster these cities\u0027 reputations as unique and desirable places to live.Alan, the pool manager, took pity on me. “Instead of bashing into the water with your arms like that,” he said, “stretch out like this and twist your entire torso. Instead of exhaling like that, hum and you won’t lose your breath so quickly.” It was homework, and I’d always liked homework. Slowly, I got faster.By the time I moved to Sydney, I owned proper Speedos, goggles and a kickboard. I signed myself up for a 1km charity ocean swim. From some angles it seemed as though I had pecs. Who was this person?I’ve been helped by the fact Sydney has – hands down – the best lap pools in the world. Every inner-city public pool is a wonder in some way. My local, the Prince Alfred Park Pool, is an award-winning architectural miracle built into a hill – like a swimming oasis for hobbits. It’s impossible to take a bad photo of North Sydney Olympic Pool, where the reward for finishing laps is endless Instagram-ready photos of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which towers above the pool like a CGI hallucination. On the other side of the harbour, Andrew “Boy” Charlton Pool is plonked right in the middle of the botanical gardens, decked out like a resort and boasting so many toned men in Speedos, it feels like you’re in the video for Kylie Minogue’s Slow.Even Sydney’s indoor pools – which I usually avoid because of the claustrophobic chlorine pong – are impressive. Ultimo’s dreamy, wave-walled Ian Thorpe Aquatic Centre (the first Sydney pool I ever swam in) is a Harry Seidler original, a modernist wave of concrete and steel rising from Darling Harbour. In the Cook + Phillip Park Aquatic and Fitness Centre are giant paintings by the Archibald winner Wendy Sharpe, making it one of the few places where you can do laps in an art gallery.For a spiritual experience, it’s all about the ocean baths. On good days, you can swim alongside schools of fish in Wylie’s Baths in Coogee. There’s a reason people rave about Bondi Icebergs, with its sauna overlooking the violent churn of the surf below. And though I’ll never get to visit, I love the idea of Coogee’s McIver’s Ladies Baths, the last remaining women’s-only seawater pool in Australia. Apparently it’s particularly popular with nuns, Muslim women and lesbians I like thinking about the unexpected friendships that have been made there.Is it too far to say swimming is the Australian version of baptism? To me, these places feel sacred to swim in them veers towards sacrament. When I get writer’s block, I swim. When I need space, I swim. When I need company, I swim. When I’m depressed, I swim. When I’m happy, I swim.Last Christmas, my siblings and I – all comically terrible swimmers as kids – laughed at the fact that our eldest sister was now a regular surfer. The remaining four of us now swim regularly in lap pools. Those Asian kids at school, so bad at swimming carnivals that they were constantly disqualified? Well, some of them grew up and now swim  kilometres for leisure. It shouldn’t be surprising – we’re also Australian, after all.In collaboration with Guardian Australia, Guardian Cities is devoting a week to Australian cities.

Until three days ago, making that statement could have landed me in prison. Before Thursday, it was a crime for adults of the same gender to have sex. Our “buggery” law imposed 25 years’ imprisonment. All other intimacy between two women or two men risked five years’ imprisonment under the demeaningly named offence of “serious indecency”.Last year I said enough is enough and sued my country to change the law. My legal team, led by Richard Drabble QC, argued that these laws violate the right to privacy, family life, equality before the law and freedom of expression.On Thursday we won the case – and resoundingly so. Mr Justice Rampersad in the high court of Port of Spain, our capital, handed down judgment agreeing that each of these rights was violated. On a rough count, there are about 100,000 LGBTQ+ people in Trinidad and Tobago. Finally, each of us is free from the fear of arrest, prosecution and imprisonment simply for living our lives.Listening to the judgment, I broke down in tears as I realised that I had won, that my country – for the first time – had accepted me for who I am. I can’t describe how it feels to hear a judge say that as a gay man I have an inherent human dignity with which the state must not interfere. His firmness on this point was commendable – laws that criminalise homosexuality, he ruled, are as heinous as those that allowed apartheid, segregation and the Holocaust. I agree.The judge recognised that when human dignity is stripped away, so as to render one characteristic “superior” to another, society goes awry. After the judgment, as I stood outside the Hall of Justice wrapped in a rainbow flag, I had finally been clothed in dignity.This judgment was the culmination of my 30 years of human rights’ activism. I was born in the 1960s, the decade that Trinidad and Tobago gained independence from Britain. Like other former colonies, we inherited Britain’s anti-gay laws. But our Spanish, French and Dutch-speaking neighbours do not criminalise homosexuality, and never did.As a teenager, it was obvious to others that I was gay. The bullying was incessant and cruel. In the 1980s I left Trinidad for London, unable to cope with the daily homophobia. In 1992 I returned home but the persecution had not changed. In 1996 I was forced away again. I came back between 2011 and 2014 to try to progress this issue through engagement and advocacy but the homophobia remained intolerable. In the end, this saga of suffering won me my case. My having to leave – effectively forced into exile – was submitted as evidence to the court of how vile these laws are.Litigation was a last resort for me, so that I could return home. That is all I have ever wanted to do. It has been the most humbling of experiences, with challenges that I could not have imagined. The religious groups who supported the retention of the laws were polite opponents, as much as we disagreed. The shock to me was that those who should most support decriminalisation most disrupted my challenge. My only support from any NGO – in Trinidad, the UK or internationally – was some funding from an HIV-prevention charity.In December 2015 I approached the Human Dignity Trust, a London-based charity whose sole purpose is to bring about the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It said it would help. I was overjoyed, but then it dropped me without explanation, blocking my remaining routes to funding in the process. Just as upsetting was how my country’s Equal Opportunity Commission (EOC) reacted to my challenge. It submitted a document to court supporting the retention of the criminal laws. At that stage, I almost gave up.I ran my case on a shoestring of around £20,000 over two-and-a-half years. That’s a mere 20p per LGBTQ+ person no longer a criminal. I now hope that my lean model becomes the norm, whereby activists are in control, unbeholden to global organisations that often only profit from our suffering.It was only the support of my legal team that kept me going – Rishi Dass and Antonio Emmanuel in Trinidad, and Peter Laverack in London, who in particular has been my rock, and was the architect of the legal arguments that won the day.At the EOC, it turned out that a junior member of staff submitted the document without authority. The day before the trial, thankfully, it was withdrawn.After the many bumps in the road, it was the rule of law that prevailed. For that, all Trinbagonians can rejoice. My dignity is their dignity is our dignity. The words of my country’s national anthem say that its citizens of every kind “find an equal place”. Now, finally, I have.With the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting taking place in London from Monday, I am hopeful that our victory offers pause to the 36 of 53 Commonwealth countries that still criminalise homosexuality. Nine are in the Caribbean.The right to dignity that Trinidad and Tobago’s court recognised in me is universal – in lesbians criminalised in Uganda and Tanzania, and in gay men criminalised in India and Singapore.It is imperative that LGBTQ+ is on the agenda in London. The event offers both a safe space for this discussion and an opportunity for the capital of the former empire that bequeathed us these heinous laws to help rid us of them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c20108c284dcb186f1b10457a289aa3705b6e84b/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f44ad441bdc275d22a69ec0c3de24616 1240w","title":"schools education pupils families home","story":"TV shows recognise how vital home input is to education. So why doesn’t the government do more to support families?This is a tale of two boys. Jack is 15, casually racking up detentions and in danger of flunking his GCSEs. Tharush is the same age, but sits conscientiously doing extra maths on a Friday night while his classmates are out partying. But it’s also, at least in part, a tale of two parenting styles. Jack’s mum seems lovely but works long hours, and can’t face a long row over the homework he doesn’t do when she gets home. Tharush’s mum escaped civil war in Sri Lanka by stowing away in a container for 18 hours, afraid she would die, and is now determined her boy should make the most of chances she didn’t have. For BBC2’s fly-on-the-wall experiment, Living with the Brainy Bunch, Jack moved in with Tharush’s stricter parents while his equally disengaged classmate Hollie M went to live with the school’s head girl and her family, who enjoy challenging each other to name Shakespeare plays over supper.Spoiler alert: after six weeks of early bedtimes, beadily supervised homework and other wholesome activities, both guinea pigs’ scores on a maths GCSE paper improved. Bonus question, for an extra five marks: discuss what, if anything, that proves.Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn’t meant to prove anything but merely to dramatise what decades of rather more rigorous research shows, namely the extraordinarily powerful influence of parental involvement on children’s attainment. It’s debatable how much is nature or nurture, and which precise bits of parenting make a difference. But there’s a broad consensus around the usefulness of things such as reading to small children, setting routines and boundaries, ensuring teenagers get enough sleep, eating dinner together, and showing you take schoolwork seriously.Obviously, that’s infinitely easier if a parent’s own life is comfortable and unstressed you try emulating the Waltons while simultaneously being evicted from a rented flat, or hiding from a violent ex, or even being too exhausted by your newborn to prise the iPad from its older sibling’s hands.But beyond the extremes are plenty of children like Jack and Hollie who aren’t traumatised or on the breadline but hover on the borderline of a GCSE pass or fail, and could be doing better. That’s the territory explored by a new wave of education telly that also includes Channel 4’s Class of Mum and Dad – about a group of parents sent back to primary school – and Indian Summer School, following five struggling British boys packed off to a strict overseas boarding school. All three are a reminder that home environments, and what they mean for expectations of schools, are curiously under-discussed.On the right of politics, any suggestion that teachers can’t be expected both to teach and simultaneously compensate for anything missing at home is rejected as the bigotry of soft expectations. Liberals meanwhile worry about sounding judgmental or snobby, even though self-indulgent parenting transcends class ides: think of the pushy private school parent who can’t believe their little darling’s D-grade might be his own fault for not revising, and blames the teachers instead of pondering his work ethic.But talk to teachers, and you hear about the endless time spent parenting the parents, never mind the kids: breaking up fights between grown adults in the playground, explaining that it’s probably best not to let kids stay up till 3am playing Xbox or instantly take their side in every dispute. We are expecting schools to solve problems created at home while simultaneously cutting the very things – from early intervention projects to children’s mental health services – that might help. If politicians want educational standards to keep rising inexorably that means investing in family life, too.State intervention in parenting has an admittedly chequered history. Sure Start is the standout example of focusing on children’s early development while tacitly recognising how much of that flows from helping parents parent but in some neighbourhoods it was colonised by parents who didn’t need it, and results could be patchy. David Cameron’s troubled families programme was overhyped, underfunded and presented unnecessarily confrontationally by politicians as punishment for “bad” parents, although on the ground it did some decent work in places. The longer school days introduced by inner-city academies, so pupils could do homework in school supervised by teachers, were a practical recognition that for some school is the only relatively quiet, safe place they know, but there’s a limit to how long they can be on the premises.There’s no silver bullet. In some cases it will be about lifting financial stress on families, in others about changing behaviour – including supporting those parents who are doing their best who desperately want to help their kids, but struggle with the legacy of their own schooldays. Class of Mum and Dad was full of them, from the dad who kicked instantly against the rules to the woman who fled a maths test designed for 11-year-olds in tears because she couldn’t do it, and turned out to have been bullied as a child. It left you wondering why routes back into adult education aren’t better linked with schools when wanting to be able to help with your own child’s homework is such a powerful motivator. Could schools become gateways to lifelong learning, offering refresher sessions after hours to parents unfamiliar with the bus-stop method for ision (ask an eight-year-old) or even night classes leading to qualifications?The surprisingly good-natured exchanges between Jack and Hollie’s parents and their host families, and the friendships forged between the kids, hint meanwhile at the importance of peer mentoring. Advice is easier to swallow from someone in the same boat than from an official lecture.But the final step in other cases is parents ourselves taking responsibility for what we do or don’t do: recognising that schools can’t work miracles, that blaming teachers for things beyond their control is unfair and demoralising. It’s time this debate moved off the telly and into real life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a09b7e20b1f8199ca8594d62834d6468 1240w","title":"uk university strike action to end after staff vote to accept offer","story":"Ballot finds significant majority in favour of accepting offer to reopen talks over pensionsThe strike action that hit 65 universities across the UK this year is on hold after staff voted to accept an offer to reopen negotiations with employers over their pensions.The ballot of 50,000 University and College Union members in higher education found a substantial majority in favour of accepting the offer, which establishes a joint committee of experts to evaluate pensions provided through the University Superannuation Scheme (USS).There was a high turnout of nearly two-thirds of eligible members, with more than 21,000 voting to accept the offer from Universities UK, and 12,000 voting to reject it. A further wave of strikes due to begin next week has been suspended.Fourteen days of teaching were lost to strikes on 65 campuses last term, with fears that further action in summer would disrupt final examinations and mean that students on some courses might be unable to graduate.The strike centred on a radical overhaul of the USS – the country’s largest private sector pension scheme with 400,000 members at 67 universities and colleges, as well as 300 specialist institutions such as the Royal Society and Cancer Research UK. Staff anger was triggered by a decision in January in favour of the employers that would have ended the scheme’s defined benefits – guaranteed levels of payment to members upon retirement.Instead, the fixed benefits would be replaced by defined contributions, in which members would pay in but their eventual pension payments would be dictated by their level of payment and the state of financial markets at retirement.Sally Hunt, the UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.“We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.”Universities UK said the decision to appoint an expert panel and suspend industrial action would reassure students that their exams would not be affected. “It is important that interested parties engage with the panel and remain open-minded about its possible findings,” a UUK spokesperson said.“Working in partnership with UCU, we will now appoint a jointly agreed chair for the panel as soon as possible before developing its terms of reference, order of work and timescales.”The Office for Students – the universities regulator in England – has told universities to make clear to students what impact the industrial action had and how any related disruption will be handled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207ad3dbdd62fc5a379f11694f50ff015aec128d/0_340_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=136e1f162576299b3835c385915ec99a 2600w","title":"eyes throat burning what caused birling gap toxic cloud","story":"Last August, holidaymakers in East Sussex fell ill after a poisonous yellow cloud spread across the sky. What was it, and where did it come from?Mark Sawyer has worked for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution for nearly 30 years, and since 2001 he’s been the full-time coxswain at the Eastbourne lifeboat station. Shortly after 5pm on the Sunday of a bank holiday weekend last August, he received a report from the coastguard in Southampton about an incident at a beach seven miles west of his station. “The call we got was that there had either been a fire or an explosion at Birling Gap, and they’d got 50-plus casualties suffering from smoke inhalation or burns.” There was what looked like a layer of thick smoke hanging just above the sea.Birling Gap is a popular National Trust spot between Beachy Head and Seaford, a dip in the chalk cliffs of the Seven Sisters, with a steel staircase leading down to a pebble beach. At low tide there is sand and rockpools on the cliffs above there is a visitor centre, cafe, car park and coastguard station.By 6pm that Sunday, the beach had been evacuated and a major incident declared, and Eastbourne district general hospital was carrying out one of the biggest mass decontaminations in NHS history.The gas or vapour appeared to come rolling along the shore from the east. “We could see this yellowy haze in the air,” a member of the Eastbourne coastguard team says. “It was almost like the film The Fog.” (The fog of John Carpenter’s 1980 horror brings with it the malevolent ghosts of drowned sailors.) Others describe it as clear, or blueish, or sandy. In the frenetic smartphone footage from the scene it looks like a vapour, with a yellow tint, though this might be an effect of the low, late-afternoon sun. It was reported variously as having an odour of chlorine, ammonia and burning plastic. Others say it had no odour, but more of a taste, a chemical astringency in the throat. “We’ve got the water-treatment works near the harbour,” Sawyer says, “but that’s a different smell, I can assure you. The fishermen used to say if the wind’s in the right direction, you can smell your way back to Eastbourne.” A taxi driver who had been nearby at the time says with disarming certainty that it smelled of “potash and corpses”.Meanwhile, Sawyer and his RNLI colleagues were approaching Birling Gap from the east, in their lifeboat Diamond Jubilee. It had been an exceptionally busy 24 hours for the station, even by the standards of a hot bank holiday weekend. Just after midnight a car had been driven over Beachy Head, close to Birling Gap, and the RNLI had spent the morning at the scene. Around 11am, having been up much of the night, the crew was called to recover a body that had been spotted by a fishing boat. That afternoon they also undertook one of the RNLI’s lesser-known roles, the scattering of ashes at sea. They were flagging when the call came in about Birling Gap.“As we were leaving, the coastguard told us they were getting unconfirmed reports that people were suffering from the effects of a poisonous gas,” Sawyer says, as we sit in his office overlooking Eastbourne’s Sovereign Harbour. “As we went towards the west we could see this haze, and all of a sudden our eyes started to burn and you could feel the back of your throat burning. We were told in no uncertain terms, ‘Get into the wheelhouse and shut the doors.’”It took a while for Laura Knight, a drama therapist from Brighton, to realise anything was wrong. She had been on the beach since about 2pm, with her partner and two children, aged six and nine. They were planning a barbecue. “The height of the tide at that time meant the beach was quite thin, and everybody was crammed on the shingle. We had a little swim, everyone was enjoying the sun, and then we started noticing that people were coughing and their eyes were streaming.” It resembled a dense, morning sea mist, she says. “It started slowly to come in, then you lost sight of the cliffs.”Later that afternoon, Eastbourne’s Liberal Democrat MP, Stephen Lloyd, was at Cork airport in Ireland, waiting for a flight home after a weekend break, when texts started coming in about the haze. “So I make some calls and I learn a ‘poisonous gas cloud’ has materialised at Birling Gap,” he says. “I thought, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ With all the fear around terrorism, you just don’t know. I spoke to someone at the hospital and they said, ‘People are coming in we don’t know what it is.’ They were scrabbling around in the dark.”Sussex police, who coordinated the response on land, received the first call about the event at 5.08pm. It came not from a member of the public but from an officer who had been given the information by the RNLI. As the makeup of the cloud was unknown, and reports of symptoms were coming in from a wide area, a forward control point was set up just over a mile from Birling Gap, at the Beachy Head car park. Police, firefighters, ambulance crews and the coastguard convened. Within an hour the police had released a statement advising residents in the area to stay inside, with doors and windows closed. By 5.30pm, the coastguard and RNLI had started evacuating three miles of coastline between Birling Gap and Eastbourne.“By this time a lot of people had left the beach,” Knight remembers. “Then we saw the fire brigade arrive with full protective gear on – head to toe in masks, goggles – and everyone else was semi-naked. I started to really cough, I could feel it in my chest. My eyes were burning. Then of course the anxiety gets you. The children started seeing police officers and my son was really concerned about the animals, the sheep. He was saying, ‘What’s going to happen to all the farm animals, Mummy, is someone going to move them?’ Had it hit a busy beach like Brighton, it would have been a major, major incident.”At 6pm patients started arriving at Eastbourne hospital, not only from Birling Gap but also from the wider Eastbourne area. They were complaining of streaming eyes, coughing and sore throats there had also been reports of vomiting. “We work on a 1-2-3 rule,” says chief operating officer Joe Chadwick-Bell. “If the first patient comes along: interesting. If somebody else comes along, you think something’s going on. If a third person comes along, it’s not a coincidence.” As more patients started to arrive, the A\u0026ampE department declared a major incident.A report published in January by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that the fire service deployed mobile gas detectors calibrated to locate carbon monoxide, oxygen, flammable gas and hydrogen sulphide – chemicals they might expect to encounter in the course of their more regular callouts. Only a very low reading was recorded for flammable gas and a single reading for ammonia at a level too low to be registered by humans. Furthermore, a police tactical adviser specialising in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats was called in to test the air, but again found nothing of concern. No samples were taken by any agency.As dusk fell, a queue had formed at the hospital, as patients were assessed by medics in fluorescent green hazmat suits and processed through a decontamination tent set up outside A\u0026ampE. At one point more than 80 people were queueing. Patients arrived throughout the night and into the next morning. On the advice of the National Poisons Information Service, 108 were showered, their clothes placed in a plastic bag, and issued with a hospital gown and slippers before proceeding to A\u0026ampE. Consultant Dr Zeki Atesli was on call that day. “The most common complaint was red eyes,” he says. “The poisons unit mentioned ammonia, but I didn’t smell any gas. We didn’t know what we were dealing with. One patient with acute exacerbation of asthma we took into resus as a precaution another gentleman in his 70s with a history of angina developed chest pain. One girl collapsed in my arms from the anxiety. But no one was pushing or screaming. English people are very nice. They stay in the queue.”“You could taste it,” Chadwick-Bell says. “It was an acidy-type taste.” Hearing that the cloud was moving west, she contacted Eastbourne’s sister hospital at St Leonards-on-Sea in Hastings, 14 miles along the coast, which was put on alert for a major incident. “They had their tent out and they were ready to go.” Although only a few patients turned up in Hastings, the cloud had spread far beyond Birling Gap. Just over half a mile inland, people drinking in the garden of the Tiger Inn in East Dean were advised by police to evacuate, while sore throats and stinging eyes were experienced at a beer festival in Litlington, three miles north-west of Birling Gap. Tony Fitch, who has been fishing in the area for 65 years, spent the day on the beach at Pevensey Bay, nine miles east. He remembers a mist and a sea breeze from the south-east, and while he noticed nothing amiss at the time, the next morning he had a sore throat and sore eyes, symptoms he says have lingered to this day.Eastbourne’s new town slogan, launched in the summer of 2016, caused a stir: “Breathe It In” is a brave choice for a town recently ranked as one of Britain’s worst for air quality. Dr Gary Fuller of King’s College London, an expert in air pollution, works with the Sussex Air Quality Partnership, an organisation promoting better air quality in the county. He explains that two fixed monitors registered unusually high spikes of ozone late in the afternoon on 27 August, at around the time of the haze. “The peaks were exceptional,” he says. “This wasn’t just something confined to the beach at Birling Gap it was covering a far wider area.” A monitor at Lullington Heath, five miles inland, and another in Eastbourne both recorded a rapid rise in the gas on the same afternoon. The abruptness of the peaks was unusual, however, and it’s possible the monitors were responding to another substance: chlorine, for instance, can affect ozone readings. “It didn’t behave as we would expect ozone to behave,” Fuller says.While no one appeared to have been made seriously ill, dozens of Stephen Lloyd’s constituents, who hours earlier had been sunbathing, found themselves standing naked in a decontamination shower. No one knows how many more experienced symptoms, but tens of thousands were advised to close their doors and windows and stay inside. Lloyd began pressing the agencies for information.“At the back of my mind I was thinking: suppose if someone had dropped dead. Surely someone’s going to tell me what it is. Where the hell did it come from? Everyone’s telling me it’s probably a boat cleaning its tanks. But not to worry, they said, the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency are checking it out.”According to a freedom of information request, Public Health England’s working hypothesis, revealed in an email sent to the Cabinet Office at 1am that night, was that “a tanker in the English Channel suffered a leakage of ammonia”, even though only small amounts had been detected at Birling Gap. As well as monitoring fuel emissions, the International Maritime Organization regulates the discharge of effluent and bilge water, chemical-cargo vapours, tank-cleaning chemicals and ballast-water disinfectants. Any of these, released deliberately or by accident, may have been to blame. Sawyer found two reports of a chemical tanker washing out its tanks on the edge of the fishing lanes that day, but the vessel was not identified. The coastguard received a report of a vessel discharging “odd-coloured exhaust” but it, too, has been ruled out as being in the wrong place at the wrong time.At the Sovereign Harbour lifeboat station, a live GPS screen shows all the vessels in the Channel. Looking out through the window, I can make out only two or three hazy ghosts of ships on the horizon, but the screen shows dozens – private yachts, trawlers, 30,000-tonne tankers, 150,000-tonne container ships – with their rate of knots and direction, and ports of origin and destination. Little can pass through the Channel unmonitored.Using techniques developed in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster in April 1986, the Met Office was able to trace the course of the plume in the hours before it reached Birling Gap. According to Defra, “The surface air had come over the sea from an easterly direction for the previous nine hours but before that the wind had been… from the west. This strongly suggests an offshore source in the northern part of the English Channel, and effectively rules out France or onshore sources in southern England.” But the timescale, the size of the area from which the substance could have come and the fact that it hadn’t been identified meant the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency was unable to narrow down the number of suspect vessels to fewer than 180, many of which were hundreds of miles away by the time the analysis was done.In Fuller’s experience, the event is unprecedented in Britain. The only incident that comes close occurred in 1997, when a tanker collision off Ostend, Belgium, sent a cloud of petrol vapour across central England, causing irritation to skin and eyes. But both the substance and its source were quickly identified. “We tend to focus on air pollution in towns,” he adds. “We forget there are big sources out there, just a few miles off the coast.”Professor John Sodeau, an expert in air pollution and atmospheric chemistry at University College Cork, believes the weather conditions on the day are crucial to understanding what happened. He suggests that sulphurous emissions from ships’ engines reacted with chlorine-containing substances used in the cleaning of ballast or cargo tanks, and the resulting gases and vapours accumulated in the sunny, windless conditions. As he puts it, “Throw the ingredients into a saucepan, bring to the boil, put on a lid and leave to simmer.” Such a “soup” could not only cause symptoms of the kind reported when blown ashore, but could result in the creation of compounds that might smell like burning plastic or chlorine, as well as raising ozone levels.But shipping waste was not the only theory. Two days after the event, the Twitter account of the NERC Earth Observation Data Acquisition and Analysis Service (Neodaas) posted an image recorded by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 satellite at 10.56 on the morning of the cloud. It shows Birling Gap on the coast, and on the water, about five miles to the south-west, a slender plume of what looks like smoke. It is about two miles long and extends in a roughly easterly direction. No ship is visible. The following day, another Twitter user replied: “That is the position of the wreck of ww1 tanker Mira.”The SS Mira, a merchant oil tanker sunk by a mine in October 1917, lies 20 metres underwater at almost precisely the point from which the plume appears to originate. Could this have been the source? Ben Taylor of Neodaas, who posted the images, says the plume is not visible in satellite passes from the previous month, and first appears seven hours before people began to experience symptoms at Birling Gap. It was soon observed that the plume was heading in the wrong direction to have hit Birling Gap – east, rather than west with the wind. Taylor now believes it was not gas or vapour but underwater silt, disturbed by the shifting of the 100-year-old wreck and carried on currents. But as he says, “The timing is certainly strange.”For his part, Tony Fitch, who was fishing at Pevensey Bay that day, is convinced the cloud came from a French nuclear power station, more than 60 miles across the Channel. He has asked his GP to test him for the effects of radiation. It would not be the first time a substance carried on the air from France affected the region: people in Eastbourne and across southern England remember “Le Pong” of 2013, when an escape of methanethiol, a chemical used to add a warning odour to domestic gas, floated over from a chemical works in Rouen, 100 miles away.The ersity of public theories about the origin of the substance – chlorine gas leaking from a first world war wreck an accident at an incinerator some creation of a nearby offshore windfarm a top-secret military psyop – is inevitable, given that the substance remains officially unidentified eight months later. It was for this reason, too, that the Maritime \u0026amp Coastguard Agency aborted its investigation in late September.“They told me all the way through,” says Stephen Lloyd MP, “‘Don’t worry, we’ve identified the ships that were in the area, but we have to wait till they port before we check it out.’ But then six weeks later I hear: ‘No, we’re not doing it, there’s no point, because we don’t know what it is.’ It is criminally wrong that this country and our emergency services don’t have the kit that can store, assess and measure what the hell this was.”Lloyd is not alone in pressing for more information. Green party MEP Keith Taylor has asked Defra whether the incident was reported to the European Commission. The Seveso directive states a report must be made by an EU member country if more than 500 people are “evacuated or confined” for over two hours as a result of an accident involving a dangerous substance. He believes the event meets these criteria, but the commission can find no record of such a report being made, and Defra has not responded to requests for clarification. “It is hard to escape the feeling that the government has consistently shrugged its shoulders in response to this incident,” Taylor says.He also highlights a second incident, four miles along the coast exactly two months later. On the night of 27 October, a stench of burning plastic was reported by residents of Seaford, along with burning eyes and nausea. Although the council attributed the odour to nearby agricultural activity, residents wondered if there was a connection to the more serious event that summer.Defra’s scientific report into the incident, released in January, concludes that, while a ship remains the most likely culprit, “unless further information is obtained, it may never be possible to identify the precise source of the release”.“If one old person or one baby had died because of this gas,” Lloyd says, “and no one knew what it was, my God, there would have been resignations of chief executives and secretaries of state.”In December, Defra announced a review of the emergency response which, among other issues, will investigate “the practicalities of taking, storing and analysing gas samples in future events of this kind”. But the experts have their doubts. “You do not just collect the air in a bell jar and take it home for later analysis,” says air pollution specialist John Sodeau. “Samples have to be collected on site and analysed in real time. The levels may be parts per trillion or billion and the chemical radicals involved may last for only seconds.”Defra’s review is ongoing. It has no plans to make its findings public. For Eastbourne district general hospital, the event was a valuable learning exercise. Dr Atesli has been asked to speak about it at medical conferences. “You don’t expect something like this in Eastbourne,” he says. “But it can happen.”Laura Knight, whose cough lasted for two weeks, still hopes for answers. “It’s really concerning,” she says. “I don’t know if there’s something in my body, and nobody else knows either.”On my last visit, Birling Gap was busy with visitors enjoying the midwinter sun. The only haze was from the waves crashing on the chalk foreshore, the only masks worn by a few Japanese tourists making their way across the car park. On the horizon, the world’s ships plied back and forth.• William Atkins’ The Immeasurable World: Journeys In Desert Places will be published in June.Commenting on this piece?

Yet having seen his team lose their previous three games – away and home to Liverpool in the Champions League, and in the league to United – the manager cited the example of Real Madrid in 2003‑04, when they led Valencia by a point but suffered six defeats in the final seven matches to finish fourth in La Liga, behind Rafael Benítez’s then side.City are at Tottenham Hotspur for Saturday’s late fixture. A victory, combined with a United defeat against West Brom on Sunday would secure the title but it was put to Guardiola that if City lose and United beat West Bromwich Albion and Bournemouth before his side play again they may start to feel the pressure.In this scenario United would have cut the deficit to seven points having played a match more. Guardiola said: “It can happen. Football is full of emotions but what we have to try to do is focus and win our games against Tottenham, Swansea and after that the other ones. So we know that.Regarding how pressure is more intense when trying to seal the title, Guardiola said: “That will be good for our future, you have to handle that. You have to learn that because, at the end, if we were not able to do it and United win the league, all we can say is ‘congratulations’ to United, reflect on what we have done badly in the last month and move forward. But in football it can happen.”Guardiola countered any notion that such a scenario is unlikely. “Of course it can happen, I assure you. Real Madrid, years ago, lost six games and didn’t win the league. So of course it can happen, no doubts about that.”“When the opponent is good, we will congratulate our opponents on beating us, and after learn from that for the next game.”While Guardiola admitted Sergio Agüero’s ability to play again this season is in the balance because of a knee problem, the Spaniard said the 32-year-old David Silva may appear less next year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7014128a5dc2cc14da5fe1f5270e42695f7dd8c1/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a82df8677d1ea381d919354236f34384 1240w","title":"a letter to the man who was my dad in all but name","story":"‘When I needed a constant father figure, that’s what you provided’: the letter you always wanted to writeIt’s been almost four years since you died, and there are so many things I wish I’d said to you, and so many things I wish we’d done together.

Of all the remarkable transformations in supergentrified London, that of King’s Cross is the most astonishing. I can just remember what it was, dim memories of jigging at its warehouse clubs in the 90s. Before my time, there’s always Mona Lisa (the film) and reruns of The Sweeney to recreate the area’s prostitution and darkness, its dripping railway arches and encrusted tenements. Railway stations used to blight areas, their comings and goings attracting the kind of untrustworthy spivs who terrorise the older women in The Ladykillers. Nowadays they’re “hubs”, their sleek bars and delis paused in by commuters off to Potters Bar, their luxury apartments paused in by tech millionaires off to Singapore. We all come and go these days.

I started going to gigs at 16. Now I’m 47, and maybe I’m someone who hasn’t grown up because I typically go to between 40 and 50 gigs a year, all over the UK. It usually costs me about £500 a month, including travel.I’m a big fan of singer-songwriters, and old-school indie bands. My favourite artists are Morrissey, Adam Ant and Robert Forster, former member of the Go-Betweens. I’ve seen Forster 50 times in the last 30 years. He once did three UK gigs on consecutive nights in Glasgow, Manchester and London. I went to all three.I will also spend up to £20 on merchandise at each gig. But often I’ve already got all the stuff they’re selling – I spend £80 to £100 on CDs, books, DVDs and vinyl each month. It varies, depending on what has been released and whether I can resist the temptation.I don’t just listen to music – I play it, too. I own 25 guitars but they weren’t very expensive. The most I’ve ever spent on a guitar is £500.I don’t buy MP3s or subscribe to Spotify and I’ll always pay £1 extra for a ticket to be posted. I like owning a product. I’ve probably got over 1,000 vinyl records and maybe 2,000 CDs. Many are autographed or limited editions. I’ve got singles I paid £1.99 for that are worth £150, but I’d never sell them. They are for my kids.Songs come to life when you hear them performed live. There are subtle differences, you can hear the artist at work. I also love discovering the support acts. I once saw The Killers supporting British Sea Power at Colchester Arts Centre.Each music venue affects the character of the gig in different ways and changes how I experience the music. Life is about experiences, after all. You can’t take your money with you. All you have on your deathbed is what you’ve done with your life and the places you’ve been.I recently bought a folding bike for £100 so I could explore all the music venues in the cities I visit for gigs. I’m curious about venues whose names I know well from tour itineraries, and towns I wouldn’t normally go to. I find I often have great conversations with like-minded people I don’t know in the crowd. I’ve written a book, London Gig Venues, which covers 600 music venues in the city.Quite often, I’ll work out a route round the UK that enables me to combine our family holidays with a gig I want to go to.My very understanding wife will stay in, looking after our three children. We used to go together, before babysitters. Her favourite band is the Pet Shop Boys. Once we got tickets to see them, but my wife went into labour late. A day or two after the child was born, I went off with her sister to the gig. It’s unfortunate they were her favourite band but it didn’t make sense to waste the tickets.My daughter Ciara, who is 11, has been to about 20 gigs with me over the past two years. Often, when the band sees a little girl in the audience, they point her out. So she thinks every gig you go to, the artist makes a reference to it or you get to meet him or her afterwards.My wife has her own lifestyle PR agency and I work for her. We split the household bills. I pay £200 for council tax, £230 for gas and electricity, and £400 on food each month. My wife pays the mortgage and the broadband and mobile phone bills. She knew I was obsessed with music when we married but I have promised her I’ll cut down on gigs this year.Sometimes the children roll their eyes and say: “Daddy’s off to a gig again.” But I’m not someone who goes off to the pub or watches football. Music is my passion.As told to Donna Ferguson"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23ddeb1c231125bb3a2b5cff4777fedb30e5c83c/0_1290_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e7e2c4048124a5a5c1a13f3ada06623 1240w","title":"tinashe people are past point they think im a mindless puppet","story":"The R\u0026ampB star has defied bullies, the wrath of Wendy Williams and the insidious music industry. With her new album Joyride, has her moment finally arrived?Halfway through school at California’s Crescenta Valley High, budding actor Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe made a new best friend. She was delighted to have found this new acquaintance, and sad when she had to leave school for two months to shoot a TV movie, Cora Unashamed. On her return to Crescenta, she discovered her BFF didn’t like her any more. No one did. Her friend turned into a bully and created a We Hate Tinashe group of which she was leader. She would ring Kachingwe at home to describe exactly how she was going to “fuck her up” at school the next day. She, like everyone else, didn’t like the fact Kachingwe was on TV. “There were groups of girls who would throw food at me in the hallways,” she remembers. “Like, cereal. And milk. Gross stuff like that. People were pretty mean.” Despite such torrential tormenting, the 25-year-old – now the singer who goes simply by Tinashe – is remarkably sanguine about these experiences. “It led me to be hyper-focused on what I wanted from life and that was how I was able to stay happy and not get depressive as a kid,” she says in the cafe of New York’s New Museum, where we meet to discuss her long-overdue second album proper, Joyride. “It’s easy to feel like the whole world is against you as a kid, but the world is bigger than school.” It’s a lesson Tinashe has retained, applying the same sage standards to “what people are saying online” about her life and music. “Everything will get better. You just have to keep focusing on what makes you happy and what fulfils you. For me that’s making music and performing.” Does she still see those girls? “Fuckin’ bitches,” she grins. “Where are they now?”Although people no longer chuck food at Tinashe’s head, they do throw a lot of shade her way. They question why her records don’t sell. With her catalogue a combination of subtle, silky trap and rap-infused tracks and glossy hits (Player the DJ Mustard co-produced 2 On her collaboration with Snakehips on All My Friends) critics say she’s either too pop or too R\u0026ampB – or not enough of either. “I think genres should just die,” she says. “As a human being, you don’t limit yourself to being one thing or other I don’t think people think of themselves in that way. It’s the same for how I present my music, how I listen to music, how I dress, how I live my life. It’s not black and white. Who you are is actually much more complex.”The last time she spoke to the Guardian the internet disseminated Tinashe’s thoughts on colourism and sexism (“Sometimes I feel like I don’t fully fit into the black community they don’t fully accept me, even though I see myself as a black woman,” being one quote). Television host Wendy Williams delivered a snippy three-minute bit about the interview. “She’s blaming Rihanna and Beyoncé for her lack of success?” Williams asked. “You have no one to blame but yourself, Tinashe. You gotta make your own path. Mariah, Drake and Alicia Keys are all biracial, so what’s your next excuse?”Meanwhile, fans and trolls lined up to wonder where the album was and whether it might sell more than her “critically acclaimed” (translation: didn’t sell well) debut, 2014’s Aquarius. This is another aspect of “the business” that Tinashe has little time for. “You’re either at this super-high level of fame and dominating the whole world or you’re a failure, which is just not accurate,” she insists. “My definition of success has changed over the course of this album. I’ve learned that making the music and art and videos I want to make, that’s enough for me. I don’t feel like I need all the accolades.”It has taken Tinashe time to reach such a place of self-satisfaction, however. With more than 200 tracks recorded and “numerous” iterations of Joyride in the vault, the album seemed destined never to see the light of day. Finally, last summer, Tinashe let go a little. She moved into a new home in the Hollywood Hills with sweeping views of LA and turned the guesthouse into a studio. She invited friends, producers, writers, graphic designers and artists over and together they zeroed in on the music, artwork and videos.“It was a really big turning point for me because I was able to focus creatively and get all my thoughts in one place. It really gave me perspective on what I’d already created and what I still needed to work on. It was more focused, more purposeful.”Joyride is a delightfully sleazy bop, full of red-light R\u0026ampB, woozy hip-hop and lyrics that linger on hook-ups and getting high. “It’s a snapshot of when I wasn’t in a relationship and I was trying to find myself,” she says. “That sense of confidence and almost braggadociousness was something that I wanted to express on the album – ‘I don’t need anybody, I’m good.’” She is now in a relationship with the basketball player Ben Simmons, another reason she’s living life a little lighter. “Ben has been an important part of being able to let go of the album creatively. Because you can get crazy,” she says.Funnily enough, it looks as if Joyride could just be a hit the Offset-featuring single No Drama clocked up a million views in one day, while the delightfully tactile Me So Bad and title track Joyride are streaming at rapid rates. The album is self-assured, a bit frivolous but occasionally weighty – such as on Easy on Me, which voices her frustrations with politics in the United States. The track, an interlude, is one of two Tinashe has produced on Joyride, having taught herself Pro Tools when she was 17. “When I first got on the scene I was honestly shocked that I could work for a whole year with hundreds of engineers and producers and not one would be another woman. We need to see more representation.”Having been in the entertainment industry for so much of her life – as both an actor (including her role as Celeste Burnett on Charlie Sheen’s Two and a Half Men) and a singer (who could forget her stint in the Stunners, a shortlived girlband signed to Columbia in 2007) – Tinashe has a deep understanding of the seismic shifts occurring at the moment. She believes, however, that the music business has a long way to go in order to catch up with the rest of the entertainment industry when it comes to the #MeToo movement.“Mostly it’s people’s perceptions of what it means to be a female artist and how you deal with your sexuality and people respecting your creative opinion. I haven’t had any straight-up, very outwardly sexist experiences in the music industry I’ve been very lucky. Maybe one session where I had to walk out where I was uncomfortable. But for the most part I’ve worked with really great people. The issue is really a systemic, cultural one that impacts across the board.”It’s time to leave the New Museum – Tinashe has a stack of CDs to sign before getting up at 4am to do Good Morning America. Before she goes, however, I wonder if she is really as happy, as calm, as sorted as she appears?“Honestly, yes. I think people respect me as an artist now. I’ve been making art for a good number of years. People have got past the point where they think I’m just a cute girl or a mindless puppet of a record label.” She may not yet be a superstar, but actually Tinashe is really very successful. And that’s more than enough. “However this album does, I’ve come to realise that I’m not going to stop making music if it isn’t a hit. I can say the same for the next album and the next album. So be it. I’m going to continue to make art and everything’s gonna be OK. I’m happy and confident and excited and proud of what I’ve done. Life is all right!”You believe her, you really do.Joyride is out now on RCA Records"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd46d18282e53e786314bf62f159e644e1204ee/0_167_2439_1463/master/2439.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82cac3cca467042bde4ed1cc74637e93 1240w","title":"pm among cabinet members earning money as a landlord","story":"Exclusive: senior politicians such as Theresa May and Boris Johnson make thousands of pounds a year renting propertyNine cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, are making more than £10,000 a year by acting as landlords, a Guardian analysis has found.Following Jeremy Hunt’s failure to declare the purchase of seven luxury flats that he subsequently rented out, an analysis of the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests shows eight other members of the cabinet own property that is rented out for a five-figure annual sum.The health secretary was forced to make an embarrassing apology on Friday after it emerged that he had failed to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs’ interests.Hunt has amended the register, which now shows that he has a half share of a holiday home in Italy, a half share in an office building in Hammersmith and seven recently acquired apartments in Southampton.Theresa May and Philip Hammond, who both live in Downing Street, rent out their personal homes in central London. Communities and housing secretary Sajid Javid also rents out property, while Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, rents out two properties, according to the registerThe foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the international trade secretary Liam Fox, the minister without portfolio Brandon Lewis – who is also the Conservative party chairman – and the Welsh minister Alun Cairns also own and rent out a property, according to the register.There is no suggestion that the ministers are in breach of the ministerial code.Hunt’s declared property interests are comfortably larger than any of the other ministers listed. He set up Mare Pond Properties Ltd with his wife, Lucia Guo which have since bought seven flats in Alexandra Wharf, a redevelopment project on the Southampton waterfront worth £40m.When the registration documents were filed in September 2017 only his wife was named, constituting a breach of regulations.Kathryn Hudson, parliament’s commissioner for standards, received a complaint about Hunt on Friday and will consider it early next week, a spokesperson said. Labour said Hunt’s actions represented a “serious breach”. Shadow cabinet office minister Jon Trickett said: “This is simply unacceptable and especially so given the secretary of state’s position at the heart of Theresa May’s government.”Guardian inquiries have established that the flats were developed by a property company owned by a Conservative donor.The 82-flat luxury block was developed by Nicolas James Group, a south coast property company owned and chaired by businessman and Conservative donor Nicolas James Roach.Roach has made more than £50,000 in donations to Hunt’s South West Surrey constituency office since 2011, mostly in the form of the complimentary venue hire.Hunt and Roach were pictured together in 2011 at a party to launch a £60m hotel partly developed by Roachs’ company in Guildford, which is in Hunt’s Surrey constituency.A spokeswoman for Hunt said: “The owner of the development is a long-standing acquaintance. Jeremy paid standard market rates which would have been available to anyone else making an equivalent purchase”.According to the property giant Savills, each flat in the development is worth between £450,000 and £1m. The spokeswoman blamed Hunt’s accountant for mistakes in the Companies House’ documents. “These were honest administrative mistakes, which have already been rectified,” she said. “Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing, which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.”A Downing Street spokesman said: “Jeremy has rightly apologised for an administrative oversight, and as the Cabinet Office have made clear there has been no breach of the ministerial code. “We consider the matter closed.” Dr Alex May, the academic who spotted Hunt’s omissions and whose email on 28 March prompted a change to Hunt’s Companies House filing, told the Guardian that the health secretary’s office only admitted wrongdoing after he went public with the information on Friday. “There is a lack of scrutiny from Companies House,” he said. “It allows people to break the law, sometimes unwittingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b22c13d0e561594d85eac3b51f3e47e80fb8a63/0_318_5254_3154/master/5254.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7dc885aee12ad3190fd1c08ea6cfac3c 2600w","title":"jeremy thorpe the charismatic liberal leader who hid dark secrets","story":"A BBC drama recounts the old Etonian’s bizarre story at the heart of a corrupt British establishmentIt’s a long time since the second week of May in 1979 when Jeremy Thorpe arrived in his lawyer’s brown Rolls Royce for the start of the trial that was billed as “the greatest show on earth”.Few people under 40 know who Thorpe even was, let alone the scandal that enthralled the country for more than a month as it unfolded at the Old Bailey. Yet the tale is so bizarre, so improbable and at the same time so revealing of the profound corruption of the British establishment that it seems wilfully irresponsible not to make its study a compulsory part of the national curriculum.Next month might change that. That’s when the BBC airs its star-studded account of the fantastical story of how Thorpe, the old Etonian who had led the Liberal party for a decade from the mid 1960s, faced trial on the charge of conspiracy to murder his former lover.The three-part drama, A Very English Scandal, written by Russell T Davies – responsible for acclaimed hits including Queer as Folk, Casanova and Cucumber – and directed by Stephen Frears, is based on the book of the same name by John Preston. It stars Hugh Grant as Thorpe and Ben Whishaw as Norman Scott, the young riding instructor with whom Thorpe conducted an on-off affair.Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, remembers Thorpe even before he became party leader. He came to speak to the Liberal club when he was at Cambridge in the mid 1960s. “Jo Grimond was party leader, Thorpe was the entertainment.” Thorpe’s charm didn’t work on Cable, who joined the Labour party.Thorpe was also gay. Early in the 1960s, when he had the affair with Scott, he was the newly elected Liberal MP for North Devon and homosexuality was still illegal. For more than 10 years, the paths of the two men crossed and recrossed, Thorpe’s career advancing as Scott, suffering from recurring mental illness, struggled.Thorpe and his small gang of cronies concluded Scott was a threat to Thorpe and the party. After repeated attempts to silence him, an inner circle began to consider a permanent solution. One of the more arresting claims at the trial was that Thorpe had suggested: “It would be no worse than shooting a sick dog.” How else is it possible to explain the two central questions of the Thorpe affair: why did Thorpe, , an iconoclastic campaigner for human rights and colonial freedom, think it was a sound idea to deal with a perceived threat by arranging the death of the person he feared?Why did it take so long to challenge him? And how, when finally brought to justice, did he get away with it? Thirty-one enthralling days after the trial at the Old Bailey began, Thorpe emerged triumphant, exonerated in law if not in the public esteem.Maybe his bisexuality – he was married, happily, twice and once told a crowd of Oxford undergraduates that he wasn’t married because “why buy a car when you can hire a taxi” – shaped an outlook that instinctively chose secrecy over transparency.Or perhaps the establishment simply preferred not to know. Maybe that curious mix of Whitehall with traditional political allegiances and deep social conservatism that revealed nothing of the dry rot eating its supporting joists, dealt with challenge by ignoring it.Most of the participants are dead. Thorpe himself, cruelly wracked by Parkinsons and still aggrieved never to have been rehabilitated with a seat in the Lords, died in 2014. Only Scott lives on in Devon, not far from the scene of the alleged attempt on his life.It is ancient history. Yet aspects of the trial feel uncomfortably fresh. The leading defence witness, Peter Bessell, was discredited mainly because before the trial he had unwisely flogged a story to the Daily Telegraph detailing what he had been prepared to do for Thorpe before they fell out. Cheque book journalism has never quite gone away.The judge, Sir Joseph Cantley, was a shameless social sycophant whose summing up to the jury, almost indistinguishable from a speech for the defence, dishonoured the reputation of British justice. That might not happen now, but the sense of a system where the avenues to the top are open almost exclusively to a narrow ethnic and social group that is also largely male is still all too familiar.And then there’s the politics.Thorpe was elected leader of his tiny party in 1967, the party’s 12 MPs were the only voters. Thorpe went further and faster than his predecessor, Grimond, developing a radical foreign policy fit for a post-colonial era. And he did it at a time when the plodding conservatism of both the main parties and the renewed radicalism of young voters dramatically magnified the effect.His wit and charm worked as well at a fundraising dinner as in the TV studios or, in the ultimate piece of 1970s symbolism, out wooing seaside holidaymakers from a hovercraft. (“What are you going to say to them?” asked his campaign manager, the MP John Pardoe. “Oh that’s for you to decide,” Thorpe loftily replied.)His alchemist’s touch with money helped to dispel doubts among party members becoming increasingly frustrated by his gang of chums and secretive manner. They didn’t know then how much of the cash he persuaded generous donors, like Jack Hayward, to part with was being erted to deal with his obsessive fear of Scott.And Thorpe was often a lucky politician. Events favoured him. Take Europe it was his tiny party’s votes that allowed the Tory government to steer European legislation through parliament in the early 70s.On the surface, Thorpe continued untarnished – the beguiling, charismatic leader of a minority party that was developing interesting, radical ideas about what politics was for.It was despite rather than because of Thorpe that Liberals discovered pavement politics and began to rebuild their party from the ground up. Yet at least some of this generation of young liberals had been drawn in by Thorpe’s radical energy.Ming Campbell, a former Lib Dem leader, thinks Thorpe’s successor, David Steel, was his real legacy. “What did we get? A son of the manse who shared his radicalism but none of his reputation.” Duncan Brack, a party historian, accepts that Thorpe trashed the brand. Yet, “he propelled the party into people’s consciousness. He got a lot of attention. His success in the two 1974 elections was the basis for the Alliance of the 1980s.”The Lib Dem blogger Mark Pack agrees: “The base that grew in the Alliance days began in his time. When Labour split, the Liberals were a more credible party than they might have been.”This is the Thorpe legacy: a disfigured memorial to the way the establishment could still look after its own even as the forces of modernity slowly washed away at its foundations. Some claim that the scandal changed the establishment for ever. If only.

Having looked like becoming a hot favourite when the weights were revealed two months ago, he remains a very reasonable price at 12‑1 and can give his trainer, Willie Mullins, a second success in the race he first won with Hedgehunter in 2005.Some will be put off by the fact that he fell when last seen but I can forgive that tumble, at the third-last in a typically hot Cheltenham Gold Cup. Many a good horse has been caught out by that fence and although the National field usually goes a strong pace, it is unlikely to match the Gold Cup for intensity.Timeform published some numbers this week showing that horses who fell last time out have a weak record in the National over the past decade. But those with longer memories will recall Rhyme N Reason falling in the 1988 Gold Cup and then landing the National the following month, while Red Marauder fell at the first fence in his prep run before winning at Aintree in 2001.The owner JP McManus also has a big chance of a second National success, though possibly not with his most obvious contender, Anibale Fly, whose jumping is not to be trusted. His Carlingford Lough is a class horse on a fair weight and has usually shown his best form in the second half of a season. Regal Encore also has each-way possibilities at big odds. Tiger Roll has to be on the short list after his cross-country success at Cheltenham, though he cannot be relied upon for a similarly doughty effort on back-to-back starts. Milansbar only just misses my top four and can keep Bryony Frost in contention for a long way. Conditions are possibly not quite attritional enough for Raz De Maree or Houblon Des Obeaux but both will appeal to each-way or place-only punters.2.25 The hugely promising and unbeaten On The Blind Side missed Cheltenham because of a minor setback but will be all the fresher here and can sustain the stable’s fine run.3.00 Petit Mouchoir had a hard race last month, so this is a fine chance for Shantou Rock.3.40 Blinkers helped Paper Lantern to an impressive Easter win at Fairyhouse and he may be hard to catch if they do the trick again.4.20 Having fared best of the British runners well when third in the Stayers’ Hurdle, Wholestone can take this less-demanding contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6104861bbc332f057d22b77698e34e845e6cc99e/0_0_2623_1573/master/2623.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3df8c8ff0f5c5c285b5783fc6230864c 1240w","title":"leeds wigan rugby super league match report","story":"• Leeds 8-9 Wigan• Tomkins manages five points as Wigan win from 8-0 downPerhaps it was inevitable Sam Tomkins would have the last laugh. In the moments leading up to kick-off, he was ridiculed by the Leeds supporters after slipping while attempting a warm-up conversion attempt. In true Tomkins fashion, it still sailed through the posts.Tomkins has plenty of previous with Leeds, of course – seven years ago he was in the thick of the headlines when Wigan beat the Rhinos in the Challenge Cup final – but how he and Wigan will have savoured this moment more than most.Wins at Leeds do not come easily for Wigan, who had not won here since 2012. And, just as he has been so many times before, Tomkins was at the heart of this latest performance, though the question remains as to how many more he will be involved in beyond this season.Speculation continues to link the 29-year-old with a move to Catalans for 2019 the general consensus is that the deal is already done. “Whatever happens, we’ll deal with it,” responded Shaun Wane when asked about Tomkins’s future. On nights like these it is clear to see why Wigan would want to keep him.And a remarkable ending – in which Wigan overturned an eight-point deficit in the final nine minutes to win courtesy of Tomkins’s game-winning drop goal – at least managed to somewhat overshadow a game which is highly unlikely to make it to the end-of-season highlights package.For over an hour, both sides toiled amidst a host of penalties and handling errors it was far from the ideal advert for Super League in a game featuring the competition’s last two champions. And when Leeds went eight points ahead with 16 minutes remaining, the smart money was on them leapfrogging Wigan into second place. And, in their coach’s own enigmatic way, he summed up their collapse well. “We stuck our heads up our backside and didn’t pull them out,” Brian McDermott said. “We started playing crazy and we changed the way we played.”Leeds scored the only try of a largely forgettable and frustrating first half, after a fine Richie Myler pass found Tom Briscoe unmarked. It was a rare moment of quality, with the next points not coming until after the hour mark when Watkins kicked Leeds into a two-score lead.Wigan’s performance to that point was epitomised by Tomkins, whose effort and endeavour was underlined by unforced errors, but he would ultimately have the final say. He played a part in the move which allowed Oliver Gildart to score with nine minutes remaining, and after he kicked the conversion, he followed suit with a penalty before sending over the drop goal which won the game with three minutes left."},{"url":null,"title":"grand national 2018 a horse by horse betting guide","story":"We go through the 40 runners for the 2018 edition of the world’s most famous horse raceWon the Irish Grand National in 2015, beating Rule The World at level weights, form which looked pretty good when the runner-up won the next year’s Grand National. Has not won since and yet somehow remains 6lb higher than for his Fairyhouse success. Was not to blame for his jockey being knocked out of the saddle in this last year but harder to make excuses for his falls in his last two races, since he got about halfway up the fence on each occasion and was under no great pressure at the time. The ability is probably still in there somewhere.Looked the likely winner when going clear after the third-last a year ago but was on fumes by the final fence and faded into fourth. More conservative tactics might help but he’s 9lb higher and carries 12lb more in absolute terms. Romped to glory in the Becher, showing how well he goes round here, but the extra weight he got for that did not help at Haydock in February, where he couldn’t go with the easy winner and finished tired. Travelled well and was still going on at the finish when third in the Gold Cup, suggesting he might cope with this distance. Beat 27 rivals by daylight in a hotly contested handicap chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Still on a beatable rating but this is asking a lot, with a big weight to carry. Doesn’t always get that high at his fences and took a heavy fall in the Irish Gold Cup. Also took a liberty at Cheltenham’s third-last and there is likely to be at least one scare along the way.Couldn’t finish quite as strongly as a classy rival when second in the 2016 National. Shot up the ratings, has not won since and is still 10lb higher than that day. Faded into a well-beaten 16th last year and something similar seems likely. Admirably consistent but in need of luck.Wasn’t far off the best when with Willie Mullins, for whom he won two Grade Ones as a novice. May well have won the 2016 Irish Gold Cup, but for unseating at the last. Missed a year and four runs since his comeback seem to show him in decline. Still high in the weights, just 5lb below his peak, and would need something like his best to get involved here. Stamina must also be taken on trust, as he’s never raced beyond three miles and a furlong.Instantly improved by last summer’s move to Willie Mullins, since when his only failure has been a fall in the Gold Cup. Won the Munster National easily and then scrambled home in the Ladbrokes Trophy, when held up for a late challenge. Now 9lb higher but likely to have more to offer and wasn’t out of it when hitting the deck at Cheltenham. A clear round will surely put him in contention.Not far short of the best as a staying hurdler and useful over fences but is rated to the hilt of his ability. Ran a fair race to be eighth in last year’s Irish National, when he was hampered by a faller, and beaten only by Total Recall in the Munster National, trying to give him lumps of weight. Not usually a strong finisher and has broken blood vessels at times.Cheltenham specialist who has run many fine races there but not usually to the same level elsewhere. Pulled up at the fourth-last a year ago and only 2lb lower in the weights this time but trainer says he had an interrupted preparation then. A sound jumper and solid stayer with no secrets from the handicapper and likely to be outpaced by something if still in contention after the last.Would have an extra 4lb to carry if the weights had not been set in February, since when he ran a fine second at the Cheltenham Festival, finishing strongly to be beaten by a neck. Promising teenage jockey who rode that day will be aboard again. Pulled up four fences from home last year but was only seven and entitled to do better now. Hasn’t won since but several efforts have suggested he is ready for this marathon trip. Slight concern that his Cheltenham form is so much better than elsewhere.A front-runner when things go well, he never got involved last year and finished 17th. In common with most of his stablemates, has been well below his best this year but the yard is now getting winners. Wins over fences have come in small fields, which does not augur well here. It’s more than five years since he won at a track where the bends go to the left.Irish Gold Cup winner of 2015 and 2016, this veteran has dropped a stone from his peak rating in the past year and is now on a weight that would make him dangerous if he returned to something like his best. Has shown little in four runs this season but all came before New Year, when he has not traditionally been at his best. Interesting.Has been useful and consistent around the northern tracks this winter but it’s hard to believe he has the class for this and his stamina seems to have been exposed by weak finishing efforts in his last two starts.Three times a winner at the Cheltenham Festival, including in the Cross-Country last month. Has also won a Munster National, so neither big fields nor marathon distances are a problem. He’s not wonderfully consistent and was well beaten on the two previous occasions when he ran a month after Festival success. Also, he’s not the biggest and could meet trouble when the field bunches up at the Becher’s – Canal Turn section of the course. But he undoubtedly has the talent to win and it would be no surprise if he did so with authority.Ran on in eye-catching style to be eighth last year, having seemingly been given too much to do. Put up another fine effort when third in the Ladbrokes Trophy in December and warmed up for this by scoring at Ascot in February. Has taken years to build on his early promise but finally doing so and has it in him to land a major prize. Still on a fair weight and 4lb well in, as his Ascot win came after the weights were set.Hoping it can be third time lucky but the limitations of his stamina seemed to be exposed by the last two Nationals. Has had a poor season, failing to finish within 12 lengths of a winner, but is slightly higher in the ratings than for his previous two attempts, which hardly seems fair. Comes from a stable having a poor run.Muddy marathons are the thing for this winner of last year’s Midlands National. On drier ground or against classy opposition, he generally gets left behind. Having won at Haydock in November, he went up 10lb and has struggled in two subsequent runs, suggesting he lacks the necessary quality unless it rains plenty. A dogged galloper, he goes well at Newbury and should therefore be suited by this circuit. Looked as though he was reaching the limits of his stamina when headed close home in the Great Yorkshire Chase, over a mile shorter than this. Up against it, on a rating 12lb higher than when he last won.Third in the Scottish National two years ago, though his jumping was scrappy at times and his stamina gave out about a furlong from the line. Has had a wind operation. Because of injuries, his decent third in a much shorter race last month was his first run over fences for 16 months, which is not ideal preparation. Nicely weighted on the pick of his form, including a defeat of Blaklion at Cheltenham two years ago. Jumped the last with the leaders last year but had nothing left and tired into fifth, having taken a shoulder-barge from the runner-up at the second-last. Fell at the first in 2015 but usually does well over these fences, having won here in December. Has held his form so well that he is now rated higher than ever, 4lb higher than for last year’s race. Another respectable showing is likely.Career best in January when running away with the Peter Marsh, pulling 13 lengths clear of Captain Redbeard. Was fired up the ratings to a mark 9lb higher than he’s ever been and may struggle to compete until he drops back down. He was carrying less weight that day than four other finishers of moderate talent, whereas here he will mix with Festival winners on a similar weight. Stopped quickly and was found to have bled from the nose when pulled up at Haydock in February.Given every chance last year by a masterful Ruby Walsh ride, creeping smoothly into contention on the second circuit before getting tired from the third-last and finishing ninth. Jumped soundly but stumbled and nearly unseated on landing over second Valentine’s, which can’t have helped. Only 1lb lower, despite modest efforts on both starts this season, and won’t have Walsh’s help. This plodder must be one of the few horses to spend three years in Gordon Elliott’s yard without winning. Often runs well, however, and has twice been placed in the Thyestes and also in Leopardstown’s Paddy Power Chase. Was a distant sixth in this race two years ago after notable mistakes. Went well last year until a rival jumped across him at Becher’s, causing his rider to fall off. Generally a sound jumper but will surely find something too quick for him on the run-in, even if his stamina holds up.Fine record at Aintree in April stretches back to 2011, when he won a Grade One novice hurdle. Won a handicap chase the next year and has since been second and third in the National, from four attempts. Soft ground is no use, as he showed when pulled up in 2016. Gets to run off the same rating as when third last year but we can’t be sure he retains his ability aged 12. He’s had just two runs this season and predictably failed to cope with soggy ground both times. Stable has been quiet for a month or two.Improved this season, winning comfortably at Ascot in November and running a fine third there the next month. Bad ground probably explains his Haydock flop in January and he’s presumably been freshened up since that most recent outing. May well have more to offer, though his stamina for this distance is in doubt.Stormed clear in the Welsh Grand National and would have done the same the previous season if he hadn’t bumped into a future Gold Cup winner in Native River. Is also a winner of the Munster National and two Cork Nationals, giving him an excellent record in big-field marathons. Gone up another 6lb to match the highest rating he’s ever had and Chepstow form does not always translate well to Aintree. He’s a hold-up horse who will therefore need luck, which he didn’t get last year, when he unseated his jockey while dodging a faller. Would be the oldest winner for 95 years but clearly is not in decline. Very dangerous if able to get into contention by the third-last.Entered the reckoning with an authoritative success in the North Yorkshire Grand National, when he made all the running. Went up a stone in the weights, which is a lot for beating five finishers who have done little for the form. That might have been his big day, in a race the trainer was winning for the third year in a row, at a course where this horse is unbeaten. But he copes well with a stamina test and could have more to offer.Has a good record round Aintree’s Mildmay course, which may not translate to the much bigger National course and fences. Disappointing when eighth there in November and had a wind operation the next month. Unraced since mid-December, an unorthodox National preparation. Likes a dry-ish surface, so could do without much rain. Fairly weighted and could get involved if everything falls right but more likely to be seeking softer targets.Tough, staying mare who is still young enough to have her best days ahead of her, being younger than any National winner since 1940. Never got into it when sixth in the 2016 Irish National and could only find the one pace when fifth in the Welsh National that year. Last seen running a fair third in Punchestown’s National Trial, giving weight to the first two, who made that form look good in the Irish National. She’s in big trouble if a turn of foot is required but, granted soft ground, she could get a lot of these in trouble by grinding along relentlessly in front.Went into a lot of notebooks as a National type when bolting up by 12 lengths in a race on the Mildmay course here two years ago, but then had to miss last year’s National after a badly timed injury. Hard to say how much ability he retains, as he’s been raced so sparingly and often over hurdles but it’s a concern that he is now older than any National winner since 1923. Leap of faith required.Stamina is the most obvious weak spot for this talented but frustrating type who appears not to be the most robust. Beaten over 100 lengths into 13th two years ago, eased down on the run-in on soft ground. Has only had two runs since, when a fine second in last year’s Kim Muir and when well beaten in the same race this year. Ground made the difference it was good when he was second, very testing when he flopped. Hard to believe he’s a National winner in waiting. Famously frustrating beast who has finished fast but too late on many a day, often after killing his chance with a mistake. Has been held back by metal pins in a back leg but the trainer says he’s moving better than ever and won a decent pot at Sandown in January. Offsetting that he ran so poorly when 12th in the 2016 National on soft ground, which should have suited, and after a much stronger season than this one.One of the least experienced in the field after just four runs over fences, of which his only win came in a 2016 beginners’ chase. Background and pedigree suggest his stamina might not stretch to a race like this and he was pulled up on his only attempt in a long-distance handicap chase. Doesn’t seem to like big fields. Rating looks a bit high. Hard to fancy.Ruined his chance last year by boiling over before the start. Did pretty well, then, to work his way into contention by the second-last but was a tired seventh in the end. Fell on his only outing since, when heavy ground did not suit. If the weather dries up and he behaves himself, it’s not beyond him to get involved off a rating that has dropped a stone and a half from his peak. He was a dual Festival winner but four years is a long time to make your supporters wait for another victory.Game and consistent, he’s already had an excellent season, winning the Tommy Whittle in December and chasing home The Dutchman in the Peter Marsh back at Haydock. Warmed up with a first hurdles success for two years. Still on a beatable rating in the right contest but this might not be it. There’s a lot more strength in depth than he’s used to meeting and all his wins have come in single-figure fields. Not the most efficient jumper, mixing flamboyant leaps with the odd mistake. He didn’t have much left at the end of his last two races.Thoroughly experienced plodder after 38 starts over fences. By no means a prolific winner in recent seasons, though he managed to nick a weak race at Sandown in November. Got round in his own time to be 10th last year, beaten by 42 lengths. Could do better if the ground is soft. Blinkers may have helped when he was third at Ascot last month and could do so again. A distant third in the Welsh National last season and has since dropped 9lb, while his stable has finally hit form after a bleak winter, so a case can be made for him plugging on into fifth, maybe.Veteran of 46 races over fences showed his wellbeing by winning round Cheltenham’s cross-country course in December. Has twice been second in the Irish National and was beaten just a short-head in 2016 under Ruby Walsh. Now 6lb higher than when second at Fairyhouse last year. Jumping has never been flawless but a clear round could easily put him in the leading bunch on the run from the third-last. Doubtful he can be fastest from there. Could do with the ground drying up.Gave a mulish display when dropping himself out in the Welsh National and was then remarkably revived by the fitting of blinkers when an easy winner of Warwick’s Classic Chase. A change of jockey may also have helped. Believing he would miss the cut for this, connections raced him in two more marathons on heavy going in the past two months, including a fair second in the Midlands National. Will have to be remarkably robust to show his best form here at the end of such a taxing season.Close second in the Badger Ales on his first run of the season but went up a few pounds and has not really shone in stronger races since. Travelled strongly in the Welsh National and Kim Muir before the limitations of his stamina appeared to be shown up in both. Was running a fair race just behind the leaders when his saddle slipped at the second Canal Turn two years ago, causing him to be pulled up. Now 7lb lower and capable of going well again, though his form this season has been patchy. Was giving lumps of weight to the first three when fourth at Chepstow in October and plugged on gamely to be fourth in the Kim Muir last month. Stamina must be in question, given he got tired and faded in the Hennessy for the last two years.Career peaked with an extremely game effort to be third in an attritional Cheltenham Gold Cup three years ago, when quality rivals like Many Clouds, Silviniaco Conti and Carlingford Lough were a long way behind. Ran to a high level for another season after that and was second in the 2016 Irish Gold Cup but has been two stones below his best in the last year. Enthusiasm seems to be on the wane, despite various bits of headgear being tried. On a dangerously low rating if he ever does bounce back to something like his best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3932ab78b3cccef81020a8e73d7b1d8e674459a5/67_16_3449_2070/master/3449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e9765b761ee7e20a78e2bbc8b8b8867 1240w","title":"england test tea top six cricket pakistan series","story":"Nobody ever feels completely ready for the start of the English cricket season but here it is all the same, blooming up out of the April mulch with an agreeably heavyweight opening round of fixtures on Friday. As ever it is a part of this process to feel a bit anxious. A sense of decorative decay, of fighting constantly for space and air has always been a part of cricket in England.This is, after all, a sport where the entire season tends to fold together into a microcosm of a single family day out at the English seaside, a five-month blur of travel, wet shoes, existential gloom, the consolations of ritual food and familiar faces, and buried somewhere along the way those brief, chancy moments of sun-drenched beauty that end up defining the entire experience in a snapshot.There is an extra layer of uncertainty this time around, something nagging away just out of sight at the start of the seven-Test summer. Sporting anxieties come in various shades. This one is highly specific and also something of a tell when it comes to wider currents of change.Yes, it’s the top six! It’s Cook-Stoneman-Vince-Root-Malan-Stokes, incumbent members of England’s Test match top six, which was once a matter of vital shared urgency but has become an oddly troubling thing, a little strange, a little distant and blurred.England’s No 3. England’s No 5. These are important people. Knowing exactly who they are at any given moment is a bit like knowing who the current James Bond is or the latest Doctor Who. The first really epic‑feeling top six I can remember was England’s 1985 Ashes powerhouse: Graham Gooch and Tim Robinson at the top, followed by the miracle of David Gower at No 3, swaying and bobbing in his wide-brimmed hat, like the most inely talented scarecrow ever to raise a bat and below him the reassuringly paunchy, sweating rump of Gatting-Lamb-Botham.Fast forward to the present day and it seems the same batsmen from England’s disastrous Test winter will keep their spots against Pakistan next month. This despite the fact there is a fair statistical argument they add up to England’s weakest top six of the modern age.Trevor Bayliss has already announced the cupboard is bare when it comes to alternatives, a masterstroke of demotivation for every single current county cricketer and a statement that confirms the impression of Bayliss as a lavishly rewarded head coach who is not only unmoved by Test cricket but also inconvenienced by its basic existence, wincing and prevaricating beneath his floppy hat like a crisis-ridden minor shadow cabinet minister ambushed by TV cameras on a fishing trip.Meanwhile the basic notion of the Test match top six, its primacy as a thing, continues to atrophy. There have been periods of fragility before but this top six feels different: miscast and a little vague, a product of carelessness and category mistake.Even the openers feel wrong. Alastair Cook has been a giant of English cricket, a patch of cold white light in the middle of all that gruelling heat. But he plays now with a constant flinch, most often seen wandering off with that air of wounded nobility, a minor central European monarch being marched through the palace colonnades en route to his own impeachment.Mark Stoneman has been a fun addition, an opener, finally, who strikes the ball aggressively. But when playing the short ball like a man swatting flies with a frying pan is no longer reason to be dropped as an England opener, then we might as well all give up.No 3 remains an odd kind of problem. The ideal Test No 3 has some base note of genuine aristocratic talent. Brian Lara came jogging out still casually putting on bits of kit, waggling at the buckles of his pads, as though he’d just tumbled out of bed and into the Rolls and down the pavilion steps. James Vince does have a real beauty in his batting, most obviously in that easy yawning drive through the covers. But it seems pretty obvious Joe Root at No 4 scoring fifties should be Joe Root at No 3 scoring hundreds, defining this team from the tipping point.Below him, Ben Stokes at six is pretty much the only real note of authenticity, a No 6 who comes out as all No 6s should, in a genuine fury, reeking of cigars and body odour, with a sense of bristling disdain for his opponents, for the five batsmen ahead of him and for the five still to come.So what now? As ever, this becomes a discussion about changing times, talent-drain, old forms being shunted to one side like an outdated combine harvester. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Test cricket is not dead. There is no reason to accept this. The product is still good. It just needs some care, to be nursed along as it always has been, not to be abandoned or left to wither while T20 defines itself on another stage.For now, England need to rip out the cobwebs, to take a chance on talent, to give the Test team the same invigorating approach afforded the white-ball line-up. Get Jonny Bairstow up the order. Haseeb Hameed needs to play, and keep playing. We can handle it. Just give us a team and a top six to believe in, while the memory that all this matters still remains."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23a5479ee198fda4aa68de945e6c1a0211bb723e/0_0_4575_3198/master/4575.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3799f4068b72f87e4863120823c462c5 1400w","title":"commonwealth games 2018 day 10 athletics cycling boxing and more live","story":"The first squash bronze medal match is over, and New Zealand’s Joelle King and Paul Coll have bulldozed England’s Alison Waters and Daryl Selby, by two games to love.

Tracey Neville’s side chipped away at the deficit, with Helen Housby shooting well and Geva Mentor and Eboni Beckford-Chambers in defence forcing Fowler-Reid into rare missed shots. She missed three in the whole game, scoring 47. Housby netted to level at 50-50 with six minutes remaining, but England needed to keep up the intensity. Jamaica levelled at 55-all with 25 seconds remaining. England used the clock, Housby missed, but Harten kept her composure to spark jubilant celebrations. After semi-final defeats in all five previous editions of the Commonwealth Games in which netball has been included, with three bronze medals, England finally have a shot at gold. “What a comeback for our girls,” Neville, a Commonwealth bronze medallist in 1998, said. “I just said to them now: as a player I only dreamed to be in this situation, but I was never good enough. It’s great to live my dream through these and they’ve just done so well.” Tracey Neville talks about England’s netball semi-final triumph:We come out really sluggish, we didn’t take the game to them. But, do you know what, the way they come through it, I’m so proud of them. I’m really emotional. They’re such a hard-working team. We always knew we’d need 12 players to beat this opposition, and it was which players could make an impact and chug back at the Jamaicans. We decided we needed a little bit more height and a bit more experience, and oh my god, they were amazing.The second netball semi-final, between Australia and New Zealand, is in the second quarter. Australia lead 24-17.Hello! Simon Burnton here, having just taken the baton from Richard Parkin. Still to come today:It’s Botswana first, Bahamas second and Jamaica, storming through on the home straight, third.Well, we’ve got one last track event for the day, but like the Australian men’s 4x400m relay team I’m hereby disqualifying myself in controversial circumstances and literally throwing the baton over to the more than capable hands of Simon Burnton over in the UK.Thanks for your company today, it’s been jam-packed action for most of the day so if you’re just waking now take the chance to scroll back through the morning’s events.But it’s goodbye from the Australia desk, as England, buoyed by their remarkable netball and relay teams, takes over!Into the final leg, and five teams are within touching distance. Botswana, though, are in the lead.Meanwhile, the men’s 4x400m final, the last track event of the Games, has just started.After an absolute thriller against Jamaica, a semi-final in which England started the final quarter four goals down, Tracey Neville’s side storm through to win!And I’ve had a whisper from elsewhere, there’s one heck of a result that’s just come through in the netball!We’re at the semi-final stage, and our two pairings are England v Jamaica and Australia v New Zealand.England and Jamaica are ranked third and fourth in the world respectively, but it’s been an impressive group stage showing from Tracey Neville’s women as they cruised through five wins, unscathed.Still, they were facing one of the absolute powerhouse shooters of world netball, Jhaniele Fowler-Reid, and to keep her quiet would be some effort.It started 15-all at the end of the first quarter before Jamaica powered away to lead by six at half-time. England pulled two points back in the third stanza with Helen Housby leading the way. They’re through to the final, England, where either Australia or New Zealand await! Phwoar, that’s a result.Okay, it’s Australia, Scotland, Botswana, India, Nigeria, England, Uganda, Jamaica to choose from, with the smart money apparently backing Jamaica, England and Nigeria here. Can the English continue their relay dominance? Let’s find out.And we’re off! It’s Nigeria with a storming first leg but she’s starting to fade, England also looks to have started well, as did Australia’s Anneliese Rubie.It’s Nigeria and Jamaica, with Australia, England and Botswana closing on the second leg. A bit of niggle on the third changeover as Jamaica moves to the lead. It’s Wells for Australia in third but she’s facing a challenge from England in fourth.Jamaica pulling away from Nigeria, those two are running clear from the field.England’s final runner is fading a touch, with Botswana’s final runner moving home at pace, we’ve got a real battle for third!It’s Jamaica gold, Nigeria silver, and Botswana third! What a power final leg from Amantle Montsho – the inidual 400m champion – to grab the medal for the south African nation!Around the grounds Okay, so as I mentioned earlier, there’s been a fair bit happening today – let’s go for a quick runaround and see what else has gone down.We’ve a gold for New Zealand in the men’s 91kg boxing, where David Nyika has defeated Australian Jason Whateley. Probably the Jacinda Ardern effect at work there too.Guyana’s Troy Doris has just bagged the gold in the men’s triple jump! What a hot hour this has been for less-heralded nations from the Caribbean (and upper South America)!He’s beaten out Dominica’s Yordanys Garcia, with Cameroon’s Marcel Mayack II grabbing bronze in an incredibly tight affair. 16.88m 16.86m and 16.80m the winning marks. It’s a game of millimetres is the ol’ triple jump.There’s a stack more happening, but crikey, if we’re not heading back to the track, because we’ve got women’s 4x400m relay action to take in. I’m bleeding from the fingers here. There really is a LOT going down this afternoon!Well, if ‘Namibia, Land of the Brave’ left you wanting more, strap yourself in because ladies and gentlemen – for the very first time in Commonwealth Games history we’re about to hear ‘Sons and Daughters of Saint Lucia’!A terrific performance from the veteran Levern Spencer – she missed her very first jump at 1.80m but ten jumps later has sailed over 1.95m to deliver the tiny Caribbean nation its first ever gold medal!England’s Morgan Lake pushed her all the way, clearing 1.93m for the silver, with Australia’s Nicola McDermott’s mark of 1.91m – a personal best – enough to grab the bronze. Canada fourth and Antigua and Barbuda fifth.I wonder what their anthem’s like. There’s been no love so far on the podium front in nine Commonwealth appearances, but maybe they can take inspiration from tiny Saint Lucia?Okay, we’re back on track. And again it’s Kenya who will look to lead the way in the men’s 1500m.The battle once again could be for the minor medals – with bronze or perhaps even silver very much up for grabs, but it will take something amazing to catch either Elijah Manangoi or Timothy Cheruiyot.Local hope Ryan Gregson could benefit from a parochial home crowd, but watch Scotland’s Chris O’Hare as well.We’re underway, it seems reasonably quick, the three Kenyans move to the head, but bronze medallist in the 800m Australia’s Luke Matthews looks to take his share of the pacemaking.Two laps to go and it’s Gregson well-placed on the should of the Kenyans, Scotland’s Jake Wightman also there or there abouts.We head for the bell, and the pace kicks up. Manangoi and Cheruiyot are off, Kumari Taki can’t stay with them. Here comes Wightman, he powers past Taki and onto the tail of the two Kenyans.Manangoi kicks again he’s got just enough – and Cheruiyot can’t match it!It’s Kenya one-two once more, but what a barnstorming finish from Wightman for bronze! England’s Grice takes fourth with India’s Jinson Johnson in fifth, with Gregson fading. A cracking finish though!We’ve got men’s triple jump underway and we’re getting to the pointy end in the women’s high jump, but a reminder for all those New Zealanders coming home from shift work or wireless-free deck parties, anxious to see how their women’s hockey team got on:Well, it was a 4-1 shellacking of overwhelming favourites Australia, in the New Zealand royal family was there in attendance to take it all in.Okay, not technical royalty, but PM Jacinda Ardern, ‘first man’ Clarke Gayford and ‘first baby’ (not pictured) must have rubbed some of their sparkle off as the Black Sticks put on an absolute showing. A great result – watch again later tonight as these two rivals square off once more in the men’s gold medal match.And while track was taking centre stage, field was hotting up in the men’s javelin.We touched earlier with local hope Hamish Peacock starting strongly. I should have waited a few more throws, because India’s Neeraj Chopra then came out and threw a 85.50m to open! Cripes.He’s got the boyish good looks of a Bollywood star and the pace on the runway of a fast bowler, and he’s got the local crowd eating from his hand. He is launching himself with every throw, as he strains to pack as much power as conceivable into his throw he ends up almost with a front cartwheel I don’t know the technical merit of this, but sheesh it’s effective.Grenada’s Anderson Peters has launched a 82.20m thunderbolt with his second effort. Will he be the man to reel in Chopra?Peacock fires his fourth effort and the crowd responds! Terrific consistency with all four throws between 75-81m, but this one goes better – 82.59m and he moves into silver medal position.And as if to respond instantly, look at this from Chopra. It flies, he flies – and it’s beyond the gold medal best. 86.47m – they won’t be beating this!India gold, Australia silver, Grenada bronze. He’s got an arm like a traction engine!I’ll not lie to you, good people of the Commonwealth, it’s a cracking pace we’re setting on day 10. It feels almost like that high school essay you leave until the night before, because they are really cramming in the events up here on the GC today.I’ll have updates for you shortly from table tennis and shooting where more golds have dropped, and also where we’re at in the various field events, but now: women’s 5000m.We’ve just got underway, which by my reckoning gives me about 14 minutes to make up some stats for you.Okay, the daylight favourite here is Kenya’s Hellen Obiri, who learned track devotees will recall is our 2017 World Champion and 2016 Rio Games silver medallist.It’s a gentle pace set over the first few laps which might play into the Kenyan’s hands. Also a medal prospect is Obiri’s compatriot Margaret Kipkemboi, with Scotland’s duo of Eilish McColgan and Steph Twell also in the mix. Eloise Wellings is the best of the locals and one of only five runners here who has dropped a sub-15 previously.We’re around 2km in and it’s a slow pace thus far, projected to be c.16 minutes, but I imagine it will come down as we get to the business end. It’s the three Kenyans leading, with Twell and two Australians at the head of it.There’s a slight break now with those six opening up with four more on the tail and an athlete from New Zealand attempting to bridge the gap. Our medals should come from these 11. Five laps to go.And here’s our first significant acceleration – and it’s the two Kenyans, Kipkemboi and Obiri who have put distance between themselves and the chasing field. They’re rotating the pace-making, and it’s difficult to see who has the better form.Uganda’s Juliet Chekwel has made a dash from the back to move into bronze medal position with two laps to go. England’s Laura Weightman has moved into fourth, Australia’s Celia Sullohern also there with Wellings and Eva Cherono also a threat for bronze. So we’ve two races within races – who gets gold and who gets bronze.We’ve about 300m to run, and here goes Obiri! She kicks again, and this time Kipkemboi can’t match her! It’s a Kenyan one-two, but what a storming finish here from Weightman. She’s come from the clouds for the bronze. Kenya, Kenya, England for the medals!And if you love a new anthem – run over to the Oxenford Studios right now where the brass band is banging out Namibia’s ditty, because the man called Jonas (twice) has done it! A brave showing from the Canadian Blumenfeld, such mental toughness and resilience in the face of frankly, a pounding, but he settles for silver in the men’s 64kg category.And having waited 12 years to hear that anthem I can happily report – it’s not a banger.Why can’t we have Finland at the Commonwealth Games? He knew how to get the toes tapping did ol’ Sibelius.. Still, a happy mixup from Advance Australia Fair.Our roving correspondent Mike Hytner has been taking in all today’s action live from the Gold Coast, sloping around with a keen eye and hat marked ‘press’ – here’s his view of the cycling road race (the rumble in Currumbin?) and the infamous upset at the Hockeydome:Treat yourself and take a read, I hear it’s a big f*cking deal.Fun fact o’clock – if you thought it a surprise that England would do the double over Jamaica in the 4x100m relays, then let us take a cursory walk down history lane.So, there’s no doing these things by halves it seems, as the pendulum swings back to England in this remarkable two-horse relay race history. So it’s Jamaica, Australia, Ghana, Cameroon, England, Nigeria, The Bahamas and Trinidad and Tobago to choose from.Some sprint royalty here, but Jamaica find themselves with the unlikely draw of lane 1, given there were no qualifiers for this event and thus a random draw. Will it hamper Elaine Thompson and friends?We’re underway, Asher-Smith powering England away, Jamaica really off the pace early on, we’ve got a baton drop, I think it was Australia, Jamaica with a power of work to do here – they turn for the fourth leg and it’s the sprint queen vs the long jumper, Thompson v Ugen, she’s catching, she’s powering, the stadium holds it’s breath.. but England survive!Gold to England, silver to Jamaica and bronze to Nigeria, daylight fourth as Australia stumble on fourth change! England go the double! Remarkable.A fine opening throw from Australian Hamish Peacock not quite the dramatic entrance we saw from Kathryn Mitchell who came and destroyed the entire field with her first Games record effort in the women’s competition. Still, a very tidy mark of 75.95m to get us underway.We’ve also got women’s high jump happening, where the bar has started at 1.60m. A lovely clearance from Swaziland’s Nonhlanhla Seyama at 1.65m among others as we power through the early stages. Many still sitting out and awaiting a higher bar.We’re back to the track for now though, as we prepare for the women’s 4x100m final. Stand by.First medal to be determined on the track today as Jamaica looks to seek amends for that 100m upset by South Africa.They’re out quickly but there’s a baton drop on the second leg, was it Nigeria?Australia and England are right in the mix here, but it’s a very fast finish from South Africa and Jamaica. It was England and Australia one-two on the home straight but look at this final leg from Simbine and also Blake. They’ve mowed Josh Clarke down for second, will they catch England?! They hold on! England grab gold, South Africa silver, Jamaica bronze, and Australia fourth! Simbine has beaten Blake again, wowee.Redemption for Zharnel Hughes – disqualified after seemingly winning gold in the 200m – but he’s got his Commonwealth gold. What a finish!We’ve got live results coming in from the men’s boxing as well, where once more it’s the podium nations that are dominating. Australian Harry Garside has continued his fine run winning gold for the host nation in the men’s 60kg ision over India’s Manish Kaushik, India then turning table with gold in the men’s 52kg for Gaurav Solanki, before England returned the favour, relegating India to silver in the men’s \u0026lt49kg with Galal Yafai emerging triumphant.We’re just in time to see my boy Jonas Jonas (see yesterday) of Namibia trade blows with Canada’s Thomas Blumenfeld. Can he win his nation’s first Games medal since Melbourne 2006?He’s got a height and reach advantage on the Canadian, and pound for pound he looks the stronger but you can’t fault the tenacity of Blumenfeld he’s got a welt across his left eye but he continues to come at his taller opponent.We’ve just finished the second round, and Blumenfeld has been deducted a point for losing his mouthguard mid-bout for the third time. Was it deliberate, to snatch a breather? Who could say. Seems a bizarre way to lose if this one ends up going down to the wire.We’ll revisit this, as the track and field has begun over at Carrara Stadium.Well if you’re just joining us, there’s an absolute boilover unfolding in the women’s hockey – we’re deep in the fourth quarter and it appears that New Zealand are cruising home to an emphatic win over hosts Australia, it’s 4-1!Australia you’ll remember were yet to concede even a goal throughout their entire campaign, but it’s the Black Sticks who have blown them away with a goal in the second quarter, and two more in the third to run out to a commanding lead.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern watches from the stand about to witness New Zealand claim their first ever Commonwealth gold don’t forget the Australian team have won this event at three consecutive Games in fact you’d have to go back to 2002 for the last time anyone beat them!Shiloh Gloyn got the opener with around 28 minutes played, before a fine reverse tomahawk off the floor from Rose Keddell made it 2-0 as Australia failed to clear their lines following a penalty corner.Olivia Merry stretched the advantage to three with another strike from a penalty corner, before Australia threw caution to the wind in a dramatic last quarter, employing a fly keeper for NINE minutes as they chased the remarkable. Glasgow topscorer Jodie Henry pulled one back, but it wasn’t to be. A well-deserved victory to New Zealand – will that inspire their men’s team who lock horns with Australia once more later today? Phwoar, imagine that.It’s been a strong morning for the nations already astride the podium with Australia, England and India grabbing the golds on offer.In the women’s cycling road race it was a terrific team performance from Australia whose six riders set and controlled the pace for most of the 112km course at Currumbin to allow Chloe Hosking to grab the gold ahead of New Zealand’s Georgia Williams and Wales’ Danielle Rowe. Hosking acknowledged the support of her team in a pretty honest and raw interview post race:There’s been shooting gold for England as David Luckman has won the Queen’s Prize Inidual ahead of compatriot Parag Patel with the bronze and Australian Jim Bailey taking silver. Look, I’ll level with you entirely here, I have no idea how that event works – shooting aficionados feel free to set me straight on that front via email or twitter if you’re not learning, you’re not living.The women’s boxing gold medal bouts are underway and local favourite Anja Stridsman has delighted the home fans at packed into the Oxenford Studios, with an unanimous victory in the women’s 60kg ision. England’s Lisa Whiteside and India’s Mery Kom have also been victorious in the 51kg and \u0026lt48kg isions, with Northern Ireland settling for a brace of silvers.But to live action now, and uhoh – we’ve got something special unfolding in the hockey.Selamat datang, namaste, jambo! It’s the penultimate day of events in the Gold Coast and we’ve still plenty in store.If you missed last night, there was a very unexpected celebration of one of Australia’s lawn bowlers went ‘beast mode’, Katarina Johnson-Thompson conquered fatigue to back up her Birmingham exploits and women’s rugby sevens kicked off in fine fettle. Here’s what’s still to come on day 10. Remember, all times are local – the Gold Coast is GMT +10:00 and EST +14:00.We’ve got a busy day-programme of athletics today, with women’s high jump leaping into action from 2.25pm (local), men’s javelin and triple jump, 4x100m relays, and women’s 5000m. From about 4pm it’s the men’s 1500m and then we’re into 4x400m relays – so an absolute bumper session with nine gold on the line.We’ve got England v Jamaica in the netball semi-final from 3pm, and men’s trap shooting shortly thereafter, there’s medals in the table tennis and wrestling and then around 5pm a ding-dong in the netball as perennial rivals Australia and New Zealand duke it out.There are medals up for grabs in the badminton, more rugby sevens action – I hope you’ve told family you’re at work and work you’re hanging out with family, because today is going to require some serious concentration!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b60c83599c8ad4816d23e239288f8a73993e903c/0_174_5161_3098/master/5161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14ed763f78e0e9679988f0d84a70f503 1240w","title":"secret teacher my students know all about exams but little of the wider world","story":"We’re so focused on tests that we’re neglecting to expose pupils to ideas and experiences beyond the classroomDo I need a passport to get to Liverpool? What’s a postcard? Is Cornwall real? These are all questions I’ve been asked by (often bright) GCSE students that wouldn’t be out of place in a “10 hilarious questions asked by kids” listicle. For me, though, they reveal pupils’ lack of exposure to activities and concepts outside their everyday lives.I teach in a town with high levels of poverty and disadvantage. School trips are not only prohibitively expensive (for the school and for parents) but take time away from the core curriculum. With teachers under enormous pressure to deliver on test results, spending hours organising learning experiences that can’t easily be measured isn’t an appealing prospect. You can’t shoehorn in three assessment for learning episodes if students are running around a farm.You might expect this lack of experience to affect subjects like geography, but even in English the impact is huge. Poems, especially, often rely on natural imagery to which my students haven’t been exposed. Take the line from a GCSE set poem that describes a son becoming independent from his father “like a winged seed loosened from its parent stem”. I had to bring in plants to demonstrate what a stem was. Another poem depicts a frightened woman “flying like a hare”. My students (quite reasonably, they thought) pointed out that hair doesn’t fly.These are the pupils who feel comfortable speaking up. How many children sit silently baffled when we read a poem about swans but feel too self-conscious to ask what a swan is?When every other word has to be looked up or explained, there is an additional cognitive burden for the most disadvantaged students. It’s like studying an entire literature syllabus in a foreign language – while native speakers spot and analyse the subtleties of the text, my bottom set struggles even to make sense of the surface meanings.What they are familiar with is the pressure to pass exams. But without a broad range of experiences, there are barriers here too. Exams often discriminate against working class students through the texts chosen for comprehension tasks. Students can be thrown by extracts on kayaking or mountaineering – middle class entrants, who may have been on adventure holidays with their families, will be in their element. Students who lack those reference points can be put off further study. They come to believe it’s not for them. I’ve also seen how my students’ limited understanding of the world translates to behaviour outside school. Many pupils have never left the town where they were born. Their skewed views of urban life can be dangerous – one student visiting a city for the first time took a knife with them for protection. Schools should be tasked with playing some part in closing this experience gap but are hamstrung by other pressing measures of accountability. We’re so focused on getting through the whole of Macbeth in six weeks that music lessons and trips seem frivolous. The irony is that this attitude puts the neediest children on the back foot academically.I believe that children should, from a young age, have experience of farms, gardens, concerts, football matches and universities. They should visit cities, woodlands and the beach. The need is greater after years of austerity that has led to parents (saddled with the bedroom tax or having their universal credit cut) choosing between heating and food. For them, a theatre trip isn’t an option. Schools should have the resources – in money and time – to step in. Leaders, inspectors and policymakers need to create conditions where it’s not only possible but expected to provide students with rich, first-hand experiences of the world outside the classroom. Then we can spend our time getting to the beating heart of a poem, rather than arguing about whether a pony is a mythical creature.Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach, like us on Facebook, and join theGuardian Teacher Network the latest articles direct to your inboxLooking for a teaching job?

The judge rejected a similar claim brought by a second businessman who was jailed for a more serious offence. The claimant who lost, referred to only as NT1 for legal reasons, was convicted of conspiracy to account falsely in the late 1990s the claimant who won, known as NT2, was convicted more than 10 years ago of conspiracy to intercept communications. NT1 was jailed for four years, while NT2 was jailed for six months.Granting an appeal in the case of NT1, the judge added: “It is quite likely that there will be more claims of this kind, and the fact that NT2 has succeeded is likely to reinforce that.”Both men demanded that Google remove search results mentioning the cases for which they were convicted. These include links to web pages published by a national newspaper and other media. Google refused their request and the men took the company to the high court.The decision in NT2’s favour could have implications for other convicted criminals and those who want embarrassing stories about them erased from the web. Warby ruled out any damages payment, however.Explaining his decision, the judge said NT1 continued to mislead the public, whereas NT2 had shown remorse. He also took into account the submission that NT2’s conviction did not concern actions taken by him in relation to “consumers, customers or investors”, but rather in relation to the invasion of privacy of third parties.He said his key conclusion in relation to NT2’s claim was that “the crime and punishment information has become out of date, irrelevant and of no sufficient legitimate interest to users of Google search to justify its continued availability”. In the case of NT1, however, the judge was scathing about the claimant’s position since leaving prison. “He has not accepted his guilt, has misled the public and this court, and shows no remorse over any of these matters,” he said.“He remains in business, and the information serves the purpose of minimising the risk that he will continue to mislead, as he has in the past. Delisting would not erase the information from the record altogether, but it would make it much harder to find.”In 2014 the European court of justice (ECJ) ruled that “irrelevant” and outdated data should be erased on request. Since then, Google has received requests to remove at least 2.4m links from search results. Search engine firms can reject applications if they believe the public interest in accessing the information outweighs a right to privacy.At a high court hearing in February, Hugh Tomlinson QC, representing NT1, told the high court that the visibility of the articles on the search engine caused “distress and upset” to his client.Tomlinson, who is also chairman of the press regulation campaign group Hacked Off, told the court the businessman was not a public figure and now made a living from commercial lending and funding a property developer.“Before anyone meets a new person these days they Google them,” Tomlinson said. He added that many people engaged in misdeeds when they were young and if the misdeeds were constantly brought to the attention of others then they would permanently have a negative effect.NT1’s conviction was now spent, Tomlinson continued, and the law was designed to allow for the rehabilitation of offenders so they could go on to lead normal lives.But Antony White QC, representing Google, argued the ECJ’s “right to be forgotten” ruling was “not a right to rewrite history or ... tailor your past if that’s what this claimant would like to use it for”.White said the business malpractice that gave rise to NT1’s conviction was “serious and sustained”.NT2, in a separate hearing, also argued that his conviction was legally spent and he therefore had a right to be forgotten. Google resisted taking down search results linking to articles including reports on his financial affairs, his conviction and interviews given by him several years later containing his account of the circumstances surrounding his conviction.A Google spokesperson said: “We work hard to comply with the right to be forgotten, but we take great care not to remove search results that are in the public interest and will defend the public’s right to access lawful information. We are pleased that the court recognised our efforts in this area, and we will respect the judgments they have made in this case.”"},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

Though it’s a few hundred miles from the ocean, you’ll still find beaches, some of which are home to a vibrant daytime party scene. Nearby there are stunning natural wonders — mountains, lakes and hiking trails – perfect for all kinds of recreational activities.

But at the same time, we must respect neighbours’ opinions.”Klimt said the work would stay up for a short while so everyone interested could experience it. Although some people had welcomed the penis as an “important part of the debate about sexuality, body and gender”, others – especially neighbours – had “received it less well and perceived it as offensive”, she said. Atrium Ljungberg has allowed a collective of local artists, Kollektivet Livet, free rein to decorate the apartment block wall as it sees fit since 2008. The murals usually stay in place for at least six months before a new one is commissioned.Falkholt said at the unveiling that she hoped her blue penis would be better received in Stockholm than a similar pink one was when it appeared on the side of an apartment building in Manhattan’s Lower East Side in December. The New York work was painted over within three days instead of the intended three weeks after similar complaints from locals. But Falkholt said on Wednesday she thought the reaction in her native Sweden would be different. “I think perhaps it will be allowed to remain here, people will get the message and let it take its place in the debate,” she said. “I think there’s more intellectual space to discuss the subject, in a nuanced way.” She said she liked to think of the Stockholm painting – titled Fuck the World – as “a reincarnation”. Falkholt could not be reached for comment on Friday.

Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSyrian air defenses responded to the joint strikes by the United States, France and Britain. Photograph: SANAAPThe US, UK and France have launched air strikes against what they allege are Syrian chemical weapons facilities in response to chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb a week ago.The Pentagon said the air strikes, which began at 4am Syrian time (2am GMT), involved planes and ship-launched missiles, more than 100 projectiles in all.Officials named three targets: a scientific research centre in Damascus, a chemical weapons storage facility west of Homs, and another storage site and command post nearby.“Right now, we have no additional attacks planned” the US defence secretary, James Mattis, said. “This is a one-time shot.”However, in a televised address from the White House earlier to announce the strikes, Donald Trump said the US and its allies would strike again if there were more chemical weapons attacks by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.“We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents,” he said.Referring to last Saturday’s chemical weapons attack reported to have killed over 70 people, Trump said.“These are not actions of a man, they are crimes of a monster instead.”After Trump finished his seven-minute address, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron made separate announcements of British and French participation, stressing that the strikes were limited to Syrian regime chemical facilities, and had no wider goals.May said there was no alternative to the action the three countries were taking.Explosions were reported in Damascus moments after Trump’s address. Later a Syrian official said all sites had been evacuated “days ago” after a warning from Russia.The Russian ambassador to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, issued a statement threatening “consequences”.“A pre-designed scenario is being implemented,” Antonov’s statement said. “Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris.”None of the air strikes hit zones where Russian air defence systems protect the Russian bases of Tartus and Hmeimim, Russian news agencies cited the ministry of defence as saying.The Syrian military its air defences brought down most of the missiles launched during what it called a campaign of “tripartite aggression”. It said missiles targeting a military installation near Homs were disrupted and exploded, injuring three civilians, the first allegation of civilian casualties from the strikes.The Pentagon said in the immediate aftermath of the strikes that while there had been some Syrian air defence fire, it was not clear whether Russian air defences in Syria had gone into action.The attack came on the eve of a planned visit by inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to the site of last week’s chemical weapons attacks, the Damascus suburb of Douma. The US, UK and France had announced they had reached their own conclusion that the Syrian regime was responsible, an accusation denied by Damascus and Russia, which claimed on Friday the attack had been staged by British intelligence.The White House produced a summary of the evidence it said pointed to the regime’s responsibility for the Douma attack. It said that regime helicopters were seen by witnesses hovering over the area of the attack on 7 April, dropping barrel bombs. Remnants of the barrel bombs looked like “chlorine barrel bombs from past attacks”. It said that the victims showed symptoms of both chlorine and sarin poisoning.The White House assessment also claimed there was “reliable information indicating coordination between Syrian military officials before the attack.”?We have sent a clear message?Mattis, who had said on Thursday that the US was still looking at the evidence, insisted on Friday night that he was “absolutely confident” that the regime was responsible for use of poison gas in Douma. He said there was clear evidence of the use of chlorine, but “we are not certain about sarin right now”.Mattis said that the “Assad regime clearly did not get the message last year” when the US launched a Tomahawk missile strike at a desert airbase following a poison gas attack in April 2017. On that occasion, 57 missiles were fired. Mattis said slightly more than double that total were used in the airstrikes overnight.“This time, our allies and we have struck harder,” the defence secretary said. “Together we have sent a clear message to Assad and his murderous lieutenants that they should not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable.”Trump said the Douma attack was “a significant escalation tripartite aggression in in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime.” He noted that establishing deterrence against use of such weapons represented “a vital national security interest of the US”.Macron confirmed that France was involved in the air strikes, saying the French role would be limited to Syria’s chemical weapons facilities.“We cannot tolerate the recurring use of chemical weapons, which is an immediate danger for the Syrian people and our collective security,” a statement from the Elysee presidential office said.In London, Theresa May issued a statement about British participation in the air strikes.“This evening I have authorised British armed forces to conduct co-ordinated and targeted strikes to degrade the Syrian Regime’s chemical weapons capability and deter their use,” the prime minister said in a written statement from Downing Street.Like Trump a few minutes earlier, May stressed that the aims of the intervention were limited to stopping chemical weapons use, for humanitarian reasons, and to uphold the international norm outlawing chemical weapon use.“We have sought to use every possible diplomatic channel to achieve this.But our efforts have been repeatedly thwarted,” May said, pointing to a Russian veto at the UN security council on a proposal to set up a new investigative body for chemical weapons incidents in Syria.“So there is no practicable alternative to the use of force to degrade and deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime. This is not about intervening in a civil war. It is not about regime change.”Trump addressed some of his remarks to the Syrian regime’s principal external backers, Russia and Iran.“What kind of nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of men, women and children?” he asked. “Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path or join civilised nations as a force for peace.”The decision to launch air strikes in response to last Saturday’s chemical weapons attack in a rebel-held district of Damascus was fraught with risks. There are Russian and Iranian forces in bases across Syrian and substantial Russian air defences in the west of the country. Russian officials had threatened to use those defences.The US defence secretary, James Mattis, had expressed concerns that air strikes could lead a situation “escalating out of control”. The US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Joseph Dunford, said that the targets had been chosen very carefully.As light dawned in Damascus on Saturday, hundreds of Syrians gathered at landmark squares, honking their car horns, flashing victory signs and waving Syrian, Russian and Iranian flags in scenes of defiance. “We are your men, Bashar,” they shouted.Syrian state TV broadcast live from Omayyad square where a large crowd of civilians mixed with men in uniforms, including an actor, lawmakers and other figures. “Good morning steadfastness,” one broadcaster said.“Good souls will not be humiliated,” Syria’s presidency tweeted after the airstrikes began. Syrian state media also released a short video apparently showingBashar al-Assad arriving to work at the presidential palace.Read full coverage of events hereThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition. In a malnourished population the disease severity and duration of an infectious disease can be much greater.”Researchers are now conducting a follow-up study to assess whether the nutritional situation has changed.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesComment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

The country’s biggest total came four years in Glasgow when, as hosts, the team won 53 medals.However, it is already well ahead of its best previous overseas medal haul of 29, in Melbourne in 2006.Syria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Mr McCabe says that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood, he went back and tried to correct them.His lawyer says the inspector general unfairly tried to conclude its work before Mr McCabe could retire with a full pension.The report gave additional fodder for President Donald Trump\u0027s public attacks on Mr McCabe.On Friday night, the president tweeted: \u0026quotDOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster. He LIED! LIED! LIED! McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!! No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes!\u0026quotJames Comey, the former FBI director whose new book paints a damning portrait of Donald TrumpThe president has made a concerted and Twitter-driven effort to impugn Mr McCabe as a partisan hack, accusing him of covering up unspecified \u0026quotlies and corruption\u0026quot at the FBI and calling his firing a \u0026quotgreat day for Democracy.\u0026quotMr McCabe has fired back, saying his dismissal was part of the Trump administration\u0027s \u0026quotongoing war\u0026quot on the FBI and special counsel Robert Mueller\u0027s Russia investigation.The report was sent to congressional committees and obtained by The Associated Press.The inspector general\u0027s finding led FBI disciplinary officials to recommend that the Justice Department fire Mr McCabe.Donald Trump, the US president, frequently criticised Mr McCabe before his firingAttorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed him last month two days before his scheduled retirement for what he described as a lack of candor.Mr McCabe also has said he believes he was singled out because of the \u0026quotrole I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath\u0026quot of Mr Comey\u0027s firing.To support this, Mr McCabe has noted that the inspector general\u0027s investigation into him was accelerated after he told congressional investigators that he could corroborate Mr Comey\u0027s accounts of his conversations with Trump.Mr McCabe, who is close to Comey, could be an important witness for Mueller, who is investigating Trump for possible obstruction of justice, including his motivation for firing Mr Comey in May 2017.The Associated Press has also confirmed that Mr McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with the president and they have been provided to the special counsel\u0027s office.Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest news\u0026#39An unequivocal message\u0026#39: How the world reacted to the Syrian airstrikesJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: On this day in 1865: John Wilkes Booth shoots Abraham Lincoln at Ford\u0026#39s Theatre, WashingtonComment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Pictured is an RAF Tornado GR4 landing at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus, which could be deployed against the Syrian governmentAir strikes carried out by the US, UK and France against the Syrian regime have been welcomed by their Western allies.President Donald Trump on Friday night addressed the American people to announce that military action had been taken in Syria, with the support of Britain and France.Three targets were chosen, to strike at the heart of a regime held culpable by the West for a chemical gas attack in a suburb of Damascus last week, that killed more than 70 people and injured dozens more.Theresa May, the Prime Minister, insisted that the strikes were \u0026quotlimited\u0026quot and were not intended to drive regime change.Here is how the world reacted:Iran warned of \u0026quotregional consequences\u0026quot following the wave of punitive strikes in Syria.\u0026quotThe United States and its allies have no proof and, without even waiting for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to take a position, have carried out this military attack,\u0026quot said the foreign ministry in a statement.They \u0026quotare responsible for the regional consequences of this adventurist action,\u0026quot it added.Iran is the key backer alongside Russia of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, providing military advisors and \u0026quotvolunteer\u0026quot ground forces.Tehran officials have said Western powers are using last week\u0027s alleged chemical attack on a rebel-held stronghold as an excuse to undermine the Syrian government\u0027s recent successes on the battlefield.Israel said in response to the American-led strike in Syria that the Middle Eastern country\u0027s \u0026quotmurderous actions\u0026quot had put it in danger.An official said in a statement that Mr Trump made clear last year that the use of chemical weapons was a red line not to be crossed.Damascus sky lights up with service to air missile fire as the U.S. launches an attack on Syria targeting different parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, Syria, early Saturday, April 14, 2018He said the overnight operation carried out by the United States, France and Britain followed that example. The official said that \u0026quotSyria continues to carry out murderous actions and be a base for these actions and others, including Iran\u0027s, that put its territory, forces and leadership in peril.\u0026quotThe official spoke anonymously according to protocol. There has been no other official Israeli response yet.Israel has issued several stern warnings of late about Iran\u0027s increased involvement along its border in Syria in Lebanon.Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, has ruled out Canadian participation in the strikes but said that Canada supports the decision by its allies in the US, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotCanada condemns in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in last week\u0027s attack in eastern Ghouta, Syria,\u0026quot said Mr Trudeau, in a statement issued from Lima, Peru, where he is attending the Summit of the Americas.\u0026quotCanada supports the decision by the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to take action to degrade the Assad regime\u0027s ability to launch chemical weapons attacks against its own people.\u0026quotWe will continue to work with our international partners to further investigate the use of chemical weapons in Syria. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\u0026quotEarlier on Friday, Canada became the latest country to lay the blame for a deadly chemical-weapons attack in Syria last week at Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s doorstep, despite Russian suggestions to the contrary.\u0026quotWhen it comes to this use of chemical weapons, it is clear to Canada that chemical weapons were used and that they were used by the Assad regime,\u0026quot said Chrystia Freeland, Canadian foreign minister.Australia, a staunch ally of the US and a member of the Five Eyes security alliance, was not a part of the attacks on Damascus and Homs, but issued a statement lending its support to the coalition’s actions.Malcolm Turnbull, the prime minister, said in a statement jointly issued with the foreign and defence ministers: “The use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, under any circumstances is illegal and utterly reprehensible.“The Assad regime must not be allowed to commit such crimes with impunity.”Mr Turnbull said the strikes were “a calibrated, proportionate and targeted response”.“They send an unequivocal message to the Assad regime and its backers, Russia and Iran, that the use of chemical weapons will not be tolerated.”The head of Nato expressed his support for Western strikes in Syria.Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement: \u0026quotI support the actions taken by the United States, the United Kingdom and France.\u0026quotThis will reduce the regime\u0027s ability to further attack the people of Syria with chemical weapons.\u0026quotUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday called for restraint and for countries to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation in Syria after the United States, France and Britain carried out strikes.Guterres delayed a planned trip to Saudi Arabia to deal with the aftermath of the military action.\u0026quotI urge all member states to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate the situation and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people,\u0026quot Guterres said in a statement.\u0026quotAny use of chemical weapons is abhorrent. The suffering it causes is horrendous,\u0026quot Guterres said.The UN chief said it was important to act in line with the UN charter and international law.He urged the UN Security Council to agree on establishing an inquiry that would identify the perpetrators of chemical attacks.European Council president Donald Tusk said the European Union would stand with its allies \u0026quoton the side of justice\u0026quot.\u0026quotStrikes by US, France and UK make it clear that Syrian regime together with Russia \u0026amp Iran cannot continue this human tragedy, at least not without cost,\u0026quot he wrote on Twitter.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU commission, said the use of chemical weapons was \u0026quotunacceptable in any circumstances\u0026quot:Please review our commenting policySyria airstrikes: America, Britain and France target Assad\u0026#39s chemical facilities in aerial barrage - latest newsJeremy Corbyn condemns Syria strikes as \u0026#39legally questionable\u0026#39Comment: China or North Korea: Who has the prettiest first lady?

Fourteen days of strikes have already hit 65 universities since 22 February.But members of the UCU voted to call off more action after bosses at Universities UK agreed a joint panel would be set up to reassess the pension issue.The news was welcomed by the National Union of Students (NUS), with estimates suggesting up to 1 million students were affected by previous walkouts.Shakira Martin, NUS president, said: “We are pleased to see a deal has been reached.

Universities UK had said the alterations would help make up a £6bn deficit.But, with the proposals now dropped, members of the UCU voted almost two to one to stop more walkouts and instead reopen negotiations. There was a record 63.5 per cent turn out, the union said.Sally Hunt, UCU general secretary, said: “The union has come a very long way since January when it seemed that the employers’ proposals for a defined contribution pension were to be imposed.“Now we have agreement to move forward jointly, looking again at the USS valuation alongside a commitment from the employers to a guaranteed, defined benefit scheme.”And she added: “We hope this important agreement will hearten workers across the UK fighting to defend their pension rights and was won through the amazing strike action of UCU members.“UCU has more work to do to ensure that the agreement delivers the security in retirement that university staff deserve.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The regulations will then be allowed to expire.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIndian activists gather to show support for the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal, who is on a hunger strike against the alleged rapes in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi, India.

I was born here, so I just assumed that I was British. I felt disheartened and confused about who I was. I’d believed one thing for my whole life and all of a sudden it was a lie.”Out of frustration, Ms Kaali posted a status on Facebook about what had happened. She received a flurry of responses from people saying they were shocked and surprised.“They didn’t know this was a thing that happened they always knew me as being British,” she said.Friends persuaded her to create a GoFundMe petition to raise funds for her citizenship application, and within the first 20 hours she had raised half the money needed. She has now reached the target.British-born man receives Home Office letter ordering him to leave UK“It’s incredible and I’m so thankful, but for me it doesn’t really end there. There is an issue in terms of what they class someone as British is – it’s very vague. It’s a case of your parents’ status, and there are a lot of boxes you need to tick to apply,” she said.“It says you have to have lived here up until you were 10 years old, you have to have not left the country for more than five years, and the last one is you have to be of ‘good character’. “It almost feels like that’s a sneakily vague thing they put in there so they can decide at their own discretion who they deem to be British or not.”Ms Kaali now hopes to launch a petition to change the rules around applying for British citizenship, and is in the process of speaking to lawyers and other experts to propose a viable alternative.She added: “I don’t feel like it’s enough to just stop here knowing that so many people are in a similar situation. Not only do you have to meet that criteria but you have to pay the ridiculous funds as well. Not every has access to those kind of funds.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

He should have had the decency to refer himself rather than sweep this under the carpet.”The health secretary said his failure to declare a business interest with both Companies House and the parliamentary register of MPs interests was down to “honest administrative mistakes” and that he did not gain financially as a result.A spokeswoman for Mr Hunt said: “These were honest administrative mistakes which have already been rectified.“Jeremy’s accountant made an error in the Companies House filing which was a genuine oversight.“With respect to ministerial and parliamentary declarations, the Cabinet Office are clear that there has been no breach of the ministerial code.“Jeremy declared the interest to them after the company was set up.“They advised that, as it was a shell company with no assets or value, it should only be registered when it became operational.“As such, Jeremy presumed the same rules applied to parliamentary declarations.“Although there was no personal gain involved, Jeremy accepts these mistakes are his responsibility and has apologised to the parliamentary authorities.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesEngland\u0027s Katarina Johnson-Thompson celebrates after winning the heptathlon with compatriot and bronze medal winner Niamh Emerson during the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in Australia.Quaker Alan Pinch makes tea for passers-by as he holds a protest in Manchester against UK military intervention in SyriaA man pulls the flowers down from a fence opposite the house of Richard Osborn-Brooks in South Park Crescent in Hither Green, London.

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This line was repeated several times on state television broadcasts.  But, Mr Kosachyov added, now was “not a time for emotions.” Russia’s reaction should instead be guided “by professional evaluation of military specialists”Russia warns of \u0027consequences\u0027 for US-led strikesThose military specialists seemed to put clear blue water between Russia and the coalition operation. In statements that will reassure Washington — which emphasised targets had been chosen away from Russian infrastructure — the Russian Ministry of Defence said it had consciously not engaged its own defence systems. “None of the missiles landed in any of the areas under the responsibility of Russian air defence systems in Tartus and Khmeimime, it said in a statement. Syrian sources also emphasised that Russia had warned them in advance of the likelihood of air attacks, and had evacuated all military installations. According to Reuters, their air defences managed to shoot down a third of the coalition missiles — a much better success rate than 2017 Shayrat missile strike, when almost all of 59 US Tomahawk missiles landed.  Maria Zakharova, the excitable spokesperson of Russia’s Foreign Ministry said that the West “claimed “moral leadership” but “had struck a blow to the capital of a sovereign state.” The coalition had, she said, had attacked “just at a time when Syria held the chance of a peaceful future.” Russia’s ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov also said that “actions would not be without consequences.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIndian activists gather to show support for the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women Swati Maliwal, who is on a hunger strike against the alleged rapes in Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, in New Delhi, India.
