At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ... Never click on a link in the email or attachment, and refuse any request for money or details. Scan any suspicious text or email for clues.

As all attention is focused on Covid-19, plans have been submitted for a gargantuan new arena, conference centre and hotel complex on the banks of the River Tyne, which could change the face of Newcastle-Gateshead for ever. The timing is striking. Just as the future of conferences and other mass events is being called into question, the developers are pressing ahead with one of the biggest people magnets the north-east has ever seen.Billed as bringing “another landmark destination” to Gateshead Quays, the £260m project will occupy one of the most prominent sites in the region, slap bang between the Sage concert venue and the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art. Designed by arena specialist HOK, with AHR architects, the scheme is set to bring a 12,500-seat arena, 300-room hotel and three vast exhibition halls to the 10-acre waterside site, along with shops and restaurants, all packed inside a crumpled mishmash of competing structures. It looks like the compromised result of design-by-committee, employing a plethora of materials and awkward angles in a vain attempt to break up the lumpen mass. Public reaction has been caustic. “They’re proposing to build something from scratch that looks like the result of multiple awkward extensions to a 1970s shopping centre,” commented one Twitter user. Another was more damning: “What is this bollocks – Dignitas North East?”The project is all the more disappointing given the time it has taken to get this far. For almost two decades, the heart of Gateshead’s waterfront has been scarred by a great windswept wasteland. On one side stands the Sage, a isive building – variously compared to a metallic peanut and a swollen slug – but one that seems to unite all opinions with its world-class acoustics. It was designed by Norman Foster in the early 2000s, at around the same time that he was conjuring vanity monuments for central Asian autocrats, and it has always seemed cast adrift, marooned up a slope on the edge of a car park.Across the other side of the windswept tarmac expanse, down several flights of stairs, across a road and down yet more steps, stands the Baltic, a 1950s flour mill transformed into a gallery in the Tate Modern mould, opened in 2002. Together with the winking Millennium Bridge, which cleverly pivots to let boat traffic through, these projects were an impressive symbol of Gateshead’s culture-led regeneration programme during the New Labour years – only let down by the great unplanned mess between them.“We always held it up as an example for our students,” says Mark Tewdwr-Jones, professor of town planning at Newcastle University, “of how not to do planning. That site has been a cause célèbre for planning disasters.”While the Newcastle side of the river was subject to a Terry Farrell masterplan, led by the former Tyne \u0026amp Wear Development Corporation in the 1990s, the Gateshead side never had an overarching idea in place. John Devlin, Gateshead council’s development director at the time, says the Sage and Baltic were conceived as “anchor tenants” that would then encourage private development for the space in between. In 2004, Taylor Woodrow built an S-shaped flank of cheap-looking apartment blocks that loom immediately behind the Baltic, but their plans to continue across the rest of the site ran out of steam. Other proposals came and went over the years, but nothing stuck.“We could never make it stack up,” says Peter Udall, director of economy, innovation and growth at Gateshead council. “We have long had the ambition for a conference centre on this site, but we could never find the right operator. This is about the third attempt to get something that works.”Following an open OJEU tender process, developer Ask Real Estate and German investment manager Patrizia were selected to work with the council to bring forward plans for the site. As the duo behind Manchester’s uninspiring First Street development, where the cut-price arts venue Home is hemmed in by a tacky hotel and offices, it is not an auspicious choice.The resulting design betrays the piecemeal nature of its evolution, with AHR architects in charge of the boxy hotel and HOK attempting to cram the rest of the facilities on the steeply sloping site, linked by a clumsy series of terraces and steps. In an attempt not to drown out the “iconic” status of its illustrious neighbours, the architects have resorted to a language of banal blocks, jazzed up in places with jaunty angles and faceted rooftops, wrapped in a busy palette of brick, slate, concrete, glass, Corten steel and expanded metal mesh – the latter material listed as “to disguise”, as if in the hope that people might not notice the hulking great pile.In the planning application, the architects describe how brick is used to “draw on the industrial heritage of the site” while the roof of the squat river-facing block has a “sawtooth movement leading to a gradual crescendo” towards the Sage. “The organisation and massing of the large scale components has been carefully curated to complement the immediate context and neighbouring buildings,” they continue, in garbled platitudes. “The expression of the buildings take visitors on a cognitive journey through the site and give clues to the usage and communicates to the visitor at each interface.” By attempting to be both landmark building and background filler, the only journey the architects offer is a one-way ticket to cognitive dissonance.The council is in a bind. While the Sage, the Baltic and the Millennium Bridge were all the result of international design competitions, and led by the council, for this project it has handed over control to the private sector, with predictable results.“The process is very different,” says Udall. “We were the client for the other three projects and were a lot more involved in the detail of the brief. With the arena and conference centre, we feel we can still maintain our influence, but the choice of architect is up to Ask and Patrizia.”Why not insist on an architectural competition, given it is such a prominent site? The complex will be centre stage in views from the Tyne Bridge, and confront anyone looking across the river from Newcastle for generations. “I think we’d have lost the developer if we had insisted on going down the competition route,” says Udall. “It’s such a massive building with so many commercial constraints for the operator. A grain of sand can derail this kind of project.”In the calibre of its design, the proposals sadly call to mind the Trinity Square development nearby. Once home to Owen Luder’s brutalist car park, featured in the 1971 film Get Carter, it was demolished to make way for a comically bad Tesco with student flats on top, shortlisted for the Carbuncle Cup in 2014. As Owen Hatherley wrote at the time: “With this demolition, we’re exchanging architecture as a physical experience for buildings as a mute, grinning, lobotomised accompaniment to consumerism.”It is true that development economics in Gateshead are not comparable to London or Manchester. The town centre is full of vacant retail units, while half of the population has a total household income of under £30,000. The local authority clearly has more urgent priorities. But that’s no excuse to see the waterfront desecrated with such mediocre fare. Enjoying the rare position of being a major landowner, and having a recent history of commissioning brave buildings for the arts, Gateshead council must have the confidence to insist on better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b18c0dcab245779f78b38c10852f95ae732e252/0_63_4817_2891/master/4817.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=70187ac746a874a57ffd38cf13eab33b 1320w","title":"helen garner i may be an old woman but im not done for yet","story":"In this extract from her Griffith Review essay the author wrestles with ageing and the deep need to keep writingWhy did they ask me for an essay about stopping writing? And why did I say yes? Did I tell someone I’d stopped? Have I stopped? I could, if I wanted to, couldn’t I? I’m 77 and I’m pretty tired. And lately I think I’ve copped what the French call “un coup de vieux”: a blow of old. I’ve got arthritis in my left wrist, my right knee gives twinges, and my left foot sometimes aches and stabs all day. Other days, nothing hurts at all. I don’t know what this means.I’ve never written at home, because when I’m hanging round here I keep thinking up tasks, inventing housework, bargaining with my laziness: if I put on a load of washing, for example, 40 minutes later I’ll be allowed to get up from the desk and hang it on the line. So I’ve always rented an office in another suburb, a drab room without wifi where there’s nothing to do except work. It’s spartan, my office some people might call it grim. I like it very much. But I’m not going there today. It’s summer and the family’s gone away. I’m here on my own, without even the dog. My job is to guard the chooks and the vegetable garden. I know it’s neurotic, but I can’t go out. Somebody might break into the house. Junkies from the flats might climb the back fence and steal the bikes. A northerly might get up and tear the nets off the fruit trees. I have to stay home.Right. The essay. I open the laptop at the kitchen table. Nothing happens. I copy out a ferocious quote from a Rachel Cusk essay I’m reading about the artist’s “inviolable selfishness in the face of other people’s needs”. Don’t want to think about that right now. I chew some sugarless gum and spit it into a torn envelope. I go to the broom cupboard and put on my apron: maybe that’ll make me feel businesslike. Maybe I’ll ask them to put an apron on my coffin, if I ever bloody well die. I turn on the radio. Norman Swan is saying that cognitive decline does not necessarily mean Alzheimer’s. How many years have I got left before I hit the age Mum was when she died of Alzheimer’s? Five years. Four and a bit. At that moment the bloke with the mower and the whipper-snipper charges through the back gate. Cheerfully he puts on his headphones and sets up his tremendous roar. Energised by the proximity of someone else’s manual labour, I start randomly rattling away on the keyboard. I may be an old woman, but I’m not done for yet.These days, when in the circumstances I am not getting much done, well-wishers think to comfort one by instancing what one has done already. This is no reassurance. One’s back-catalogue is more of a tribunal. One is arraigned before it and current work (or lack of it) judged. – Alan Bennett, in his 2019 London Review of Books diary.“No, I’m not working on anything.”“You don’t want to talk about it?”“It’s not that. There’s nothing to tell. I’m not writing a book, that’s all.”“Oooh. That must be … uhmm … ”“Actually I’ve often gone for quite long periods without writing a book. Years, even.”“Really? But you published that one, that one about the, sorry, I forget its name, the dam one? The murder trial? That wasn’t very long ago, was it?”“Couple of years ago, yes.”“But haven’t you been at any interesting trials lately? Have you been at the court?”“But you love courts! I heard you say that in an interview! Or was it in a magazine?”“Yes. I do love courts.”“So there isn’t a trial that you’re interested in going to?”Last year my ears started to pack up. If someone in conversation made a gesture that covered her mouth I would slap her hand away. In court I leaned forward, turned my head this way and that, strained in vain. I went to an audiologist. The tests were humiliating: I had to repeat sentences spoken by a voice that kept getting fainter and fainter until all I could say, miserably, over and over, was “No. No. No.” I got hearing aids. They cost an arm and a leg. In court they were no help at all. Too much ambient noise. The cop in front of me scratched his neck and I thought someone was sawing wood. Water gushed into a glass in a gurgling torrent. Counsel’s brilliant submissions were mouths opening and shutting and a harsh nasal stream of vowels. I spent a couple more days in the county and magistrates courts, striving and failing to follow, and emerged from that spectacle of weakness and woe with a broken heart and no story.That’s when I threw in the towel. My life as an amateur journalist was over.Months later I put on my overcoat and found in one of its pockets a small square of paper on which someone had neatly printed, “Helen Garner. Nail clipper x 1. Tweezer x 1,” dated it and signed his name. It was the receipt from security at Broadmeadows magistrates court. My confiscated items must still be out there at Broadie, in a locker or a drawer. I’ll keep that slip of paper forever, to prove to myself that I really did try to keep going.Years ago, in one of those moments of self-hatred that can overcome a woman whose marriage is about to blow up in her face, I asked the man in my life if he thought I was lazy. “No,” he said coolly. “I think you’re a hard-working little money-making machine.” And I was. For 40 years, between books, I wrote freelance journalism. I always had a deadline hanging over me and I loved it: it fed my anxiety, my driven nature. But the years went by, and I grew older. I became a hands-on grandmother. The work I had done began to amount to something. I had a backlist in print. I won a couple of generous awards. Money came to me from people who had died – my parents, and a woman who was a silent benefactor to me and to certain other artists of this country. The tight link between work and money loosened, and fell away. Now, when an editor offers me work, I don’t have to do it. I can open my mouth, and take a breath, and say no. At long last, I’m free.I’m out here, floating.This is the worst possible thing that could happen to a person like me.The thing about writing for publication is that it’s intimately connected with time. You’re always pointed at a future. Someone’s depending on you, waiting for you – probably tapping his foot and looking at his watch, breathing out sharply through his nose, only just holding back a roar of impatience. (My father? Still?) And if that deadline is removed, or so you think, everything will fracture, or go saggy and shapeless. How will I pass the day? Why will I get up in the morning? And what about the things that are swarming all around at me at every moment? Who’s going to see them, record them, save them from oblivion? How will the world continue to exist if I don’t keep writing about it?What I really mean is: How will I stay alive, if I stop writing?Oh, for God’s sake, woman, calm down. Mary Oliver has it covered: “What about all the little stones, sitting alone in the moonlight? … What about the grass?” Again and again she writes about learning to love the world. Is that what I’m trying to get at here?Last year I published Yellow Notebook (Text), a diary that I kept in the 1970s and 1980s. Back then I never thought of it as publishable work. In fact I never thought of it as work at all. I wrote it to clear my head, to keep a record of things I didn’t want to forget, to calm myself before I went to sleep. But mostly I wrote it for the hell of it, because I really love writing. I mean, I love a pen and paper. I love words and sentences, and the way you can knit them together and shift them around and pile them up and spread them out. I love the way the raw material of an ordinary day doesn’t start to reveal its deeper meaning until you’ve got the pen in your hand and you’re halfway down the page.Someone remarked that a lot of the entries “could have been the starts of novels”. I’d had the same thought, while I was editing the old exercise books, and it surprised me. Often I asked myself why I had let this or that incident get past me, why I hadn’t followed it to wherever it might have led, and dug out its potential riches. But the force that draws a writer to one story rather than another does not tap politely at the front door. It shoots an invisible arrow into some murky region of the writer’s unknown needs, and hits a target she didn’t even know was there. That’s when the trouble starts.You have to believe, against the scornful trumpeting of your intellect, in the miraculous ability of form to create itself out of chaos. You have to hold the line through all the wretched days, months, even years that you spend not writing – doing anything but write: “wasting time”, indulging in displacement activities, wandering about pointlessly, biting people’s heads off, seething with anxiety and self-reproach. You have to believe that you’re preparing the ground for something to manifest out of the darkness, to present itself, to be born. Having already gone through this process countless times does not help. You forget, every single time, that it’s coming at you. The anxiety, the self-reproach are always total, unremitting, inescapable. You have to submit to it, allow yourself to suffer it, right to the end.How melodramatic it sounds. Almost laughable. But every writer I know would recognise that description, and shudder.So perhaps, after all, it would be a relief if it never came to me again, that sharp little secret arrow. Do I really miss it, or am I glad to be spared? Will I be spared?While I’m waiting for the answer, quietly growing wearier and achier and deafer, a great treasure is being offered to me daily, a humble glory on a platter, right here in front of me, under my nose.“Are you going to keep on writing about us?” says my 15-year-old grandson in the kitchen, dashing off the crossword that I have cursed and abandoned.“I don’t know.” I look up guiltily. “Would you rather I stopped?”“No,” he says, with his philosophical smile. “I don’t think you should stop.”“Because,” butts in his 12-year-old brother, bouncing his football in a forceful rhythm, “it shows – that we – exist.”• This is an edited extract from Helen Garner’s essay in Griffith Review 68: Getting On ($27.99)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3db66856c8766a325b1fd8c9b94f7a56128d0143/0_858_3101_1860/master/3101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83dcd405f967d35aded7929e7736e2d3","title":"rutger bregman our secret superpower is our ability to cooperate","story":"The historian offers a hopeful view of human nature in his latest book, Humankind. It couldn’t have come at a better timeFor most authors, now is the very worst time to bring out a book. The shops are closed the festival circuit has migrated to Zoom there’s a plague to compete with. But for Rutger Bregman, this might just be the perfect moment to publish Humankind, a sweeping survey of human existence which argues that, despite all our obvious flaws, most people are basically good.A book whose subtitle is “A Hopeful History” should be welcome at a time when people are gagging for cheering news. It fits the mood too, appearing just as neighbours are helping neighbours, people are clapping for carers, and humans the world over are cooperating to save each other’s lives. What’s more, as some are talking of a radical fresh start once we emerge from this crisis, a 1945-style new settlement, Humankind offers a roadmap for how we might organise ourselves very differently.At the very least, the book has all the right ingredients to be a hit. With luminous endorsements from a raft of big names, from Yuval Noah Harari to Stephen Fry an almost indecently readable style and a vast sweep, taking in history, archaeology, psychology, biology, economics, anthropology and much more, it’d be no surprise if it proved to be the Sapiens of 2020.Fame would not be wholly unfamiliar to Bregman, who recently turned 32. He briefly became an online sensation at Davos last year when he turned on his audience, condemning the absurdity of the rich taking 1,500 private jets to hear David Attenborough warn of the climate crisis and, above all, their failure to pay their taxes or even to mention the word. He said he felt as if he were “at a firefighters’ conference and no one’s allowed to speak about water”.He needed to persuade doubters that human beings were not fundamentally selfish, lazy or worse. The trouble was, those doubters included him. Sure, he was drawn to progressive ideas such as UBI or participatory democracy – through which local communities draw up, say, a budget by sitting in a room, thrashing it out and reaching a consensus – but these ideas relied on a very different, benign view of human nature, and “I didn’t really buy this view”. Most of what Bregman had read pointed in the other direction. To resolve that tension he started reading further, and the result, nearly six years later, is Humankind.The book declares that political debate for centuries has turned on a critical argument about human nature. In one corner stands Thomas Hobbes, insisting that, left to their own devices, people will turn on each other in a “war of all against all”: they need the institutions of civilisation to restrain their otherwise base instincts. In the other corner stands Jean-Jacques Rousseau, countering “that man is naturally good, and that it is from these institutions alone that men become wicked”.Bregman charts how Hobbes won the argument. Society and its key institutions –schools, companies, prisons – have been designed based on a set of bleak assumptions about human nature. But, Bregman says, the scientific evidence suggests those assumptions are badly flawed, that as a species we’ve been getting ourselves wrong for far too long.This is where he has most fun, methodically dismantling some of the best-known nuggets of sociological and psychological conventional wisdom. Bregman considers the famous Milgram experiments – which purported to reveal that regular US citizens were willing to administer fatal electric shocks to strangers, so long as they were ordered to do so by a figure of authority – exposing that study’s deep methodological flaws. Did the people of Easter Island really turn on each other in a brutal war that descended into cannibalism? The evidence suggests otherwise.Stone by stone, Bregman breaks up the foundations that underpin much of our understanding of ourselves as callous, uncaring creatures hiding beneath a veneer of civilisation. That understanding has acted as a self-fulfilling prophecy, he says: if people expect the worst of each other, they’ll get it. He can cite the experiments that show even lab rats behave worse when their handlers assume they’ll behave badly. Our true nature is to be kind, caring and cooperative, he argues. We used to be like that – and we can be again.It’s surely not a coincidence that Bregman’s father is a Protestant minister. (His mother is a special needs teacher.) Humankind is the story of a fall from grace. Back when we were hunter-gatherers, we roamed peacefully in the Garden of Eden then we enclosed a square of land, called it our own, invented property and settled down to defend it, wars began and our innocence was lost. Somehow, we have to find our way back to the Garden. Admittedly, that’s my summary of the book, but there’s even a section called The Other Cheek. Bregman may say he’s an atheist, but this is an intensely Christian work, isn’t it?The argument he makes is compelling, not least his suggestion that gloomy assessments of humankind such as William Golding’s or Milgram’s flourished in the postwar era, as the world tried to make sense of the Holocaust. One section of the book is titled “After Auschwitz”. Which brings us to the biggest roadblock in the way of his argument. How to square the notion that humans are fundamentally good with a long and continuing history of humanmade horror, exemplified by the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews, including more than a million children? Bregman does an admirable job debunking those post-Holocaust experiments and theories, but the Holocaust itself still stands there, implacable and unmoving.He has thought about it hard, noting that people are only really capable of doing dreadful things once they are physically distant from each other (and the book has fascinating stats on soldiers’ recurrent refusal to shoot at the enemy, a pattern going back centuries). But what about the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing squads that murdered an estimated 1.3 million Jews up close? Those men had established “psychological distance” from their victims, Bregman says, after exposure to years of Nazi propaganda. That might account for the German gunmen, but what about their collaborators in Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Ukraine, people who’d had far less such exposure?Bregman cites evidence that the motivation of perpetrators was often rooted in qualities we’d ordinarily admire: loyalty to their fellow soldiers, for example. He notes how the friendliness that sets humans apart – he calls our species “Homo Puppy” – has a dark side, because empathy with “us” can turn to murderous hostility to “not us”. “Our secret superpower” is our friendliness and ability to cooperate, he says, and yet “we’re also the cruellest of species”. But surely, that latter statement fatally undermines his thesis?“I would emphasise that I’m not actually saying that people are good. The title of the book in Dutch is De Meeste Mensen Deugen, which is ‘Most People Are Deugen’, with deugen a word that you cannot translate. It’s sort of like ‘pretty decent deep down’ or ‘good after all’.” Later he refers to human destructiveness in these terms: “We’re not born to do this, but we’re capable of it.”We talk about his age, and whether it takes the confidence of youth to write a book so bold and broad in its assertions, and to be willing to take on his elders: it includes repeated swipes at giants in the genre such as Harari, Malcolm Gladwell and Steven Pinker. (Bregman admits: “I was jealous of Sapiens.”) He says he has been lucky to be free of the specialisation demanded by academia, working instead for the much-admired Dutch journal De Correspondent, which gave him the freedom to pursue whatever interested him. It also meant he was not required to write news, which he thinks is as harmful to our minds as sugar is to our bodies, constantly focusing on the exceptional, which means the negative. But yes, he concedes, maybe the fact that he has few ties – no children yet – played a part. Besides, “I think that often the best work that people do is when they’re young, right?”So does his confidence extend to this current moment? Is a reshaping of society towards cooperation and equality, at work, at school, in prison and in politics on its way? He says he doesn’t know, though he was struck by a recent and much-discussed Financial Times editorial calling for redistribution, UBI and wealth taxes. He’s been heartened by the “explosion of cooperation and altruism and people organising stuff from the bottom up” in response to the pandemic. But he says the crucial thing is that the left is ready when the immediate crisis passes, that its ideas are the ones “lying around” waiting to be picked up. Among those close to the top of the pile will, surely, be his.• Humankind by Rutger Bregman is published by Bloomsbury (RRP £20). To order a copy go to bookshop.

As ambassadors and high commissioners representing the EU and its 27 countries in the UK, we are nonetheless very keen to mark the date with all the citizens of this great country and with the millions of EU nationals who live and work in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.We celebrate Europe on 9 May because on this same day in 1950, exactly 70 years ago, in the aftermath of the devastating second world war, Robert Schuman, the Luxembourg-born foreign minister of France, laid the foundations of our collective endeavour. He said then: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan. It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.”Since then, Schuman’s dream has come gradually to fruition, enabling many countries and millions of Europeans to enjoy freedom, democracy, fundamental rights and high standards of living, in what historians will register as the longest period of peace in our part of the world for many centuries.After progressively enlarging its scope, both politically and geographically, the EU became the biggest single market and the most important provider of development and humanitarian aid in the world, a true global actor committed to effective multilateralism. With almost half a billion citizens, it brings together peoples and nations from all over Europe who are proud of their history and culture but know they will be stronger together. It is telling that this year, we also mark the 25th anniversary of the accession to the union of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and the 40th anniversary of the historic Solidarity movement in Poland.All this and much more is what we are proudly celebrating today. We do so while looking forward, with confidence, to the future of our union, focused on finding a common way out of the health emergency, ensuring an inclusive economic recovery and building the foundations for sustainable development in Europe and around the world.The United Kingdom made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the European Union. It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country.The current unprecedented health emergency has brought us closer together – within each of our countries and among the 27, as well as between all of us in the EU and our British friends. We all know that Covid-19 spares no one – no family, no country. We all know that only together will we be able to overcome it.In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic.An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely. British flights did the same for EU citizens. These examples illustrate how the most challenging situations bring to the fore the best in each of us, as the Queen so eloquently highlighted in her broadcast to the nation on 5 April.A democratic decision, which we regret but fully respect, was made by the United Kingdom to leave the EU. We are now implementing the transitional provisions of the withdrawal agreement while negotiating the terms of our future relations. For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought.Indeed, in today’s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states – and peoples – is essential. A good example is what the UK and Italy are doing together on the climate crisis, in jointly ensuring that the Cop26 conference delivers a high level of global ambition to overcome this major challenge for mankind. Another is the ongoing global pledge to finance treatment and vaccination against Covid-19, of which the EU and the UK are major sponsors.We believe that cooperation and solidarity among countries, with full respect for sovereignty and ersity, are key factors in overcoming today’s challenges, starting with the present health emergency. We trust that these principles will also inspire the future relationship between the UK and the EU – and that is the friendly message that, as a united group of 28 ambassadors and high commissioners, we would like to convey to the British people on this Europe Day.This article was jointly authored by: João Vale de Almeida, ambassador of the European Union to the United Kingdom Michael Zimmermann, ambassador of Austria Ellen De Geest, chargé d’affaires of Belgium Marin Raykov, ambassador of Bulgaria Igor Pokaz, ambassador of Croatia Andreas S Kakouris, high commissioner of Cyprus Libor Sečka, ambassador of the Czech Republic Lars Thuesen, ambassador of Denmark Tiina Intelmann, ambassador of Estonia Markku Keinänen, ambassador of Finland Catherine Colonna, ambassador of France Julia Gross, chargé d’affaires of Germany Dimitris Caramitsos-Tziras, ambassador of Greece Ferenc Kumin, ambassador of Hungary Adrian O’Neill, ambassador of Ireland Raffaele Trombetta, ambassador of Italy Katarina Plātere, chargé d’affaires of Latvia Renatas Norkus, ambassador of Lithuania Jean Olinger, ambassador of Luxembourg Joseph Cole, high commissioner of Malta Simon Smits, ambassador of the Netherlands Arkady Rzegocki, ambassador of Poland Manuel Lobo Antunes, ambassador of Portugal Sorin-Dan Mihalache, ambassador of Romania Lubomír Rehák, ambassador of Slovakia Tadej Rupel, ambassador of Slovenia Carlos Bastarreche, ambassador of Spain Torbjörn Sohlström, ambassador of Sweden"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cea880376c5e20c9297527798f8c18b19b0faa45/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef0e7d2bed7c003083fb8f917df5cbf3","title":"lockdown see natural world anew not waste","story":"The pandemic is giving us a lesson in life, hope and death. It’s one we should never forgetBack in the days when we all still hurried oblivious through crowded city streets, the names chalked on the pavement must have been easily missed. But now a long-running campaign by rebel botanists across Europe to highlight overlooked nature in the city, scribbling names and plant details alongside a pretty weed growing through a wall or a tree spreading overhead, has unexpectedly found its niche.Going for a walk is the only real freedom many have had for weeks, and with no particular place to go but out, there is finally time to notice nature creeping through the cracks: the birdsong no longer drowned out by traffic the daffodils in front gardens giving way to frothy peonies a fat supermoon hanging heavy on the night horizon.Our relationship with the natural world is changing as this crisis strips away the layers between humans and the surroundings we used to be too busy to take in. The outdoors, once something glimpsed from a train window, has become somewhere to relieve the anxiety and sometimes let out the grief.Out here in the countryside, lockdown has been perhaps a gentler experience than in the cities. But still the tangible signs of spring unfurling into lush, green summer have been one of the few things giving shape to these nebulous, anxious weeks. When everything else feels jangling and wrong, the sight of meadows turning yellow with buttercups, or the sweet-sour tang of elderflowers blooming in the hedgerows, confirms that at least something is unfolding roughly as it should.I have stopped measuring time by useless empty calendars and started measuring it in the garden, where life goes on even when human clocks have stopped. The seeds planted in a fit of jittery displacement activity when lockdown started were green shoots by the time it was renewed, and are tall enough to go out in the vegetable patch now that the rules are on the verge of being renewed again. I suspect we’ll have eaten the tomatoes and courgettes long before it ends. Growing things makes me wonder who will bring a gardener’s mentality to this crisis, planting the seeds of ideas that will bear fruit in years to come.One of the few things to emerge with any clarity from muddled government messages about the next phase is that the outdoors will become much more important to us, because that’s where the first signs of normal life will return. Talk of being allowed to sunbathe in parks, have picnics or go rambling may sound Enid Blyton-esque but outside may be the best place for the anxious to be, and not just in a pandemic. Research repeatedly shows that being close to the wild makes people feel healthier and happier.This pandemic must surely lead to far greater scrutiny of the relationship between human health and the natural world, with scientists warning that deforestation and habitat destruction have driven wild animals into closer proximity with humans and helped novel viruses leap the species barrier. Such cavalier, short-sighted exploitation of our environment cannot carry on.But closer to home, it should also stop us taking small British family farmers for granted, or imposing brutal forms of Brexit that leave nothing but the most industrialised agribusinesses standing. Farmers and food producers aren’t classed as key workers for nothing when the supermarkets ran out of delivery slots for vulnerable people, in rural communities it was farm shops and vegetable-box schemes, flour mills and backyard chicken keepers who filled the gap.Developers eyeing up once unloved parks and urban green spaces, meanwhile, can forget it. When this is over people will want more, not less, of the lungs that help cities breathe: more tree planting in urban streets and more room for allotments. City living isn’t dead – no matter how many Londoners have wistfully Googled “moving to the country” over the last few weeks – but must make room for people to live a little closer to nature than they currently do.Right across the country, we should insist that new housebuilding schemes leave room for families to have proper gardens and grow food communally schools, too, need wild places for children to play, not just asphalt and sports fields. It’s not about preparing for another pandemic so much as learning the lessons this one is teaching us about emotionally resilient lives. Research published this week by the University of Exeter, showing people who can get into a garden are healthier and happier than those who can’t, was conducted before anyone had heard of Covid-19 but it makes even more sense now.Greens must still tread sensitively in response to this changing mood. Many people clearly take comfort from the idea that, with planes grounded and cars gathering dust, at least the planet can get a break from us. But if climate change campaigners are seen to be rejoicing too much in the accidental outcomes of a sad and terrifying time, they’ll lose sympathy. With thousands of airline workers losing their jobs, it will be a while before most people feel comfortable celebrating the decline of polluting industries.What environmentalists can do, even at the peak of a crisis forcing us all to live our lives in miniature, however, is to think local. Willingness to see the global picture often begins in inidual backyards. Campaigns to clear the oceans of plastic start with picking up rubbish on the beach. Encouraging wildflowers to grow on verges, as Rotherham council has been doing along an eight-mile stretch of road for years now, gets people thinking not only about the overuse of pesticides but about how to live with nature instead of constantly trying to overcome it.And taking up gardening can bring some comfort in times of loss, helping us to accept the passage of time and begin to come to terms with the cycle of life, death and hope.A garden is a reminder that there will always be a next summer, and hopefully a better one than this but it’s also a way of leaving something behind, for those who may not have another summer in them. When the journalist Deborah Orr was dying she ordered hundreds of tulip bulbs, tweeting that she would have made a piece of spring even if she wasn’t around to see it. Life as we used to know it will not return for everyone. But we have time to plant something green and new in its place."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ea08e5218eee170e984e22da670a1debb6f96e2/0_2_1654_994/master/1654.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a822c5d130eff0d8caad815dd56aea96","title":"phones away please the rise and rise of the online pub quiz","story":"Your local boozer might be shut but the pub quiz lives on, with everyone from Helen Mirren to Stephen Fry asking the questionsIn an unidentified magnolia room, Lenny Henry is yelling: “Let me hear you say: ‘YEAH.’” Next to his face, a live chat feed blurts out heart emojis and comments such as: “Hello, Sir Lenny!”. Or: “I’ve had the biggest crush on Lenny Henry since his Chef days.” Or: “Hi, my team name is Wuhan Clan.”The Dudley comic is hosting the National Theatre’s online pub quiz, a pre-recorded broadcast, streamed via YouTube and Facebook. He is joined by Lesley Manville, Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen to pose 15 minutes’ worth of intensely difficult general knowledge questions to the public. And, bizarrely, to announce that: “I will pull interesting faces while you write the answer down,” before shooting his eyebrows to the sky and gaping his jaw as if he’s running an advertising campaign for his own tonsils. Still, this is lockdown living everything’s a bit odd.Since our sofas became the buzziest nightspot in town, pub quizzes have captured our imaginations as ways to bond across the internet with friends and family. And cultural figures have not failed to notice their popularity, with podcasts, theatres and celebrities setting up their own digital versions. Stephen Fry, Jo Brand and the brains behind QI are now hosting a regular version for Riverside Studios. You can fund an anti-hunger charity by doing a picture round with the ex-frontman of the Stranglers, have the comedian Ed Gamble ask you trivia that’s been compiled by a jewellery brand, or take part in a massive, fancy-dress recreation of Only Connect organised by Stevie Martin and Tessa Coates of the Nobody Panic podcast.“Quizzes are just a really great way to have a shared experience, to connect with other people,” says Coates of the event that she put on due to popular demand by listeners. “Our quiz was honestly the most joyful hour I’ve spent since lockdown started.”The comically budget version of Victoria Coren Mitchell’s show that they put on – renamed “Nobody Connect” for copyright reasons – saw them completely overwhelmed by people flocking to answer questions via Zoom. They might have had an upturned tent serving as the show’s customary blue background and one of the hosts confusingly dressed as Richard Osman (“Stevie’s never seen Only Connect”), but they wound up having to turn people away. “We were like: ‘Maybe six people will come,’” laughs Coates. “It ended up being one in, one out: for an online quiz!”Last week, The Covid Arms attempted to break the Guinness world record for most visitors to a virtual pub. Chosen format? A quiz that saw the likes of Russell Howard, Nish Kumar and The Chase’s Jenny Ryan running rounds. On the National Theatre’s quiz stream, the people merrily saying hello in the live chat hail from as far afield as Australia, India, Germany and Croatia. Quizzers have turned out in their droves to watch Helen Mirren sitting in her bedroom, reading out questions about history. It is also hard not to note that she has a slightly wonky bedside lamp. Or that Lesley Manville has artfully tilted her camera up so you can’t see her bedspread.“Part of the beauty of these quizzes is that there’s just something so levelling about them,” offers Coates. “We’re all at home and we’re all desperate for human contact. It’s a great chance to feel like we’re all in the same boat, even if your host is someone like Dame Helen Mirren.”Given that your quizmaster is in a different location, these events also offer the chance to be a total cheat, if you want to. “But what would be the point?” asks Paul Roberts, the ex-Stranglers frontman, whose Indy-House Pub Quiz sees around 100 teams congregate via Zoom to answer trivia questions interspersed with the odd musical interlude where people dance around their living rooms to songs such as Johnny Cash’s Ring of Fire. “If you’re sitting at home making up things to win a prize, would you feel good the next day? These events are about the coming together they’ve been driven by popular demand. It’s people working at their best.”As the National Theatre quiz comes to an end, participants really seem to be having fun with the format. Commenters are mock-quibbling over how many points they’re entitled to. Even Lenny Henry is enjoying joking around with the format. It’s not often that pub quiz hosts reveal their own answers in a shrill tone of shock that suggests they’ve never seen them before. Or exclaim: “HOW COULD THAT BE?” in response to their facts. But then pub quizzes are rarely delivered by knights of the realm across the internet to an entirely house-bound audience. Our times aren’t normal, so neither, increasingly, are our pub quizzes.

She has been sharing a daily image with them via Blipfoto for the last six and a half years, but photographing nature has provided a particularly welcome escape in recent weeksCutting short our holiday to Cuba as Covid-19 took off, it was an eerie feeling transferring through an emptying Paris Charles de Gaulle airport in the middle of the day with the shutters down on duty free. I wasn’t sure what to expect when we got home but, while life felt uncertain, I knew my wildlife - my haven - would still be there. The countryside around Burley-in-Wharfedale, my home, has become my daily sanctuary, now more than ever.One stick, five gates. Living in a village, we have the luxury of the countryside on our doorstep, but with it, comes the challenge of multiple gates, now being handled by multiple people. A carefully chosen single-outing stick is doing the trick nicely for every type of opening.Walking much closer to home and for less time, I’ve been worried that I wouldn’t be able to find my moment with nature anymore, but something always turns up. Here a tawny mining bee fell out of a tree in front of my lens 300 metres from home.I’m finding moments arriving as if on cue, just when I need them the most. The last time I saw a brimstone butterfly was 2017, so imagine my delight at spotting this one glaring at me in the sunshine in front of a deep gorse dell.Normally I just enjoy happening on butterflies as the season warms up, but this year I’ve taken utmost pleasure from looking out for which one is due to emerge next - from the hibernating overwintering adults to the first to emerge fresh from their pupae. The green hairstreak is a local favourite of mine - surprisingly easy to miss!Even this elusive chiffchaff seemed willing to be on film. Perhaps having recently arrived and being hungry, this one was less cautious about being captured as it picked off tiny bugs from budding trees.I call this one “crouching toad, hidden dog”. Our dog can’t walk as far as she used to, but I managed to time one of my few walks up onto the moors since lockdown perfectly for the day the toads got active. Perhaps the out-take should have been my record as one clambered onto my glasses when I took a moment to read the settings on my camera.It seemed trivial to be photographing a bee on the day after it was announced that Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus, but I’ve concluded that everyone has to hang on to their sanity in their own way.In Yorkshire we can’t have been luckier with the weather recently. We’ve had the luxury of days on end of blue skies and the birds have been making the most of it too.It’s been the colours and the shapes of nature as well as the expressions of wildlife that have given me a daily smile in these uncertain times. In particular, I’m finding the spring colours of lemons and limes giving me a real boost. This willow warbler taken through gorse is my recent favourite. Wildlife has always been and will continue to be my sanctuary.Over time, I’ve found a few local nooks and crannies to keep an eye on at different times of the year. This is one of them in a beautiful woodland back garden I walk past. This kestrel seemed to be owning the space here, but in the last few days the jackdaws have moved in and the kestrel has reluctantly moved two metres upstairs into another box. They live with physical distancing as the norm. It works. I’ll hold onto that thought."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc8e64a418bc6730796b4c97e63ab1730f5dd9d8/0_14_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deb6e29c0ff2dff91bc0989e15d50a6f","title":"climate change global heating extreme heat humidity","story":"Scientists identify thousands of extreme events, suggesting stark warnings about global heating are already coming to passIntolerable bouts of extreme humidity and heat which could threaten human survival are on the rise across the world, suggesting that worst-case scenario warnings about the consequences of global heating are already occurring, a new study has revealed.Scientists have identified thousands of previously undetected outbreaks of the deadly weather combination in parts of Asia, Africa, Australia, South America and North America, including several hotspots along the US Gulf coast.Humidity is more dangerous than dry heat alone because it impairs sweating – the body’s life-saving natural cooling system.The number of potentially fatal humidity and heat events doubled between 1979 and 2017, and are increasing in both frequency and intensity, according to the study published in Science Advances.In the US, the south-eastern coastal corner from eastern Texas to the Florida Panhandle experienced such extreme conditions dozens of times, with New Orleans and Biloxi, Mississippi the hardest hit.The most extreme incidents occurred along the Persian Gulf, where the heat and humidity combination surpassed the theoretical human survivability limit on 14 occasions. Doha, the capital of Qatar, where the World Cup will be held in 2022, was among the places to suffer – albeit briefly – these potentially fatal weather events.The ominous findings come as something of a surprise to scientists, as previous studies had projected such extreme weather events would occur later in the century, mostly in parts of the tropics and subtropics where humidity is already a problem.“Previous studies projected that this would happen several decades from now, but this shows it’s happening right now,” said lead author Colin Raymond from Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. “The times these events last will increase, and the areas they affect will grow in direct correlation with global warming.”Earlier studies relied on average heat and humidity recorded over several hours in large areas, whereas the Columbia team analysed hourly data from 7,877 inidual weather stations, allowing them to pinpoint short, localized incidents.In dry conditions, the body sweats out excess heat through the skin, where it then evaporates away. Humidity impedes evaporation, and can even halt it completely in extreme conditions. If the body’s core overheats, organs can quickly begin to fail and lead to death within hours.Meteorologists measure the heathumidity effect on the so-called “wet bulb” Centigrade scale, known as the “heat index”, or “real-feel” Fahrenheit readings in the US.Even the strongest, well-adapted people cannot carry out ordinary outdoor activities like walking or digging once the wet bulb hits 32C, though most would struggle well before that. In theory, humans cannot survive above 35C on the wet bulb scale – the peak suffered in small areas of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates, according to the study.Slightly less extreme but more frequent outbreaks were detected across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, north-western Australia, and coastal regions along the Red Sea and Mexico’s Gulf of California.“We may be closer to a real tipping point than we think,” said co-author Radley Horton.Air conditioning should help mitigate the impact for some people in rich countries such as the US and Qatar, but longer enforced periods indoors could have devastating economic consequences, according to Horton. Nor is air conditioning an option for most people in the poorer high-risk countries where subsistence farming remains common.Kristina Dahl, a climatologist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in the US, said the new paper shows “how close communities around the world are to the limits”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e126e7b7179618363104e61dfa808dcbfef98000/0_0_5351_3212/master/5351.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3a8db1aeab33ff582da7202d7bf5bcf","title":"sea levels could rise more than a metre by 2100 experts say","story":"Oceans rising faster than previously thought, according to survey of 100 specialistsSea-level rise is faster than previously believed and could exceed 1 metre by the end of the century unless global emissions are reduced, according to a survey of more than 100 specialists.Based on new knowledge of climate sensitivity and polar ice melt, the experts say coastal cities should prepare for an impact that will hit sooner than predicted by the United Nations and could reach as high as 5 metres by 2300.“A global sea-level rise by several metres would be detrimental for many coastal cities such as Miami, New York, Alexandria, Venice, Bangkok, just to name a few well-known examples. Some may have to be abandoned altogether as they cannot be defended,” said co-author Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.In the worst-case scenario – with rising emissions and global heating of 4.5C above pre-industrial levels – the study estimates the surface of the world’s oceans in 2100 will be between 0.6 and 1.3 metres higher than today, which would potentially engulf areas  home to hundreds of millions of people.By contrast, if humanity succeeds in cutting carbon dioxide and holding the increase in temperature to 2C, the rise would be a more manageable 0.5 metre.The figures for both pathways are more pessimistic than those outlined by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), which predicts the worst possibility is a 1.1-metre rise by 2100.The gap reflects advances in climate science and differences in approach. The IPCC works largely through consensus among scientific working groups, which tends to produce relatively conservative estimates.By contrast, the new survey – published in the journal Climate and Atmospheric Science – aggregates the views of 106 specialists, who were chosen because they have published at least six peer-reviewed papers on the subject in major academic journals. As a result, the predictions are more representative of a range of views in the field.The higher estimates highlight growing concern about the world’s two biggest ice sheets, in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellite data and on-the-ground measurements show these regions are melting faster than most computer models predicted. Many of the scientists said there was now greater understanding of the risks posed by marine ice-cliff instability, which can lead to the collapse of ice shelves.The study was led by scientists at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore with support from seven research institutions across the world, including Durham University in the UK, Tufts University in the US and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.The lead author, Prof Benjamin Horton of the university’s Asian School of the Environment, said the research aimed to condense the growing mass of academic studies about sea-level projections into a simple overview. “It is useful to survey leading experts on the expected sea-level rise, which provides a broader picture of future scenarios and informs policymakers so they can prepare necessary measures,” he said.The authors said the results showed how much warming – and sea-level rise – could be avoided if governments fulfilled their 2015 Paris climate agreement promises to cut emissions of the gases that are heating the planet. Most countries are far off reaching their goals.“Like in the Covid pandemic, timing is critical to prevent devastation. If you wait until you already have a serious problem, then it is too late. Unlike with corona, sea-level rise cannot be stopped for many centuries or even millennia once ice sheets have been destabilised past their tipping points,” Rahmstorf said.But, without deeper structural changes, the reduction is likely to be temporary and will make little difference to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met Office predicted on Thursday carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa measuring station would rise 2.5 parts per million this year.“Although emissions are reducing this year, this does not mean the build-up of CO2 in the atmosphere will reverse – it will just be slightly slower” the Met Office’s chief CO2 forecaster, Richard Betts, said in a blogpost.“An analogy is filling a bath from a tap – it’s like we are turning down the tap, but because we are not turning off the tap completely, the water level is still rising.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c65227ccbc5aa57db17b7966d92278db6dd526a9/0_0_2995_1997/master/2995.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=668fee1726413814cc7fe87b22ddd366","title":"how to support the best british nail brands","story":"We can lend a shaky hand to the struggling salon sector as we file and paint during lockdownIt may be one minuscule piece of good fortune in this crisis, but we can also lend a shaky hand to the struggling salon sector as we file and paint.When it comes to beautiful, gift-worthy packaging, Nailberry, a British independent used in high-end nail bars, can, in my view, compete with YSL and Chanel – and I don’t say this lightly.

Over the past 60 odd years they’ve been drenched in confusing controversy – to eat or not to eat, what kind should we eat, and according to who?Animal fats have the worst reputation of all. I’m not here to argue the health facts – but please take the time to look at the research regarding what we replaced many old fashioned animal fats with, namely hydrogenated vegetable oils. Nutritionists suggest neither should play a major role in your diet – but many people who happily reach for margarine still flinch at lard. When I talk about and write recipes, I often call for suet, rendered tallow, schmaltz, lard, ghee, butter, duck or goose fat, cold pressed olive, avocado or macadamia oil. Why? As anyone who has ever had duck fat roasted potatoes, or chips cooked in tallow can attest – it tastes better and it gives better results.Animal fats have a high smoking point, so they’re good for cooking at high temperatures. If you’re someone who still chooses to eat meat, using animal fats in this way is something you should do sparingly – but when you do, it will be delicious.I learned how to make lard when I was five, this has been a part of my culinary heritage. I learned it from my mother who learned it from her mother, and backwards it goes.This whole thing – nose to tail, root to tip. It’s not new, it was the result of necessity. Delicious traditional cooking is universal, and comes in part from ingenuity in waste management. If you’re already comfortable cooking with animal fat, make your own rather than buying it. It is very easy to do and will save you a lot of money.Different parts of the animal have different components of fats and they taste different too. For example, on a pig you would ask for leaf lard, which is fat from around the kidney. It does not have a ‘porky’ taste, and is the secret ingredient in many pie crusts – even sweet ones. So, where do you get it? Butchers are a good place to start. You can also chat with them, ask them where their animals come from, about their welfare and how they were raised. Make it a point to go to butchers that bring in whole animals and break them down themselves.If we as consumers don’t demand, and aren’t ready to pay a little extra for better quality food, we are unlikely to get it. Go one step further and ask about animals reared on farms that have an emphasis on regenerative agriculture methods. Buying fat from a pastured source will not break the bank, because a little goes a very long way.For schmaltz, you want to use the skin and fat of the bird. Once again ask your butcher, or reserve the skin in the freezer when you’re cooking other poultry dishes, until you have enough to render down.I’ve rendered my fair share of chicken schmaltz, tallow and lard over the years. While I’ll use pork fat as an example, essentially the method can be applied to all manner of animal fats. You can substitute the direction with any you want.The easiest and fastest way to do this is on the stove top, preferably with a deep flat bottomed saucepan that has an even heat distribution, but a wok will also suffice.The two main ways suggested for rendering are wet (with water) or straight (without water). I do it straight as it involves one step less to process at the end, but this requires you to stay with your pan to prevent overcooking and essentially burning. If you prefer to turn on a slow cooker and leave it unattended, you are most welcome to – but be warned this method can take much longer, a few hours or so.Let’s get to it. I promise you that after you’ve done this once, it is impossible not to want to do it again.Take 1kg of pork leaf lard (from around the kidneys), but really do whatever quantity your heart desires. The thing to do here is freeze it first. By freezing the fat you will make it much more easily manageable to cut into, a whole lot less messy too.From there, cut it into little cubes – no need to get your ruler out. Roughly the size of a 50c piece is adequate.Pop all the lard into the pan and place onto the lowest heat element on your stove top. Stir the bottom very minimally, every 10 minutes or so. And in that time, prepare sterilised glass jars or a glass container that has an airtight lid.In order to get the lard from the saucepan to the jars I use a large glass Pyrex measuring cup, on top of which I put a metal mesh strainer, but you can easily substitute this for a stainless steel bowl with a metal mesh strainer on top.As you cook, delicious crispy bits will rise to the top. These are a bit like crackling, and you can add them to all sorts of delectable dishes. Prepare a kitchen towel or paper towel on a flat plate, that you can put the ‘crackling’ on to – use a mesh skimmer spoon if you have one to extract it.This whole process takes about 20-30 minutes depending on your heat element. Keep watching it to avoid burning and overcooking. A good way to know when it is done is all the crackling will rise to the surface and look lightly fried. Turn the gas off and spoon these out onto your waiting plate.Leave the lard to cool in the pan a little before you pour it over the strainer. Don’t skip the straining step, as this will prevent your lard from going rancid faster.Jar your lard and lid it when it is cold. Use it as you would oil or butter, to cook anything and everything from stir frying, roasting, baking, shallow frying or braising. If you are making this at home, you aren’t likely to be rendering 3kg or more at a time, so the chance the fat will go rancid before you are able to use it all up is minimal. That’s unlike vegetable or nut oils, which surprisingly become rancid very easily if you keep them out of the fridge.While it is certainly a “sometimes food”, for me at least it stirs the kind of satiety that eating commercial packaged, processed foods can never equal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125a0158798b35b351d99e1ce22246361d4bb174/0_156_5242_3146/master/5242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8544667ab83556737f7ba08f1b694a8","title":"covid 19 impact on football 10 years get back where we were managers players scout","story":"Figures from across the men’s professional game including managers, players and a scout, discuss how football will alterWhen life has finally returned to normal, I think football will change for the better. We should see the reversal of a power balance that has swung the wrong way for too long, switching it back in favour of the clubs. I would certainly expect that to happen in the isions below the Premier League, where the financial implications of Covid-19 are hitting particularly hard. Players and agents will have to lower their expectations, and we will see fewer instances of football clubs being held to ransom over deals and contracts.Anyone going in saying, ‘This guy wants this money, and I want this amount for doing the deal’, might have to face a new reality. Do you want the club to go out of existence, and then there’s no club to play at? If agents ask too much then clubs will say: ‘No problem, we’ll do something else.’Recruitment will change and that may well see more youth players becoming involved. At Ipswich we have a really talented group from under-15s and under-16s upwards. I know that if we can’t go out and spend a certain amount, we can bring these guys in and develop them.The supporters can relate to that. Mass gatherings look like the very last port of call but I think a positive knock-on effect will ultimately be that fans and players are brought closer together, and the atmosphere in most stadiums could improve.Being cynical, I think you have to say a lot of clubs will see this as a decent opportunity to reboot. It is hard to argue against that happening in a lot of cases, if you take out the emotion and passion of it. I saw Barnet were losing £100,000 a month how can that be allowed or sustainable? At QPR we spend 65p for every pound we bring in but others in our league are spending £1.75 or £2.05.People compare this to 2008 but the difference feels like the scale by which club owners have seen their own businesses decimated. Given owners are going to be hit in the long term, I really think it could be another 10 years before we get back to a financial level similar to now.I think there will be a correction and prudent approach generally but I’m not convinced that at the top level clubs won’t continue to pay top dollar for top players. I still think we will see big fees the best still want the best and will pay big money to get them. If you look at the last five to 10 years, there has been an incredible rise in the scale of Premier League wages, which affects clubs like ours who then drop down a level. The market has run away with itself I’ve actually been really surprised at Championship wage levels.I believe the early days of our return may see change, whether that is the attendance in the stadium or how we travel to matches. But as not many people like change even when it’s for the better, if there is any long term it will, for sure, happen slowly. I think we may well eventually return to how things were.Tosin Adarabioyo, Manchester City (on loan at Blackburn)One of my managers used to tell me, ‘Scout creatively’, and that will be a buzz phrase for the foreseeable future. With travel so restricted, and with few games taking place, video analysis is going to be fundamental. It will not come as a shock to clubs in the top two isions, because most of them are already very advanced on that side of things, but it will bring difficulties.While the various scouting platforms offer an invaluable depth of information, they only provide so much of what a scout needs. The statistics are vital but to see an inidual’s real character, and how they handle themselves in certain situations, you have to watch them in the flesh.As a result, and with the lack of money going round, I think clubs will be particularly cautious when considering big signings in the short or medium term. It is hard to make conclusive judgments from a distance and there will be a certain nervousness about making costly mistakes.That is where imagination comes in, and I think the present situation may breed a more creative kind of scouting. Clubs will put more energy into looking for bargains lower down the isions, or in smaller foreign leagues. You’re always trying to find a hidden gem but the rewards for reaching beyond the obvious may be even greater now.The likes of Sheffield United and Burnley, who do not employ vast numbers of scouts but have sophisticated operations and always recruit well, look well equipped to handle what is coming. The best setups see scouts and technology working together in a well-organised structure with a transparent exchange of ideas.Absolutely it will change, at least for the next few years. Top players and their agents will still command big money and it won’t affect super-wealthy owners as much but there will be changes until the economy recovers. For players coming through the ranks, even at Premier League level, there are likely to be lower salaries and more incentivised contracts.Financial constraints will test the resolve and mindsets of squad players. Players in their late 20s, early 30s may not be able to command £2,500 a week at a League One club when owners start looking to younger players, with more potential resale value, on £500 a week. They are at risk of being thrust out of the game and agents will have to ensure they get second careers and support them with their mental health.If there are more incentivised contracts and less money guaranteed then clubs will have to be more open in terms of their budgets and commercial income. There’s a danger some clubs might use the crisis to low-ball players and that’s risky because they may lose out to other clubs willing to pay. But this could be a reset for football with young, hungry talent coming through. Owners still want to win, ultimately, and after two or three years of taking stock they will dig deep again.When it comes to recruitment you have to work with a very wide range of scenarios. You have to do a lot of planning. It will certainly force clubs to become creative about how they can drive revenues from matchdays without fans in the stadium. At FC Midtjylland we have introduced a drive-in football concept where people will be watching the games on big screens from their cars outside the stadium. That’s the kind of idea that can help reduce the damage from losing your normal matchday income.Rasmus Ankersen, Brentford director of football and FC Midtjylland chairmanThe primary change we’ll see is a reduction in transfer fees. We’ve hit a time in which footballers costing £100m-plus isn’t considered shocking I think that will change.

As the targeted interventions manager at the Palace for Life Foundation – Crystal Palace’s charity – Henry uses football to help disadvantaged young people in south London and organises a team of mentors who try to keep them on the straight and narrow.“Most of them have been arrested or been in gangs and we try to get them into positive outcomes,” he says. “We’re based in schools and a custody suite for our Divert programme, which aims to get them back into employment and training. Around this time of year we usually help with the transition from year six to year seven but because of the lockdown that couldn’t happen.”With half of Palace for Life’s staff furloughed and only children of key workers attending school, Henry and his mentors quickly realised they needed to find a new way of staying connected.“For the first couple of weeks we were just checking in with our young people and most of them said they were spending most of the time on their Xbox or PlayStation,” he says. “That was when we thought: ‘I wonder if that can help us continue our work?’”The foundation has since provided consoles to a number of local families thanks to a partnership with the gaming retailer Go2Games, enabling the mentors to communicate with their young people on a daily basis via the consoles’ chat facility.“They are learning very quickly if they don’t know already how to play Fifa or Fortnite,” says Mike Summers, the Palace for Life Foundation’s chief executive. “In a normal situation we are encouraging young people to get out and be active but most of the activities aren’t possible. It’s early days but we have had some very promising signs about how young people are responding.”Almost six weeks after lockdown measures were implemented, however, Henry admits some have taken matters into their own hands. He says one child, who had recently moved to a school in a different borough because he was getting into trouble, ran away from home for a few days.“We’re dealing with a lot more cases of kids feeling anxiety,” he says. “It’s our job to offer some support in terms of their mental health. But there are a few who are seeing this as an opportunity because they have previously been involved in crime. They think that no one is watching what they are doing and there is no one to stop them going wherever they want in half the time it usually takes.“We have reminded them about the consequences of their actions: just because you got away with it once that doesn’t mean you will next time. We’ve had a few cases of people saying they are going out to meet their friends but this gives us another chance to emphasise the government’s message that they are putting their own families at risk.“We’re trying to encourage them to use this time wisely by learning a new skill or finding online courses they might have an interest in. Now at least they have the luxury of time.”A small number of coaches are still delivering sessions in schools – with physical-distancing rules in force – and the foundation is providing an online healthy eating course for the children to follow.“Our business model changed overnight,” Summers says. “We are usually out in the community delivering football to children and all of a sudden we couldn’t do most of that. But we still have coaches delivering modified activities in six schools and we are very proud of all of how brave they are all being.“Young people and particularly those from a more deprived background are really going to struggle as these weeks go on. Often they are in crammed accommodation with no garden, potentially living in environments where everyone is not getting on harmoniously.“If this goes on for a lot longer then tensions are going to build as young people are missing out on their opportunity to play football or see their friends. There’s a melting pot of problems that could blow up so hopefully programmes like ours can help.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people. Just don’t expect any free drinks.Online rendezvous: Salon London livestreamed a book club where online audiences engage in Q\u0026ampAs with authors such as Emma Jane Unsworth.Personal trainer Joe Wicks has done a sterling job marshalling the nation’s cooped-up urchins into doing kangaroo hops at 9am. To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen’s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet’s Tamara Rojo’s Facebook classes.Online rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.In recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events. When sci-fi thriller The Invisible Man hit streaming platforms, director Leigh Whannell held a Twitter live group-watch answering viewers’ questions in a virtual Q\u0026ampA afterwards.Ever wanted to learn how to spoon carve? Master the oboe? Speak the Cyrillic alphabet from A to Я? There’s never been a better time to pick up new skills as specialists everywhere dispense their wisdom via one-on-one video tuition. A quick online search should throw up a willing tutor for whatever whimsy you have, whether it’s cake decorating, choir practice or Colombian cookery. Meanwhile, InterPals, My Language Exchange and Italki pairs anybody eager to learn a language with a native speaker on Skype or FaceTime.Online rendezvous: Over on Zoom, Cocktails After Dark features out-of-work bartenders teaching viewers how to make drinks (plus earning much-needed tips in the process). And MasterClass features video classes from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Serena Williams, Werner Herzog, Annie Leibovitz, Aaron Sorkin, Herbie Hancock and Neil Gaiman.Travel might be on pause at the moment, but people are still globetrotting vicariously. An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times. Fire up the three-hour-long Sailing to Tobago YouTube video on your laptop, fix quarantini-inspired rum cocktails and stream a destination-appropriate calypsoyacht rock playlist and you’ll be gliding (imaginary) crystalline Caribbean waters in no time.“I’ll find a way to deal with the ennui,” declared Christine and the Queens recently. Her method was throwing herself into near-daily live performances from a Paris studio on Instagram. Other musicians have been livestreaming shows, too, such as Neil Young, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, Charli XCX and more. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s #TogetherAtHome concert series has featured John Legend and Chris Martin. A virtual Live Aid-style charity concert is surely in the offing.Online rendezvous: New York’s politan Opera House has been livestreaming an opera every night on its website.Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWhile we’re stuck indoors, it’s never been more important to keep connected with your friends and family.

When I’m really up against a wall (which is to say, after four minutes), the only thing that keeps me going is listening to Maniac and imagining I’m that gorilla in a paddling pool. So I approached this with a closed mind, and discarded a lot of podcasts because they were too woo-hoo, or because you had to listen to them before you run (“no headphones” is a typical mindful runner’s instruction), or because the person had an annoying voice. Finally, I settled on The Milestone Pursuit podcast, by a likable blokey Londoner, Steve Hobbs. He didn’t sound at all spiritual he sounded like a person who would help you with your bike if your chain came off.He has one mindful episode that I’ve listened to seven or eight times. Total convert. But full disclosure: I’ve never got to the end. It lasts 36 minutes, and I still don’t run for that long. So it’s partly suspense that keeps me going back.The first principle is, as you would expect, exist in this lap: don’t think about the ones you’ve done, or the ones you’re going to do. Hobbs is running while he records, so you can hear the labour in his voice, the wind picking up and dropping off. It’s strangely calming once you know you can’t get away from it. Concentrate on bits of your body, one at a time. Your feet. We don’t really talk about our feet, unless they hurt, Hobbs observes. This is a fine approach to the body, in my view don’t talk about it unless it hurts. But we talk about our glutes all the time, he continues. True. My answer to this is to talk less about our glutes. Why am I silently arguing with the mindful running coach? I don’t know, it’s just who I am. We do a few more body parts, and 10 minutes have gone by. They went by much faster than they usually do, but this could just be a trick of the new. We move on to eyeline if you can look 50 metres ahead, your brain will assess obstacles without really troubling your conscious mind, and you’ll find you can clear curbs and manholes, and suchlike, without having to think about it. That’s all well and good, I think, but now I’m no longer living in the moment. I’m living 50 metres ahead. I’m arguing with the voice again. I never used to argue with Maniac.Around the 19-minute mark, I was really huffing and puffing, nearing the end of my stamina, but this was when I noticed something odd it wasn’t that I felt fitter or any less out of breath than normal, but I felt detached: like my body was going through some arduous event, but I was floating above it, completely in control I could ask it to continue, or I could allow it to stop, and either of those outcomes would simply happen, at my command. I don’t want to sound woo-hoo myself, but it was really quite different to my usual experience, which is of total enslavement to my physical limits. Anyway, not wishing to push the point, so far I’ve just stopped when I’m tired. But with a light heart.All the breathing ideas you’re taught – in for four paces, out for four paces, in through your nose, out through your mouth – are wrong. Breathe how you like. This was a revelation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/942aff2899e22430706f01ff1c62892197b2bb73/0_0_6305_3785/master/6305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=237808a1c301de4bc8d55668304b8b49","title":"pandemic nesters what its like to move back with your parents during lockdown","story":"Some people have found returning to the family home a blessing, but for others it has been anything but smooth sailingCovid-19 has reshaped geographic boundaries. It has left many financially distressed. Expatriates have returned from overseas for indefinite periods of time, and vulnerable people require more help than usual. For all these reasons, and many more, adult children have found themselves doing something that might previously have been unthinkable: moving back in with their parents.Some are finding the experience transformative. One woman, who left New York for her parent’s rural home, told me that the space and country air have made her reconsider whether she will ever return to the city. But there are also downsides. “I’m craving male attention more than I ever have before,” she confessed. When flirting over apps stopped cutting it, she wound up ordering a vibrator in an unmarked box, and fended off her younger siblings in order to retrieve it from the mailbox.While some families are redrawing the household rules they grew up with, other adults are finding themselves slipping back into adolescence. Here, four people in very different circumstances share their stories.In December my mother broke her hip. She had an operation, and heart attack after that. She got gangrene in her toes, and she had to go back to the hospital to have them off. She spent three months in hospital. All that transpired just before her 101st birthday, which was the 17th of March.I came here knowing I could get stuck, but at the same time wanting to ensure she had everything in place. I was not really sure what was happening with the coronavirus at that point, because no one was.I was very concerned about setting up the services that she would need, and just being here for her. She was pretty vulnerable at that point. We weren’t sure whether she was going to survive any of this, and she has. She’s gotten stronger.I must admit the first week I was very teary, when I realised I probably wasn’t going to get home. It was difficult for her too, because she had to become used to not being quite as in control of things. But after that first week, having the nurses coming less and less, it’s really been very good.We just live day by day and we live very happily most of the time. It’s not so much a routine – I do the shopping, but she’s very very self-sufficient. We just flow with it. We do get dressed in the morning though.This is the longest period we’ve been together, really since I left home at the age of 18. We use the opportunity to talk a lot of the time, about her history. We do our own things too, we might watch television, I do a bit of gardening. I appreciate that my mother is so sparky. She has courage, and I think that’s wonderful. Even though I hanker for being home, I haven’t been down all that much.I spent eight years looking after my husband. The last two years, when he was really gravely ill, were very difficult. He died last September. This was thrown at me a couple of months later, so the grieving process has been disrupted. But I feel stronger. He was a brilliant man, and we had a wonderful life together. I listen to a lot of podcasts now, and it reminds me of the intellectual conversations I used to have with my husband.I’ve well and truly left my teenage stage behind, and I’m quite grateful for that. It would be quite terrible if I was here, and my mother was running after me, like she keeps promising to do. She keeps saying to me, ‘Well I should be doing something for you.’ It probably would have been very confronting if I’d done this forty years ago. Now I appreciate how precious this time we have together is.When you move back in with your parents, you work out a way to not be there as much. You basically just sleep there. I moved back in with my mother temporarily right before Christmas. I was planning to move out again when the World Health Organisation declared a pandemic. I remember the date, it was 12 March. My stepdad is very unwell, and so I called my work and started to organise working from home.My parents thought they were doing the social distancing thing, but they don’t understand how to do it. My mum kept going to work, and my stepdad kept doing “retired man stuff”, like going to lunch. The day they closed the restaurants, they had a dinner party here. I’d been inside for two weeks already, so I was pretty tense. No one washed their hands. It was really messy. Some guests had just got back from overseas. People were sharing food with their hands. I remember muttering to my mum: “Well we’re all dead”. Some people are not taking this situation seriously enough. I can safely say I’m taking it too seriously. They’re better at social distancing now though.I work in the arts, and I’ve lost my job now. I sleep how cave rats sleep, in four hour blocks. It’s been tense. I’m drinking a lot more. But I’m sure there are people much worse off.Now we’re all forced to be with each other all the time, there’s been a lot of arguing. Bringing up stuff that was there for a long time that we’ve never discussed. Sometimes it’s things that happened 20 years ago.I’m cleaning a lot more and I’m a better house guest now. But because I started early, I now feel very nihilistic. If someone invited me to a party now, I would probably go – but now everyone’s taking it seriously. I feel like I got in too early, like I’ve been social distancing for six months.My mental health is in the toilet. As far as us all living with each other, I think they’re being pretty patient with how bananas I’ve gone. But I also love to complain. Really, it’s fine.I came back to Australia for a fellowship, to launch my book and to check up on family and spend time with them. I was supposed to be here until the end of March. When the lockdowns started happening, I thought ‘should I try and get an earlier flight?’I decided to stay here, and given everything that’s happened, I think I’ve made the right choice. I live alone back in Manchester and I haven’t lived with my parents in about 12 years, so it’s been an adjustment.My parents also look after my nephew and niece, so they spend a lot of time with them, and I do as well. But my parents also give me a lot of space. I’ll remember my lockdown as a time of trashy gay romance novels and TikTok. My work is quite emotionally draining, and it’s been a wonderful escape.Given that there’s been so many stories about people in lockdown with abusive partners or parents, especially in the context of LGBTIQ people, I am so lucky. My parents don’t police my behaviour, or ask me to do too much.My parents have always done a lot of domestic stuff, and never expected or asked us to do it. I try to help out, and my parents are like ‘Why are you doing this?’ My mum gets quite upset if I say thank you – she says, ‘Why are you thanking me? I’m not a stranger, I’m your mother.’ It’s endearing but also reflects a cultural dynamic that I think other families don’t really have, in terms of how parents relate to their kids when they’re back home.In some ways it’s been like becoming a teenager again. I’ve certainly become more lazy, given the inability to go out.I was meant to move overseas in late April. I had been working to pack my life up, and live with my parents for a bit, but that got brought forward. I have Type 1 diabetes and as news reports started to come in, I was freaking out about having contact with anything to do with coronavirus. I was meant to live here for a month and basically, I haven’t moved out. I don’t really want to interact with the world.We all agreed to follow the same level of restrictions, to limit it coming into the house. If there’s outside interaction there’s a process, if there’s a delivery, there’s a cleaning process. My parents have compromised to meet that level of restriction.I feel really lucky. As a freelancer not having to pay rent has been a plus, since my work has been affected. I’m doing all the cooking because I’m not paying rent. I’ve also been doing work round the house to try and contribute – those are suggestions I’ve made, they didn’t ask that of me, but it’s been received well.But my parents are Boomers and we don’t agree in terms of politics and world views, so conversation’s not great. But we’ve agreed to have dinner together every night. I definitely think there’s elements of regression, but I’m hopefully better at dealing with them now, given I’m 33. I definitely don’t feel good about myself when I can sense there’s a learned frustration that hasn’t been worked through.We’re way out in the suburbs. There’s some space in the house, so I can walk away. But I can’t just leave if it gets tense, so I’m being more amicable. I call on my friends a lot more, in terms of calls and texts, so I can get social contact from other places.My plans to move overseas are probably not going to happen now, so I’m in a transient phase. I’m mentally struggling with the isolation, that’s been the hardest thing to deal with. I don’t think before Covid I would ever have done a video call, but that’s been really helpful for me in terms of staying sane.At this point I’m planning to be here probably until at least July. My parents are really happy for me to be here, because they’ve been concerned from the start from a health perspective. I’m lucky that they’re comfortable with me staying, until we move into whatever a new normal life looks like.*Names have been changed"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e06d0959464f8233f885e7725b9e04a9ca1566d/0_0_1795_1701/master/1795.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=be514e0f8c0a8c55637e5699021db5ad 1290w","title":"ebay enjoys lockdown renaissance as buyers and sellers flock to site","story":"Up to 50,000 new sellers have signed up in April, with fast trade in everything from home office supplies to baking kit and dumbbells to hot tubsMore than 50,000 new businesses have signed up to the UK arm of online trading site eBay in April as independent retailers seek a way to survive through lockdown.Hardware and toy stores to fashion boutiques and brands have turned to the site as a means to keep trading since the government forced all retailers deemed non-essential to close their doors on 23 March to help slow the spread of coronavirus.Even big fashion brands are signing up to the site as a way to clear spring stock that will never make it into stores. Up to 80 have already signed up and Rob Hattrell, the boss of eBay’s UK arm, says the company is poised to sign up more in the coming weeks.“Businesses are trying to find a way to survive,” says Hattrell.Shopper numbers on eBay have doubled as families switch to buying online rather than giving up on spending altogether.But Hattrell says it’s a mistake to think that all online sellers are doing well: “It’s not consistent or broad brush it is category specific,” he says.Before lockdown started, sales of medical products such as face masks and hand sanitiser soared. Since then, there have been different waves of demand moving from home office supplies, such as laptops and desks, to games and puzzles for children, through to fitness equipment, home-baking kit and, finally, in recent weeks, signs of a return to buying clothing.But not everything is selling well – firms selling party accessories or car parts have had to mothball their eBay stores because business is so slow.Meanwhile, eBay has removed more than 15m listings around the world and suspended thousands of traders amid concerns about unscrupulous sellers trying to cash in on demand for some items, such as face masks and sanitiser.Hattrell says listings for masks, baby milk, nappies and hand sanitiser are now limited to major firms, which have got special approval from eBay.While some scammers are still slipping through the net – such as those posting fake listings for camper vans to trick buyers into handing over cash for vehicles they have not seen and don’t exist – Hattrell says the company has doubled its team who oversee rogue traders and is constantly tweaking computer algorithms to try and spot rip-offs.“I don’t want it on the platform. We have a community of 27m buyers and 300,000 small businesses and they don’t want it either.”While many are concerned that the surge in online shopping will only add fuel to the high street meltdown, Hattrell argues that getting to grips with trading online will help independent retailers in the long term.“Having physical and online running together is the most compelling thing for customers. These things don’t have to work in competition,” he says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de62e18a11b7ea1f5e8c53c6f451fd715cd7862e/0_494_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58fdcde67dbfef0ccef0a392a26c216c","title":"gardening lockdown buy plants ops garden centres websites","story":"I’m interested in growing things, but don’t know which shops, garden centres or websites to go toEvery week a  Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.Like many other people I’ve got a new interest in gardening, but I don’t know where to get seeds and other supplies.

Readers share their concernsAlmost one in five UK mortgage holders have now been granted a payment holiday, it was estimated this week – but people’s experiences of the process have been very different. Some struggled to get a holiday while others say it was almost too easy. And while for some it will add just a few pounds to their monthly mortgage bill, others say their outlay will rise by a lot more. asked readers who had applied for a mortgage payment holiday, or help with other debts, how they got on. Almost 200 people contacted us to tell us their stories.Here we look at their main concerns and provide essential need-to-know information and expert advice for anyone considering a mortgage holiday.The increases people face vary hugely. One reader, a Londoner who is currently out of work because of a brain tumour, said he called his bank to explain he was struggling, and that the tenant in his buy-to-let flat had stopped paying rent, and was instantly told he could take a three-month mortgage holiday.But he added: “I was shocked to be told that the ‘holiday’ is no such thing – merely a pause, after which my payments would increase by nearly £200 per month … When I pointed out that a true holiday would be to extend the life of the mortgage by three months and not increase payments, I got a very frosty response.”David Porter, who works in IT and also lives in London, also deferred his mortgage payments for three months. His home loan has 14 years left to run. “The payment break will add about £20 a month to my mortgage, which seems manageable, but of course this will all add up over the course of the mortgage lifetime,” he said. “If all is well income-wise, I intend to overpay over the next year or two.”Lee Young, 49, who lives in Nottingham and has been furloughed, has a 28-year mortgage with 15 years left to run. The current balance is roughly £60,000 and his current monthly payment is about £350. It will rise by about £5 a month.Perhaps worryingly, quite a few of those who contacted us appeared to have little or no idea how much extra they will have to fork out. Several told us that when they called to ask about a break, their lender had given them no information about how much the new payments would be.Need to know “Payment holiday is a misleading description for what is actually a payment deferment,” says Mark Harris at the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients.The standard position at most lenders appears to be that you pay more each month in the future, while the term stays the same.Typically, lenders are spreading people’s deferred payments over the outstanding term of their mortgage. On top of this, during the holiday, the lender continues to charge interest and adds this to the amount you owe, which increases the balance it charges interest on.As a result your payments will be a bit higher when the holiday ends and there will be a (slightly) bigger total amount to repay.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance indicates the default should be a three-month holiday, though it says firms can offer a shorter period in certain situations.Because the missed payments are being spread over the rest of the mortgage, the shorter the term left on your loan, the larger the monthly rise once the holiday is over.If you change a couple of numbers – reduce the term remaining to seven years and halve the mortgage size to £50,000 – the monthly increase is a lot bigger: £27 (from £655 to £682). That’s £324 extra over a year. In that case the total amount to repay goes up by £195 to £55,219.However, let’s now assume the mortgage is interest-only rather than repayment, but keep the other details the same. In that scenario, the monthly increase is very small: £2 for the £100,000 loan and £1 for the £50,000 one.According to Martin Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert, the “vast majority” of mortgage holiday applicants are being told their monthly payments will increase by less than £50.The UK’s official Money Advice Service says: “Your lender should explain the impact of any option on your monthly payments.” So if you have not been told this information, you must ask for it. MoneySuperMarket’s website has an easy-to-use payment holiday calculator that will give you a good idea of the increase.Many people told us they had been informed that taking a payment holiday would not affect their credit rating – though some were worried this might not be the case.Luke May, 31, who lives in Derbyshire, said he and his partner were coming up to their first year in their first home together, and have had to defer their mortgage payments for three months. “My partner will need a new car soon, and we are due to remortgage next year – we are worried our good credit scores will not be enough to secure better deals,” he said.Need to know The government, the FCA and lenders have all stated that taking a payment holiday will not affect an inidual’s credit rating. But remember that while the UK’s credit reference agencies hold the data that makes up someone’s credit score, these bodies do not decide whether someone can obtain credit – that is up to inidual lenders, who are free to choose to whom they wish to lend. If you are expecting to apply for any kind of credit in the next couple of years, the fact you took a break may limit your options.Again, some were concerned about whether taking a payment holiday may have an adverse impact when they later come to switch their mortgage to another firm or want to increase their borrowing. Jim, a 42-year-old train driver from Kent who has been furloughed from work, told us: “Hopefully it will not affect any future borrowing. However, you never know with the banks. The proof will be in the pudding when we go to remortgage.”Need to know Mortgage holders on payment holidays can switch to a new deal offered by their existing lender at the end of their term, but it’s not so simple when it comes to remortgaging to another lender.Chris Sykes, a consultant at the mortgage broker Private Finance, says if you require new finance in the next six months – a remortgage with a new lender, say – a payment holiday will make your application less likely to be accepted.He told Money that while some lenders are becoming more flexible, “others who are more reserved in terms of what they lend … would look unfavourably on you having a payment holiday”.It’s fair to say that using a mortgage broker may not be a bad move, as they will have a good idea about which lenders are most likely to be accommodating.This is clearly a worry for many – though it may be that the holidays are extended beyond three months.Joanna, a freelance writer in Edinburgh, was granted a payment holiday on her mortgage and on two bank loans.She fears more debt when the crisis is over. “I know I will struggle to get work again when things calm down, and it will take me months to get back on my feet – but all these banks and utility providers will come for their money in three months. It is giving me sleepless nights and chronic anxiety.”Need to know The FCA says that at the end of the holiday, if you are still not able to make your full payments due to the crisis, your lender may, if appropriate, offer you a further payment holiday or other assistance.Citizens Advice points out that at the moment your mortgage provider should not try to repossess your home, and should pause any action it is already taking until at least 18 June 2020.It’s not too late to ask for one, but Sykes says his view is that if you can avoid applying for one, do.

The war in Europe had ended and weather prospects were no longer an official secret. The Met Office, an arm of the War Office, was so strategically important that at the outbreak of hostilities it was moved out of London to protect it from bombing.In heavily camouflaged huts, forecasters set up on Dunstable Downs, Bedfordshire, and were linked to Q Central, the British war communications centre at nearby Leighton Buzzard. Throughout WWII until VE Day, via Q Central, forecasters receiving reports from many sources, including British ships crossing the Atlantic, produced updated weather forecasts as frequently as every half hour. The accuracy of these was vital to inform military operations – most famously D-Day, but more usually, for the RAF – details of cloud cover to aid the defence of Britain and later for Allied bombing raids.So important was the weather to the war effort that all general forecasts were banned. Farmers and anyone else who needed to know what the elements might throw at them were forced to use their own observations or fall back on folklore. For these groups of people the resumption of forecasts on VE Day must have been particularly welcome.

There is, though, some evidence that people who have asthma and catch the coronavirus are more likely to go on to have a more severe case of Covid-19. There is yet to be any data which shows how asthma impacts on the mortality rate from the coronavirus, but doctors are advising that people with the condition try to manage their asthma symptoms as best they can in case they catch the coronavirus.Asthma is a condition of the airwaves, causing inflammation of the airwaves. It can lead to wheezing, coughing and a tight chest, and be triggered both by internal factors in the body, like levels of hormones, and external factors, like viruses, pollution and allergens. Colds and flu are considered a major trigger.The data shows 8,196 more deaths at home in England, Wales and Scotland compared with the five-year average for this time of year, including 6,546 non-Covid deaths. It also indicates a drop in non-Covid deaths in hospital, however, leading experts to conclude that many who would ordinarily have been admitted to a ward and died there are instead dying at home.Jason Oke, a statistician with the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences at the University of Oxford, said: “This would mean fewer deaths from other causes in hospitals and more deaths from other causes at home or in care homes. It is of course possible that, in addition to this, Covid-19 is being missed in people who remain outside of hospital.“A third explanation is that people are dying of other causes that would not have happened under normal conditions – and are collateral damage of the lockdown.” He added that there was no way of knowing for sure based on the available data.Doctors’ leaders have warned that some sick people are too scared to go to hospital and are aware that much of the usual NHS care had been suspended in the pandemic. “These figures underline that the devastation wrought by Covid-19 spreads far beyond the immediate effects of the illness itself,” said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the council chair of the British Medical Association.“While all parts of the NHS have rallied round in a bid to meet the immediate rocketing demand caused by the pandemic, more than half of doctors in a recent BMA survey have told us that this is worsening the care of non-Covid patients.”“Referrals from GPs are not being accepted unless for serious medical conditions and routine investigations to aid diagnosis are not available in many cases. This means many ill patients are not getting the care they so desperately need now – and crucially, risking their conditions getting worse and with some even dying as a result,” Nagpaul added.Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said excess community deaths from non-Covid causes had been seen across Europe. A report this week found that there had been about 11,600 such fatalities in Italy during its pandemic, including deaths from heart attacks and strokes, he added.“Data from other countries has shown delayed presentation in patients with heart attacks during the pandemic, either because people don’t want to burden the health service at the current time, or because of fear of catching Covid-19. It is critical that patients who are worried they may be having a heart attack or stroke should call 999.”The fatality figures from the  analysis of the England and Wales data are based on the date of occurrence rather than on the date of registration.The number of deaths occurring in care homes in England and Wales in the week to 24 April was 3.1 times the toll in the equivalent week over the past five years, while deaths in private homes and in hospitals were up to 1.5 times higher than typically seen in the same week.Over the course of the past seven weeks, there were 23,583 deaths in people’s homes compared with the five-year average of 16,794. But of the extra 6,789 fatalities, just one in four were attributed to coronavirus, leaving 5,355 excess non-Covid deaths.Similar data from Scotland – which is based on date of registration rather than date of the death occurring and is more up to date – shows a similar trend. In the seven weeks to 3 May, there were 3,453 deaths in private homes and non-institutional settings in Scotland. This compares with 2,046 in a typical year. However, of the remaining deaths, just 216 were Covid-related, leaving 1,191 excess deaths.Similarly, 32,633 deaths were recorded in care homes in England and Wales, more than twice the figure typically expected at this time of year (15,670). Of the remaining deaths,  just 6,815 were Covid-19 deaths, leaving 10,148 deaths where Covid-19 was not mentioned on the death certificate.While there were 597 excess deaths in Scottish care homes in the seven weeks to 3 May, these are lower than the number of coronavirus-related deaths (1,195).There have been 704 excess deaths in Northern Ireland since the first coronavirus death was registered there. However, Northern Ireland does not currently publish a five-year average of deaths.Excess deaths grew week on week in both care homes and private homes in England and Wales up until the week ending 10 April, but have fallen in the two subsequent weeks for which data is available.David Leon, professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine, said the significant numbers of non-Covid excess deaths in care homes would be down to several factors, including undiagnosed Covid-19 deaths.“People who are dying from other conditions in care homes may be less likely to be admitted to hospital than pre-pandemic due to concerns about strain on resources,” he said. “These deaths are ones that would have occurred regardless of the pandemic, but happened in care homes rather than hospitals.“Finally, there is the concern that some of the deaths in care homes were avoidable – in that some people died because they did not get life-saving treatment in hospitals, because of a reluctance to send them for specialist medical treatment. How big this group is is unclear. It will undoubtedly be the focus of inquiry over the coming months.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d0d8e782f213866d363d6885f8859ead930afe0/0_0_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84512e7086a42113f485c900678ad1a1","title":"im losing my teenage years young contend with life in lockdown coronavirus","story":"Teenagers affirm evidence that suggests they are particularly struggling with coronavirus crisisWhen, in late February, Betsy Sheil turned 16, she thought she was staring down the end of secondary school, not the beginning of global pandemic.“I was going to finish year 11 and do my GCSEs, then I was going to have a really long summer with my friends, hopefully go abroad – have that summer that everyone has.”Weeks later, Betsy was bidding a rushed goodbye to her friends on their last day of school before it closed because of coronavirus.“I’m sad about missing out on the stuff that everyone normally gets to do,” she says. “I didn’t have a proper leavers’ assembly, I didn’t get to properly say bye.”Betsy is now many weeks into isolating with her parents at their family home in Nottingham, her holiday plans scrapped – along with her exams.“I guess you’ve got the hope that the future is not confirmed yet, you don’t know how long it’s going to last – but that’s also what’s confusing about it all. It’s the knowledge that I’m losing my teenage years.” Betsy checks herself before adding: “Well – one or two years, probably.”The coronavirus has affected all our lives, but six weeks since schools shut across the UK there is evidence that teenagers in particular are struggling.A study of 60,000 people in lockdown by University College London found that the youngest in the sample, 18- to 24-year-olds, had the lowest levels of life satisfaction, while the highest was recorded in the over-60s.It is easy to see why that may be the case. Exams young people have been told will shape the rest of their lives have been cancelled, future plans – for work, travel or further study – cast into uncertainty. Incipient independence has been rudely interrupted.Physical distancing goes against adolescent impulse, says Loades: to assert themselves as iniduals, away from their parents to spend time with their friends, to take risks, to act without thinking of consequences.“We’re asking teenagers to be very responsible and mature, and to make sensible decisions for the greater good of society,” she says. “I think that’s probably quite a conflict.”Loades says school leavers in particular will be suffering the loss of milestones such as exams, last-day rituals such as shirt signing and leavers’ assemblies, and end-of-year parties.“Those kinds of experiences help us to make sense of endings that might feel painful and difficult, and to move on from one stage of life to another,” she adds.For many young people, the cancellation of exams comes not as relief, but as anticlimax. “Obviously no one really wants to do exams, but … there were subjects that I knew I could push myself in,” says Betsy.She expects to pass her GCSEs on the strength of her mock exam marks, and is relieved she put in the effort. “You get told that your mock exams don’t mean anything – now it means a lot. For people who were going to try during ‘the real thing’, it’s probably quite hard.”The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Others have already had to adapt to online learning. Charlotte Lewis, 17, from Shropshire, has had her entire timetable moved on to Microsoft Teams before her A-levels next summer. The learning curve has been steep: lessons are dense, self-directed and marred by technical difficulties.“At school you can bounce off each other – it’s a lot harder to do that now,” she says. “We have some teachers who have never used the platform before, so we had to teach them.”Her friend Josh Foster, also 17, says some people have already started muting the teacher and watching Netflix instead. “As long as they’ve logged into class,” she adds.Josh says teachers seem to be overcompensating with homework, forcing him to cram until 2am and seek extensions to keep up. “I feel that we’re quite hindered compared to last year’s year 12s.” Support from both his school and prospective universities has been lacking, he continues. “I’m in a position where I don’t know what to do to have the best chance of getting into a university.”The economic fallout from the pandemic has already darkened the outlook for the 800,000 school leavers and graduates in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank predicts that the “corona class of 2020” are the group most at risk of unemployment, and face long-term damage to their career and pay prospects.Ava Twomey, 17, from south London, is having to reckon with her chosen industry going into freefall, just as she finished her Btec qualification.She has dreamed of working as an airline cabin crew member since she was 13. “I really love travelling, airplanes, airports – I’m a bit obsessed.” British Airways was her first choice, after she did work experience there last year and “fell in love”.But BA has been upended by the collapse in aviation, and recently set out plans to make up to 12,000 staff redundant. “It’s not looking too good at the moment,” says Ava, “but I’m trying to stay positive.”Exercise helped, until she overdid the running and tore her tendon now she FaceTimes her friends and binge-watches Made in Chelsea and The Only Way Is Essex. “It’s just so comforting,” she says apologetically.Many teenagers have sought solace in Netflix. Betsy is storming through Gossip Girl at a rate of 2.5 series a week. Charlotte and her friends have watched the Twilight and Harry Potter films together using the Netflix Party app (“She made me watch Clueless,” says Josh, grumbling).They used to go to Wetherspoons to do their homework, says Charlotte now they gather on FaceTime and Zoom. “We’re just doing what we normally do, but online.”Tope Olufemi, 19 , abruptly returned from his first year at the University of Warwick to his parents’ home in north London. He says screen time has gone “through the roof. People are on social media 247.”Jakob McMaster, 17, from Belfast, has found it harder to adapt. He used to spend his days at school or outdoors, exploring abandoned buildings and forests with his friends.“I don’t think I’ve stayed inside the house this long since I was 12 … We thrive off being outside.”He has also been separated from his boyfriend of one year, who attends the same school. Before lockdown, the longest they had been apart was three days.Two months into isolating with his parents and younger siblings, Jakob says he feels bored and uncharacteristically irritable, like “time is merging together”.“I get peaks of motivation where it’s like: ‘I have all the time in the world, I should start baking!.’ But as soon as I get the stuff ready for it, I’m like: ‘This is meaningless – we’re just stuck here.’”Jakob has had weekly therapy since he was 11, but now his sessions have been put on hold. He has noticed the impact of the loss of support and being confined on his depression: “I have the kind that makes me want to bounce off the walls.”The combination of being siloed with their family and separated from their friends has many young people living inside a pressure cooker, says Loades.Her review of 63 studies on isolation and loneliness in teenagers suggested physical distancing was likely to put them at higher risk of depression, and probably anxiety. The longer the lockdown restrictions go on, the worse outcomes are likely to lead to, says Loades.The long-term effects of isolation on teenagers will differ greatly by inidual,as well as factors such as access to technology, amount of personal space and relationship with their family, says says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit at the University of Cambridge. “We can already see inequalities arising.”Orben predicts that teenagers will at least find being apart from their peers a negative experience. “The importance of the social world for adolescents can’t be overstated,” she says.For some teenagers, the isolation coronavirus has caused is nothing new. Last year, research by the charity Mencap found one in three young people with a learning disability spend less than an hour outside their home on a typical Saturday.Joey Mander, 21, is an NHS sterile services technician and youth activist in Coventry. He hopes one silver lining of the pandemic is recognition that “for some of us, this is just our ordinary”. At 16 he was diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a rare genetic mutation, and now uses a wheelchair.He says the restriction and loss of autonomy “the world has been forced to experience, is the very thing that people” with a disability face as part of their day-to-day experience.For Mander, who also has autism, the pandemic has disrupted his routines and led to a cut in the hours of his support worker just as own his job has become more high-pressured than ever. “I’m having to fight very hard to get through each day.”He has found solace in drawing – he is adapting Rosie the Riveter to show “a person in scrubs like mine” – and CYA Saturdays, a group of young disability advocates, now meeting twice weekly on Zoom. “I just want to touch someone’s hand. That’s what I keep saying,” says Mander.Loades says it is important for teenagers to know coronavirus is a challenge for everyone – and that within that there may be opportunity to gain new perspectives, skills and maturity. Her previous research, on the experience of isolation by young people with chronic illness, has shown that “through adversity comes strength”.Some teenagers are using lockdown to challenge themselves and support their family. Betsy often cooks dinner, and bakes “just for something to do”. Ava says she appreciates her friendships more, and has enjoyed the extra bonding time with her parents: “I’ve learnt more about them as people.”Charlotte and her friends are each keeping journals on a different aspect of life during a pandemic: “It’s going to be quite interesting to look back and tell the kids about.”She is interested in going into journalism, and coronavirus has proved a crash course in media literacy. “We’re thinking: is what we’re being told scaremongering? Is it actually as serious as they’re saying, or more serious?”For Tope, the lockdown has reinforced the importance of politics. “Even though it’s not affecting us equally, it’s affecting all of us.” He has been talking about the government response and mismanagement scandals with his friends. “A lot of people are realising that politics affects you on a daily basis, even if it doesn’t feel like it.”With many teenagers concerned for their essential-worker parents or elderly parents, the stakes of the crisis are not lost on them. Nor is it the fact that it will pass – and sooner, if they follow the rules.Betsy says most people she knows have been adhering to physical distancing. When one posted on social media about meeting up with their friends, the response was of anger.“There was a lot of: ‘What do you not understand about not going out?’” she says. “A lot of people got quite vocal, just the ignorance of it. “Obviously the more people that go out, the longer we’re in it.”Betsy is already looking forward to the party that will be thrown once this is all over. For now, she says: “Me not being able to hang out with my friends is not the biggest problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6173626e5e4e6db78594630cfbd1d2c55ec7a2d/0_303_4739_2845/master/4739.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=99a327dd48215df162a9c2c700e9b640","title":"the last dance michael jordan netflix","story":"The hit docuseries on Michael Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls scores big as entertainment, but journalistic compromises make it little more than longform branded contentNot long after ESPN scored its first ever Academy Award for Ezra Edelman’s nonpareil OJ: Made in America, a masterclass in longform investigative journalism that drew comparisons to Mailer and Caro, the network announced another multi-part documentary series centering on an American sports icon. The Last Dance, a 10-part film jointly produced with Netflix, promised an unvarnished deep e into one of the most transformative stars and feted dynasties in the history of sports: Michael Jordan and the 1990s Chicago Bulls.The anticipation only mounted with the release of a glossy extended trailer at Christmas that teased never-before-seen footage and a star-studded roster of interviewees – Barack Obama! Justin Timberlake! – along with the participation of Jordan himself, who has spoken only sparingly about the Bulls’ imperious reign and dumbfounding break-up in the two decades since his playing days. Initially slated for a June release alongside this year’s NBA finals, ESPN swiftly moved up the premiere date to April after the coronavirus pandemic went scorched earth on its spring programming schedule.As entertainment, it has delivered in almost every imaginable way. Buoyed by the narcotic allure of nostalgia, the slick blend of archival footage, present-day interviews and spare-no-expense soundtrack breathes fresh life into even the most familiar plot points of Jordan’s trajectory from precocious amateur to larger-than-life symbol both overexposed and mysterious. It is one of the few American sports yarns worthy of such a sprawling canvas and the episodes have become appointment television on Sunday nights throughout the past month, averaging a massive-for-today six million viewers over the first six installments ahead of their next-day release internationally on Netflix. Turns out even the opening notes of Sirius by the Alan Parsons Project, the instrumental backdrop for the Bulls’ player introductions and perhaps the closest US analogue to the All Blacks’ haka for spine-tingling pregame pageantry, are still enough to elicit chills after all these years.But as journalism, regrettably, The Last Dance borders on malpractice. What ESPN has declined to mention during its breathless promotional blitz is that Jordan’s own production company, Jump 23, is among the co-producers behind the project – a fact you wouldn’t know from the closing credits, from which it has been notably omitted. Among the few to seize on this detail amid the film’s deliriously enthusiastic public reception has been the venerable American documentarian Ken Burns, who described the arrangement as “the opposite direction of where we need to be going” to the Wall Street Journal this week. “If you are there influencing the very fact of it getting made it means that certain aspects that you don’t necessarily want in aren’t going to be in, period,” Burns said. “And that’s not the way you do good journalism ... and it’s certainly not the way you do good history, my business.”ESPN’s failure to disclose what amounts to Jordan’s retaining final cut of its film might not stand out as an ethical sticking point had it been put forth as a point-of-view piece in the spirit of, say, 2002’s The Kid Stays in the Picture, which leaves it to the viewer to parse the truth from Robert Evans’ unreliable narrator. But The Last Dance has instead been presented as a definitive account, even as it is compromised by the defects and biases inherent in any authorized biography, with little regard for those cast as villains (even if they’re not alive to give their side).Of course, concessions were necessary for the project to even get off the ground. The more than 500 hours of behind-the-scenes footage from Jordan’s titular final season with the Bulls, which comprises the narrative spine of The Last Dance, has only seen the light of day because of a pact between the star and the NBA’s in-house entertainment ision: that any of it could only be used with his explicit consent. As commissioner Adam Silver recalled to (who else?) ESPN: “Our agreement will be that neither one of us can use this footage without the other’s permission.”After many refusals to many pitches over many years, Jordan finally agreed to a proposal in 2016. (That he reportedly gave the go-ahead literally days after LeBron James’ famous NBA finals comeback win over the Golden State Warriors, which reignited the pan-cultural Jordan v LeBron debate in earnest, may have proven serendipitous timing.)The choice between the thinly veiled hagiography of The Last Dance and no film at all is an easy one. Jordan’s near-psychopathic competitive streak, a sort of Daniel Plainview in high tops, has been exhaustively documented, but watching a 57-year-old man reflect on that image and weigh in on decades-old scores is undeniably compelling theater. Still, allowing the subject to have final review and editorial control all but ensures the most ambitious promises of The Last Dance can never be fulfilled.What’s been billed as a warts-and-all chronicle doesn’t quite gloss over the less pleasant elements of Jordan’s legacy, long the fodder of whisper networks and urban legend, but he addresses them entirely on his terms. Story arcs on his compulsive gambling habit and tyrannical proclivities with teammates can appear problematic at the outset, but come off looking forgivable in the end. For the first time Jordan opens up about his infamous “Republicans buy sneakers, too” apoliticism – a trait which has not aged especially well amid the post-Kaepernick resurgence of athlete activism – yet the filmmakers apparently didn’t think it was worth speaking with Craig Hodges, a key contributor on the first two of Jordan’s six championship teams who has been among his most vocal critics on the subject – a conspicuous omission given the more than 100 people in Jordan’s orbit that were interviewed. We are left with the unshakeable sensation that we’re not getting the straight dope, rather seeing Jordan as he wants to be seen.This is less than an indictment of the filmmakers and more a commentary of our media climate. As much as we’d love to see this material in the hands of a Pennebaker or Burns or Asif Kapadia, that’s simply a non-starter in an age where the titans of sports and entertainment can bypass traditional channels to control the narrative through their own production companies or friendly platforms like the Players’ Tribune, a trend which Jordan, it must be said, was decades ahead of the curve on. And ESPN, a rightsholder which pays billions of dollars annually to broadcast NBA games, is hardly the lone culprit in the blurring of journalism and entertainment: Look no further than the Verheoven-flecked pantomime on offer at Fox News or Jeff Zucker’s cringeworthy handiwork at CNN, where the promos for presidential debates, once beamed into America’s living rooms as a public service, wouldn’t feel out of place on Monday Night Raw.Which is all to say The Last Dance might feel like a missed opportunity if there were even an opportunity to miss anymore. It may not be the prestige journalism that ESPN would be happy for it to be mistaken for, but in the newly arrived genre of longform branded content you could do a whole lot worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9480ed5e4d7047d33ef5061231443d4363a101a7/0_1051_5988_3592/master/5988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff643d2b211d9c5e98f22986b496a1cd","title":"tv tonight the many faces of peter sellers","story":"On the 40th anniversary of the comic actor’s death, a new documentary looks back at his life and legacy.

It is part of a global campaign to pay homage to 25-year-old Arbery, nicknamed Maud, who was shot and killed by two white men while out jogging in Georgia. Ahmaud was born on 8 May 1994 and would have turned 26 on Friday.The idea for a global run in Arbery’s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running. Now, the hashtag #IRunWithMaud has travelled the world, with runners from London to New York completing the 2.23-mile trip – a tribute to the date of his death, which occurred on 23 February. The hashtag now has more than 60,000 posts on Instagram.The worldwide run follows news this morning that Arbery’s killers will face murder charges over the attack. Gregory and Travis McMichael told officers they thought Arbery resembled a suspect in a series of nearby break-ins. The pair were charged with murder and aggravated assault.Police were aware of the crime for more than two months but did not charge the McMichaels until after the shooting gained widespread attention. When video footage of Arbery’s killing circulated online, celebrities such as LeBron James and Naomi Campbell called for justice, as well as politicians Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.“Exercising while black should not be a death sentence,” said Harris in a tweet on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/491a5067512d5d7904c54e250de36a52b4c2978d/0_52_4810_2888/master/4810.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68972cc0ac38bb28a2ecfdfac1358788","title":"coronavirus face mask exercise outside","story":"It’s important to get fresh air and exercise – but do we need to wear masks while running, walking and cycling? We asked some expertsTo mask or not to mask while getting fresh air is the question many of us are asking ourselves. According to the CDC, we should wear masks in “areas of significant community-based transmission”, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. While the CDC doesn’t list the outdoors as a high-density space, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s OK to exercise outdoors mask-free.Because breathing harder may release more virus into the air, Ben Levine, physician and director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, told NPR we should double our distance while exercising outside.Alex McDonald In short, yes. Taking deeper and harder breaths when exercising likely causes more viral shedding, especially if exercising outside where the wind can blow and dissipate the virus. Taking that into consideration, it is likely that due to increased viral shedding iniduals that are exercising should probably be more than 6ft apart.Jessalyn Adam We don’t have an answer. The recommendation of staying at least 6ft apart under normal circumstances is actually based on what we know about the flu. While coronavirus behaves differently, we’re doing our best to make inferences.That said, experts are recommending that while running you stay at least 13ft away from others. To minimize the risk as much as you can, put as much space between yourself and others as possible while biking.Adam If you’re totally alone or just with people from your own household then that’s fine to go without. However, if there are other people on the trail, wear your mask as you approach and while passing and do your best to try to put as much space as you can between you and the other person. If the terrain doesn’t allow you to put a lot of distance between yourself and the other person, turn away while passing so you’re breathing in the opposite direction.If you’re just passing another person and particularly if you’re just walking and not breathing heavily then I think it’s pretty low-risk.Kelley Vargo The purpose of the mask is more to prevent you from spreading the virus as opposed to keeping you from getting it. If you are feeling sick or “off” you should forgo going on a public trail. Consider exercising at home until you’re feeling OK, because this isn’t just about protecting yourself from the virus – we also don’t want to infect other people.Vargo Training with a mask, especially a homemade mask or an N95 mask will not replicate the effects of altitude training. If you really want to get an edge on your cardiovascular performance as it relates to altitude training, you should train at high altitude.Responses were edited for length and clarity"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/940397bd68d82fb56cf4f757a9011fb3ec26ac3b/0_145_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf7551dcda1107ec8dc1bedd44804d95","title":"irish native american coronavirus historic bond","story":"The list of recent donors reads like an Irish phone book. Aisling Ní Chuimín, Shane Ó Leary, Sean Gibbons, Kevin Boyle, Kevin Keane, Clare Quinn, Eamonn McDonald, on and on down a GoFundMe page that by Friday had raised $3.15m of a $5m goal.The inidual amounts are not remarkable – $10, $20, $30, some exceeding $100 – but the story behind the donations stretches back two centuries and encompasses a singular act of generosity that forged a bond between Native Americans and Ireland, a bond now renewed in the coronavirus era.In 1847 the Choctaw nation set aside its own impoverishment and suffering to make a $170 donation to victims of the Irish famine. The tribe had suffered grievously during its Trail of Tears, a forced relocation to Oklahoma, and empathised with Irish people enduring misery and starvation more than 4,000 miles away.The generosity left a lasting mark on Ireland, which remembers it through art and commemorations.Now Irish people are reciprocating by donating to a fund for Navajo and Hopi communities hit by Covid-19.“A beautiful act of solidarity from our friends in Ireland, who remember the kindness shown to them by our Choctaw brothers and sisters, who sent them aid during the great potato famine in 1847. Thank you so much, Ireland!!!” wrote Ethel Branch, one of the fund organisers.“The favour is returned through generous donations from the Irish people to the Navajo Nation during our time of crisis. Thank you, Ireland, for showing solidarity and being here for us,” wrote Vanessa Tully, another organiser.Adversity often brings out the best in people, the Choctaw tribe said in a statement. “We are gratified – and perhaps not at all surprised – to learn of the assistance our special friends, the Irish, are giving to the Navajo and Hopi nations. Our word for their selfless act is ‘iyyikowa’ – it means serving those in need.”The Choctaw and Irish had become kindred spirits since the potato famine, the tribe said. “We hope the Irish, Navajo and Hopi peoples develop lasting friendships, as we have. Sharing our cultures makes the world grow smaller.”The donations will help supply food, water and medical supplies for vulnerable families, many of whom have diabetes and other diseases.The Navajo nation has the highest per-capita Covid-19 infection rate after New York and New Jersey. Its rural territory stretches 27,000 sq miles across Arizona, New Mexico and Utah and surrounds the Hopi reservation.As of Thursday there were 2,757 confirmed cases. The official death toll was 88 but actual fatalities are likely to be much higher because the sickest patients are transferred to state hospitals.The virus has spread rapidly even though the tribal government was among the first to issue a stay-at-home order, lock down schools and business. On Wednesday the Nation received its portion, around $600m, of federal coronavirus relief funding, six weeks after it was promised and only after suing the federal government over who was eligible for the money.The GoFundMe appeal’s original goal of $2m was increased after Irish people discovered the appeal via social media and swiftly swelled donations from the US and elsewhere.Ireland has never forgotten the Choctaws’ generosity. The tribe had endured a forced 600-mile trek that left thousands dead from hunger, cold and disease, and then impoverishment in Oklahoma, yet somehow rustled up $170 – which today translates to $5,350 – to help the Irish.About 1 million Irish people died of hunger or disease from 1845 to 1849, and another million emigrated.In 1995 Mary Robinson, Ireland’s then president, visited Oklahoma to thank the Choctaws, a pilgrimage repeated by Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, in 2018.An outdoor sculpture titled the Kindred Spirits in Midleton, county Cork, commemorates the link between Ireland and Native Americans.

Manufacturers’ warehouses considered low risk for the virus could reopen as well.The new guidelines were announced by the California governor, Gavin Newsom, and move the state into the second phase of a methodical four-step process to full reopening. They also allow some local governments to move faster with reopening than the state overall if the counties meet certain testing and tracing requirements and have a healthcare system that can handle a potential surge.“We continue to want to remind you and need to remind you of the incredible importance of vigilance at this moment,” he said. “This pandemic has not gone away. We may be exhausted by it, we may be chomping at the bit to get back to some semblance of normalcy, but we had 1,898 new positive cases yesterday. We had 81 families torn apart because of the loss of a loved one.”Newsom said the state government wants to work with local counties who could open up sooner. “Not every part of the state will move at the same time,” he acknowledged.The governor also announced California would send every registered voter a mail-in ballot in the upcoming November elections. Newsom signed an executive order Friday that he hopes will give voters a choice and make sure they “don’t feel like they have to go into a concentrated, dense environment where they feel like their health is at risk”.“There’s no safer, physically distancing way to exercise your right to vote than from the safety and convenience of your own home,” said California secretary of state Alex Padilla. Voters will still have the option to vote in person, he added.In many cities, this week’s changes did not lead to immediate dramatic changes. Several local governments have announced they will take more time to open up, and many smaller retail stores have already organized curbside pickup. In the Los Angeles region, where half of the state’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred, officials are maintaining most restrictions and making only “minor adjustments”, allowing some brick-and-mortar business to start curbside pickup, including music stores, bookshops, florists and clothing stores.The county, which remains the primary coronavirus hotspot in California, was also reopening some popular hiking trails and golf courses, but have said residents must continue to practice social distancing and wear face coverings if near others. This first phase, LA officials said, is the beginning of “a slow and gradual change to a new reality” for Angelenos.The beaches in Orange county, which Newsom shut down after they drew massive crowds last month, are also reopening, but officials are keeping many parking lots closed and only allowing “active recreation” like running and swimming while banning sunbathing and stationary hangouts.The city of San Francisco said it, too, will allow some businesses to open with curbside pickup, but was delaying that move until 18 May. Like LA, bookstores, florists and music stores will be the first merchants allowed to operate storefront pickup, the city said.“Giving businesses the option to reopen and provide storefront pickup will provide some relief for everyone in our city – allowing some people to get back to work, while still protecting public health,” the mayor, London Breed, said in a statement. “The last thing we want is to see a spike in the number of cases or hospitalizations, so we’re going to be keeping close track of our key Covid-19 indicators and will be ready to make any adjustment needed to keep our community healthy.”Streets and sidewalks in Oakland’s Chinatown appeared reanimated on Friday morning, with more traffic than they’ve seen since mid-March.Many grocery store workers wore full face shields, as shoppers sifted through produce displayed outside the markets. “Today’s been the busiest, that’s the only difference,” said a stockperson at Aloha Market. “It’s mostly grocery stores and restaurants around here, so not a lot has changed – just more people”.On the eve of Mother’s Day weekend, business appeared to be buzzing at From Heart Florist. Staff made fast work out of flower arrangements, prepping bouquets for pickup orders and delivery.Some rural counties in northern California didn’t await the governor’s decision. Modoc county was the first last week to allow its only movie theater to resume operations. Yuba and Sutter counties started opening up businesses such as retail stores, gyms, salons and tattoo parlors on Monday, prompting a warning from the governor they were making “a big mistake”.In Yuba City and Marysville on Tuesday, few customers wore masks when they entered stores or strolled along the sidewalks. The counties’ public health commissioner warned the business communities the next day to make sure employees and customers adhere to social distancing guidelines and wear face coverings. “It has become clear a number of businesses are not enacting required protocols to ensure the safety of the community,” Dr Phuong Luu said.State regulators have begun contacting businesses opening early, but are focusing less on penalizing them and more on gaining voluntary compliance. Thirty-three salons in two counties that had reopened in defiance of the statewide order have now shut down again, Newsom said. “They’re now working with us in the spirit of collaboration and cooperation,” he said.Businesses across California, America’s most populous state, are eager to follow suit. Since the stay-at-home order was issued on 19 March, more than 4 million Californians have been put out of work. Newsom projected on Thursday the state will have a budget shortfall of $54.3bn because of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus.Small groups of protesters have gathered in cities across the state in recent weeks, urging Newsom to open up.Public health officials have cautioned, however, that the state has not seen a sustained decline in Covid-19 cases, and that its capabilities to test people and trace who might have been exposed to the virus are nowhere near those of countries like South Korea and Germany that have successfully eased restrictions.By Thursday, California had recorded more than 61,000 confirmed cases and 2,500 deaths. If the numbers continue to decline, the next phase in the governor’s plan could see salons, gyms, movie theaters and in-person church services resume. That phase, however, could be months away. Phase four would end all restrictions and allow for large gatherings at concerts and sporting events.Jefferson Wagner, owner of Zuma Jay surf shop along the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, put up a sign that said “no mask, no service” as he prepared to reopen on Friday, allowing customers to order in advance and pick up surfboards, apparel or other items in the parking lot. “We’ve got full inventory. We’re well stocked after two months of doing nothing,” said Wagner, 66, who is also a longtime Hollywood special effects operator. “We’ve gotta get these businesses open … though in LA and Malibu, we’re not the kind to run around and carry banners and firearms to protest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c7c92765ad431289c6051cf203b855935a9e654/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29e346a1ee5b06c67247bf0f3e55ad5","title":"commemorating ve day during coronavirus lockdown somehow the quiet made it louder","story":"With coronavirus lockdown subduing VE Day, contrasts with 75 years ago were many and variedSomehow the quiet made it louder. By rights, marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day in the midst of a pandemic that has confined us to our homes – forcing us to keep our distance from one another, denying us the right to gather in crowds – should have muffled this commemoration. A celebration in private would surely feel like no celebration at all. Katherine Jenkins singing to an empty Albert Hall, streets with no street parties and the pubs all shut: how could that add up to anything other than a damp squib?And yet Friday’s marking of the end of the second world war struck a deeper chord than it might, had it been just another sunny bank holiday. Yes, the usual rituals had to be suspended. There could be no wreath-laying at local memorials instead, Prince Charles and Camilla laid two small wreaths on their own, in a crowdless corner of Balmoral, watched by a lone piper. There could be no veterans’ parades, no reunions for those who had served, no grateful handshakes from the politicians: 102-year-old former staff sergeant Ernie Horsfall had to make do with a Zoom call from Boris Johnson. And there were limited opportunities for silliness: the Winston Churchill impersonators were all dressed up with nowhere to go, forced to perform their cigar-and-V-sign shtick online.All the same, Britons seemed more conscious of this 75th anniversary than previous ones. Manufacturers of bunting and flags reported record sales, busier than for any previous VE Day commemoration, busier even than in the summer of 2012 when the London Olympics and Queen’s diamond jubilee coincided.Perhaps it’s no surprise that Britons in the grip of the coronavirus pandemic should seize on the memory of the allies’ victory in Europe. After all, the second world war has hovered over this crisis from the start. The instant lockdown was declared, headline writers and politicians alike invoked the Blitz spirit, implicitly urging us to keep calm and carry on. In those early days, fear of a return to the wartime ration book sent many to the supermarkets to stock up, even to wrestle with each other for rolls of toilet paper. As Churchill’s grandson, the former MP Nicholas Soames, reflected in a BBC interview on Thursday, seven decades ago people had had to get by on one egg a week, but “these days there’s practically a riot if you can’t get strawberries in November”.But the last war is the lens through which we see ourselves even in good times – a decent run in the World Cup has us dusting off the parallels – so it’s hardly a shock that we do the same when facing a menace that has killed tens of thousands in a matter of weeks. That association has been certified from the top. The Queen made the connection in the TV address she delivered last month, when she channelled Vera Lynn to promise the country that “we will meet again”, and VE Day was bound to be no different.In a broadcast timed for the exact hour – 9pm – when George VI addressed the nation on 8 May 1945, his daughter offered a message of encouragement loud with wartime echoes. “Never give up, never despair,” she said, phrases with a distinctly Churchillian cadence. And then, as she had in April, she reassured Britons that they were every bit as strong as their forebears: “We are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”The link between Covid-19 and the war has found a human face besides that of the monarch and it was on display again on Friday. It’s not a coincidence that Captain Tom Moore has been the anointed talisman of this crisis, raising north of £31m by walking 100 times around his garden to mark his 100th birthday. Moore – now elevated to the status of both honorary colonel and national treasure – embodies the notion that there is a continuity of British resilience, that the same collective backbone that enabled us to see off Hitler will allow us to “send coronavirus packing”, as Johnson put it before he himself was struck down. It was all but ordained that the hero of this hour would be a second world war veteran. Only someone who had contributed to our finest hour could steel us for one of our darkest.Even so, coronavirus and the war that ended 75 years ago make an odd fit. For one thing, war and disease are not the same. Covid-19 reduces no buildings to rubble it drops no bombs from the sky. It will not send a general and an admiral, in dress uniforms, to sign an unconditional surrender. There will be no moment when, at the stroke of midnight, we can declare that the war is over.And even if there were, we know that we are nowhere near it. Those who listened to the BBC’s rebroadcast of Churchill’s 3pm victory speech, granting Britons a “brief period of rejoicing”, knew that the two stories were out of sync. Joan Bakewell recalled on this site her childhood memories of VE Day, the day “the great deadly cloud of threat lifted”. But that deadly cloud still looms over a country whose official death toll from the virus is now the highest in Europe, above 30,000 and rising.For a moment, and by a benign quirk of timing, it seemed as if the anniversary might coincide with a measure of relief. “Happy Monday,” promised Thursday’s Sun on its front page, suggesting the government was poised to ease the lockdown, in line with its decision to ditch the slogan – with its wartime ring – “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”. That now seems to have been another bit of bungled comms by a government that is making a habit of them. Even if it’s not true that social distancing will endure into 2021, or that a vaccine could take several years to develop, plenty of Britons will feel that, when it comes to the war against the coronavirus, we are rather closer to 3 September 1939 than we are to 8 May 1945.There is another difference, one that can feel like bad form to mention. Britain may have stood alone for a valiant year of the war, but it did not end it that way. Victory in Europe was a victory of an alliance, won at a high cost in British, Commonwealth, American and especially Russian blood. Not for nothing did Churchill’s VE day speech spill over with “gratitude to our splendid allies”.But there is no such alliance, and all too little global cooperation, in the war against the virus. At the desk where Franklin D Roosevelt once sat now lurks Donald J Trump, who first denied that a threat existed at all and whose energies since have been devoted not to leading a worldwide effort to defeat it – a task for which the United States is uniquely equipped – but to finding someone to blame for the fatal havoc it is wreaking (usually Democratic state governors, the media, China or all three). Trump shows nothing but contempt for the global institutions created after 1945, designed to ensure that the peoples of the world would face future perils together – institutions that are now creaking under the strain.Britain stands especially alone. Not long after VE Day, Churchill was pressing the case for what needed to happen next. “We must recreate the European family in a regional structure called, it may be, the United States of Europe,” Churchill declared in Zurich in 1946. Five years later, he was warning of the “disadvantages and even dangers to us in standing aloof” from a more united Europe. He was sad that Britain had refused to discuss the creation of a European army. He hoped Britain would join the European Coal and Steel Community, the precursor of the Common Market. Close ties to our European neighbours were precious, Churchill argued, even if that sometimes meant “the abrogation of national sovereignty”.Seventy-five years on, those who most like to invoke the name of our wartime leader choose to pretend he never did or said those things. In today’s Downing Street there’s a Churchill tribute act who led the campaign to wrench Britain away from its allies in the European Union, who has made Brexit into a defining credo and who has presided over a government that passed up three chances to protect its doctors and nurses from a deadly virus, lest joining an EU procurement scheme be seen as engaging in treacherous European cooperation.So, yes, it was natural for Britons to bask in the May sunshine and remember a brighter moment, to take comfort from it and draw strength from its lesson: that even the darkest hours end eventually. It made sense to come together and raise a glass for the day when we will meet again. But we are fighting a different war now, against an invisible enemy, and led by lesser men."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d584a698b4d25fcd2c2157c506f482fd1dd3079/0_358_5100_3061/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96b3b3feb8e55ea90ed57e6985370665","title":"how are you marking the 75th anniversary of ve day in lockdown","story":"We’d like to hear from people about how you’re remembering the anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe Friday 8 May will mark 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe.

Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.“But our streets are not empty: they are filled with the love and care that we have for each other. And, when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”The country united during a two-minute silence at 11am as people stood, heads bowed at front doors in bunting-lined streets, and wreaths were laid at war memorials in small, physically-distanced ceremonies.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall led the national moment of remembrance, paying their respects in Scotland at the Balmoral war memorial , placing a wreath and bouquet of spring flowers from their garden at nearby Birkhall as a lone piper played. A cannon at Edinburgh castle started and ended the silence, as a Spitfire flypast soared over the iconic white cliffs of Dover.Earlier, the Red Arrows streamed red, white and blue as they roared over central London, passing above The Mall, now deserted but which was to have been packed with thousands ahead of a veterans parade and the scene of joyful reunions with old comrades. RAF Typhoon jets performed flypasts over Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast.Extracts from Churchill’s historic victory speech were broadcast, followed by the “Nation’s Toast”: “To those who gave so much, we thank you.” Royal Navy warships and support vessels blasted their sirens to mark the occasion. Messages such as We Will Meet Again and Thank You were etched in the sky above Henstridge airfield in Somerset.With original elaborate plans hastily rearranged because of Covid-19, the wartime generation who Boris Johnson said had “carried the fate of freedom on their shoulders” were confined to their homes. Crowded street parties, one of the defining images of VE Day, are banned.But even strict social distancing measures could not mute the mood of celebration, as households across the country evoked the spirit of the 1940s, some dressing in period costume and hosting household tea parties. Where possible, care homes organised singalongs and festivities for residents. One second world war veteran, Eric Bradshaw, 95, isolated in his Oldham care home owing to Covid-19, was surprised by a special salute by Royal British Legion members and RAF cadets.It may not have been the day planned, but VE Day 75 will itself become a part of history.Speaking at the same hour her father, George VI, delivered his historic broadcast on a “great deliverance” 75 years ago, the Queen paid tribute to the many who “laid down their lives in that terrible conflict” and died “so we could live as free people in a world of free nations”.“We should and will remember them,” she said.In the broadcast, pre-recorded at Windsor castle, she recalled a VE Day which “some of us experienced first hand”. The Queen was a member of the Auxiliary Territorial Services (ATS) and the khaki cap she wore was placed on her desk. With a photograph of her father also prominently displayed, and wearing the Boucheron aquamarine and diamond clip brooches he gave her for her 18th birthday, she said: “I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.” The “sense of joy” in the crowds was “profound” she said.The greatest tribute to all those who did not come back from the war “was to ensure it didn’t happen again,” she said. Once sworn enemies were now friends “working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all”.The prime minister, Boris Johnson, observed the silence in Downing Street, having earlier written to veterans stressing that “our gratitude will be eternal”.“On this anniversary, we are engaged in a new struggle against the coronavirus, which demands the same spirit of national endeavour that you exemplified 75 years ago,” he wrote. “We cannot pay our tribute with the parades and street celebrations we enjoyed in the past your loved ones may be unable to visit in person.“But please allow us, your proud compatriots, to be the first to offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.”He also spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to mark the anniversary. “They paid tribute to the collaboration between British and Russian forces during the second world war, including through the Arctic convoys, and to the heroism and sacrifice of all those who lost their lives,” a Downing Street spokesman said.Dramatically scaled-back events included a BBC programme of celebration, featuring stars including the Welsh soprano Katherine Jenkins, and broadcast from the quadrangle at Buckingham Palace, which itself emerged bomb-scarred from the blitz.The Queen’s address was immediately followed by a nationwide rendition of the wartime classic We’ll Meet Again, with Dame Vera Lynn, 103, joining from her home in East Sussex, and the public singing from their doorsteps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19d820573af38f1c17f49712a26f8a370b450d69/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00b9343cf66b535300b85363aea2923f","title":"plan to open schools on 1 june in doubt as unions say safety in doubt","story":"Joint statement insists return will not happen until stringent ‘test and trace’ regime in placeMinisters’ plans to reopen schools as early as 1 June are in serious doubt after unions representing teachers and school staff insisted that they would not consider a return without a stringent coronavirus “test and trace” regime.In an unusual joint statement, which one senior union official said indicated that an early return to a normal school timetable was “off the menu”, the Trades Union Congress said that there should be “no increase in pupil numbers until full rollout of a national test and trace scheme”, and called for the establishment of a Covid-19 taskforce with government, unions and others to agree on the safe reopening of schools.But with a national strategy for a scheme that would help identify who needs to be in quarantine yet to be deployed – and a contact-tracing phone app still undergoing a limited trial on the Isle of Wight – the unions’ tests are unlikely to be satisfied by the 1 June date floated by officials last week.That could mean children in England and Wales returning to schools for just a few weeks between now and the new school year in September, and pupils in Scotland – who break up earlier – increasingly unlikely to return before the summer holidays at all.The Scottish and Welsh governments have already announced that their schools will not reopen on 1 June.The news comes amid growing signs that Boris Johnson will set out a cautious “roadmap” for the next phase of the crisis on Sunday after the government faced severe criticism over its mixed messages about what the public should expect.The statement, submitted to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is backed by the main teaching unions, as well as Unite, GMB and Unison, which represent key school staff such as cleaners, administrators and caterers. Any return without their agreement is highly unlikely.“The wider reopening of our schools will depend greatly on ensuring that families and carers are fully confident that allowing their children to return to school is safe. We do not believe that sufficient levels of confidence exist at this time,” it said.Johnson told last weekend’s Sun on Sunday: “One of the things we want to do as fast as we can is get primary schools back. It’s not going to be easy, but that’s where we want to go. It’s about working out a way to do it.”Whitehall sources suggested at the time he had in mind a phased return from the beginning of June, after the summer half-term break.But the  understands that conversations with headteachers and trade unions in recent days have underlined the practical challenges of the move – and the potential resistance from parents anxious about their children’s safety. A government source insisted on Friday: “We never set a date.”Ahead of Johnson’s address to the nation, the environment secretary, George Eustice, on Friday played down suggestions of any major changes to the lockdown regime, stressing that the government would proceed “with the utmost caution”.At the press briefing, Eustice also stressed the importance of abiding by the existing measures over the bank holiday weekend, despite the fact that the government is poised to allow unlimited exercise, sunbathing and picnics from Monday.But he welcomed moves by some businesses to reopen where existing restrictions already allow – including McDonald’s. “Our view is that McDonald’s drive-through is made for the social distancing system that we are in,” he said.The Welsh government stole a march on Johnson on Friday by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, insisted that the lockdown needed to stay, but said “very cautious” changes would come into force. He anticipated that “broadly” similar changes would be announced by the prime minister.He said that from Monday, people would be allowed to exercise more than once a day, provided that they do not travel “a significant distance” from their home. Garden centres will be allowed to reopen if they can ensure that the 2-metre physical distancing rule is enforced. And councils will begin work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.The announcement came as Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she believed “all four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages”, although she expected ergence from England’s upcoming new guidance to be minor.The TUC’s tests include “clear scientific published evidence” that reopening schools will not increase the transmission of Covid-19 agreement between government, unions and employers over minimum safety standards for social distancing and hygiene and a ”secure supply” of PPE for school staff.But the key demand is that opening up schools cannot begin until there is a “full rollout” of the government’s test, trace and isolate policy, with targets for testing being consistently met and the numbers of new cases of Covid-19 falling.Williamson has maintained that his top priority is the safety of children, and said that the question of when and how to reopen schools is the government’s most difficult decision.The teaching unions and the Department for Education have been consulting closely in recent days, with ministers and advisers contacting inidual headteachers and academy leaders to canvass their views. Following the discussions, the DfE believes the TUC’s tests do not differ significantly from those set out by the government to end the lockdown.Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at University College London who has been involved in the development of coronavirus tracing apps in countries including Switzerland and Germany, said it was possible that the first NHS tracing app could be ready by 1 June. But he warned that an app alone would be unlikely to be sufficient to curb a Covid-19 outbreak affecting schools.“The question is, would an app help schools?” he said. “Primary schools don’t contain humans with smartphones in the same way as the rest of the world. Certainly, unions should be alert to health risks for the workers they represent, but I don’t think unions should rely on an app to protect their workers. They should make demands that relate to broader tracking and tracing capabilities.”Veale said that an underlying problem in the UK was its failure to conduct enough tests to make tracing work effectively, even with a functioning app available. The first version of the NHS app requires users to self-report symptoms.“We must be careful not to make strong claims about the effectiveness of an app before we have even deployed one,” he said.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has claimed that a nationwide contact-tracing scheme, involving 18,000 contact tracers, will be in place by mid-May. But he has conceded that it is a “huge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity”.The NASUWT teaching union has already called for schools to remain closed until the end of the summer holidays, while the National Association of Head Teachers said it is “clear that parents are very nervous about sending their children back to school”.A DfE spokesperson said: “Schools will remain closed, except for children of critical workers and vulnerable children, until the scientific advice indicates it is the right time to re-open and the five tests set out by government to beat this virus have been met.“We are also working closely with the sector as we consider how to reopen schools, nurseries and colleges and will ensure everyone has sufficient notice to plan and prepare.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e73647ca8441507e18b6ece639373fc9a9d3e850/0_150_4489_2694/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ed1e593759b1f95c9845ed08e3af3af","title":"wales to remain in lockdown for at least three more weeks coronavirus","story":"First minister also announces ‘very cautious’ changes to measure to tackle coronavirusThe Welsh government has stolen a march on Boris Johnson by announcing a three-week extension to its coronavirus lockdown and making modest adjustments, including allowing outdoor exercise more than once a day and plans to reopen libraries.The first minister, Mark Drakeford, insisted the lockdown needed to stay but said “very cautious” changes would come into force. He anticipated that “broadly” similar changes would be announced by the prime minister.Drakeford emphasised that he remained keen on the four nations of the UK working as one over the lifting of restrictions and said the new rules would come into force on Monday so Wales moved in step with the rest of the UK.Asked if he was happy with how the UK government was working with his administration, he said: “It has been a bit of a fits-and-starts experience.”The announcement came as Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said that she believed “all four nations now accept there may be differences in pace of how we do these things because the level of the virus is at different stages”, although she expected variation with England’s upcoming new guidance to be minor.She plans to confirm over the weekend whether to allow more daily exercise, but said garden centres will remain closed for the time being and emphasised the “stay at home” message. Sturgeon said the rate of transmission of the coronavirus – the so-called ‘R’ number – is currently between 0.7 and 1 in Scotland, but closer to 1 than 0.7.R, or the \u0027effective reproduction number\u0027, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus people\u0027s behaviour, such as social distancing\u0026nbspand a population’s immunity.\u0026nbspDrakeford said the ‘R’ number was believed to be 0.8 in Wales. He said if this figure remained constant, it was estimated there would be about 800 more deaths between now and August. If it went up to 1.1, there could be 7,200 deaths.Speaking at the Welsh government’s press conference in Cardiff on Friday, he said: “We must not lose the progress we have made. All of us must continue to work from home whenever we can. All of us must only travel when absolutely necessary. All of us must continue to observe the 2-metre social distancing, and wash our hands and take those basic hygiene precautions. The margins are so small.”But he said that from Monday, people will be allowed to exercise more than once a day, while not travelling “a significant distance” from home.Garden centres will be allowed to reopen, provided they can ensure the 2-metre physical distancing rule is followed. And councils will begin to work on plans to safely reopen libraries and municipal recycling centres.Drakeford’s intervention came 48 hours before the prime minister is due to announce possible changes to the rules in England. The first minister was also due to address the Welsh nation at 5.55pm on Friday.Despite signs of tension between Wales and Westminster, Drakeford said he wanted to “move in step with the other nations of the United Kingdom”.Asked if he was attempting to restrain Johnson by announcing the modest changes, he said: “It’s not an attempt to place restraints on anybody else. I spoke with the prime minister yesterday. The prime minister emphasised his wish to move in the most careful and cautious way.“While it will be for the prime minister to decide the steps that will be taken in England in adjusting regulations, I don’t believe you will see anywhere in the UK anything other than the most modest of immediate changes broadly of the sort that I have proposed making in Wales.”On his relationship with the UK government, Drakeford said: “When we have discussions with UK ministers they work well. They are open and engaged. What I’ve tried to argue for is a more reliable pattern of that engagement. We tend to get it, it doesn’t happen for a while, then it resumes again.“When we have it, it is good. It would be better from my point of view if it had a regular reliable pattern so we could maximise the desire of all four governments across the UK to work closer together. The more we talk the more we understand each other.”Drakeford denied the changes he announced risked sending out mixed messages. “For most people in Wales, staying at home remains the right thing to do,” he said.He called on people not to travel to beaches or beauty spots over the bank holiday weekend. “I want to make it very clear Wales remains in lockdown. Nothing has changed. A journey to the beach or mountains is not essential travel. The police are ready and will stop people. People will be sent home.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241807.1588238327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"does it matter whether my plants listen to mozart or bach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwinging back the polytunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. Illustration: Michael VineyMy painting below shows the polytunnel, with attendant gardener, in another good summer years ago. I’m still down there soon after breakfast, carrying the radio for Lyric, to tend a rather less ambitious vegetable array.As always, swinging back the tunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. On further inspection, I may murmur some encouragement to a row of climbing beans, praise the mangetout vines for their first purple flowers and the Russian tomatoes for their yellow ones.The streak of animism that tempers my appetite for science allows an amiable connection with plants I have raised from seeds. This lent some fellow feeling with Prince Charles when, years ago, he confided that he always talked to plants in his greenhouses, adding that it was “very important – they respond”.His incautious remarks came in the wake of an American book, The Secret Life of Plants (1973), which offered “the physical, emotional and spiritual relations between plants and man”. Mixing legitimate science on plant senses and behaviour with subjective experiment and spiritual folklore, it achieved a heady readability that earned much media praise and a considerable nod from public culture.Scientists seeking acceptance of the new view of plants met much sceptical reaction that jeopardised funding for their work. With the book’s authors now dead (neither of them were scientists), the popular case for plant senses and intelligence now has impeccable champions.From Israel, for example, plant geneticist Daniel Chamovitz offered What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses of Your Garden and Beyond (2012), of which a generous list is online as a PDF. It persuaded me that whether Lyric plays Mozart or Bach to my polytunnel plants, they are probably deaf to either. Even talking to them just offers a fleeting, if benevolent, breath of CO2.At Chamovitz’s Tel Aviv University, on the other hand, new experiments described by Itzhak Keit show that tomato and tobacco plants stressed by drought or being cut emit ultrasonic airborne sounds detectable several metres away. If the pinching out of shoots from the oxters of my tomatoes elicits squeals of protest, I am mercifully unable to hear them.Plant intelligence rests in the demonstrable awareness and responses by which they solve their problems. Rooted they may be, but hardly static, as the many online time-lapse films of growth – the ballet of seedling beans, the thrust of elongating briars – make enchantingly clear.If they show no special taste in music, they may indeed recoil from its vibrations. They hear approaching insects and react to the munching of caterpillars by flooding leaves with deterrent chemicals. They smell such signals of alarm released by their neighbours.This is now established in plant science, much of it easily accessible online. It readily bows to the early work of Charles Darwin among the pots of plants in his study: runner beans, cucumbers, nasturtiums, hops anything that climbed and moved.Darwin worked with son Francis to study the cellular search-and-curl movement (they called it “circumnutation”) of climbers twirling up poles. As Francis told a science assembly in Dublin: “We must believe that in plants there exists a faint copy of what we know as consciousness in ourselves.” This has developed into today’s “plant neurobiology”, a term disparaged by those scientists who save anything “neuro” for the human brain and its neurons.It was the Darwins, in their book The Power of Movement in Plants, who proposed that the tiny tip of the embryo root, first to emerge from the seed, “acts like the brain of one of the lower animals”. Its sensitivity, multiplied at the tips of branching roots, serves as a network of perception and command that guides their navigation through the soil.Richard Karban in the US and Anthony Trewavas in Scotland are two more of today’s notable scientists absorbed with plant intelligence. But the most vigorous and prolific proponent of the “root-brain hypothesis” is Italy’s Prof Stefano Mancuso at Florence University. Of his lectures on YouTube, “The roots of plant intelligence” in the Ted series is a specially engaging.Along with scientific enlightenment comes Mancuso’s challenge to human habits in viewing the life of the planet. Some 99 per cent of Earth’s biomass, as he argues, is that of plants, yet humans have ignored their intricate networks of consciousness, granting active intelligence only to an animal brain.In a corner of the polytunnel, a chair is propped in a bank of fading wallflowers, next to the early potatoes. I rest there, circled by bumblebees, to ponder such reproaches to human history. Our tight co-evolution and reliance on plants, Mancuso observed recently, “might raise the question of who actually domesticated whom”."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Laura HuttonGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan’s choice of Catherine Martin to lead the party’s negotiating team in Government formation talks has led to comparisons with Éamon de Valera choosing Michael Collins to lead Treaty negotiations.No death warrants or anything dramatic like that, but some see it as presaging a damaging split in a party which prides itself on a karmic approach to politics.The Dublin Rathdown TD and deputy leader has emerged as the leading figure of a minority in the parliamentary party who have been uneasy about an alliance with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.She is a surprising figurehead. She is not a left-wing firebrand like Saoirse McHugh or Cork councillor Lorna Bogue. She is centre-left at most, and would be seen as a natural collaborator who has forged good relations across all parties. She founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas and also pressed for anti-bullying protocols and structures in the Leinster House campus.Those close to her say she is not opposed per se to coalition, but wanted cast-iron guarantees way beyond those Ryan was prepared to accept.Her stance is said to have strained the previously close working relationship between them.Taught musicFrom Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan, Martin trained as a classical singer and performed nationally when younger. After graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.She had briefly flirted with politics. Her brother Vincent P Martin (now a senior counsel and Green councillor in Kildare) was an Independent councillor in Monaghan in the 1990s. She was co-opted to his seat for a while but then left politics. She and her husband, architect Francis Noel Duffy (now also a Green TD) decided to become involved in the Greens after starting a family a decade ago.Martin was elected a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016. She did it with an unstinting “boots on the ground” effort, canvassing every home numerous times. As the party’s second TD, it took a long while for her to emerge from the shadow of the high-profile Ryan. She is cautious by nature. “Every decision is thoroughly researched and she seeks advice widely. She does not say things lightly,” says a former colleague.Initially, she focused on strong suits such as education and Irish, but as time went on began to front on more issues.Some in the party find it hard to gauge where she stands. “I am never really sure what her politics are,” says one colleague. “At the moment she seems to be aligning herself with the young Greens and the Saoirse McHugh end.”‘Big stand’A supporter says, “This was a big stand for her. She could have sat on the fence. These are two parties who would buy and sell you in a second.”Her ferocious denunciation of Simon Coveney on RTÉ last week would have bolstered her standing with the doubters. It also showed her objections ran beyond climate change to a wider left-wing agenda.In the end, she was in a minority of three out of 12 TDs, along with her husband, Duffy and Neasa Hourigan (Patrick Costello abstained). Her appointment was a no-brainer. Given the deputy leaders from the two other parties are lead negotiators, if Ryan had not chosen her, it would have spelled “serious split”. She has said strongly she accepts the decision and will negotiate in good faith.Is there a bigger game at play? The party’s leadership must be decided within six months of the election. The party’s membership profile is younger and more radical. Some in the parliamentary party believe she has ambitions to be leader.“I would not be surprised if she runs,” says a supporter. “Eamon Ryan has had a long stint. He is bright and full of integrity but is he right strategically?”But is she? Time will tell.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4248832.1588974337!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"climate change is the central focus in fg ff and greens talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar and Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin wrote to the Social Democrats this week inviting the party to enter government-formation talks.

They held preliminary talks in Leinster House on Thursday morning before the first full session involving teams from all three parties later that afternoon. Well-placed sources said that Friday’s meeting involving Mr Coveney, Mr Calleary and Ms Martin was around process and logistics, agreeing the nature and scope of the agenda. “They are essentially marking out the pitch before the talks begin in earnest next week,” said one source.Ms Martin was one of three Green Party TDs who voted against entering government-formation talks with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. However, she told The  last weekend she accepted the democratic outcome of the parliamentary party’s decision, and would lead her five-person negotiating team in good faith.

Ms Hourigan is also on the party’s negotiating team, along with Ossian Smyth (Dún Laoghaire), Roderic O’Gorman (Dublin West) and Marc Ó Cathasaigh (Waterford). The issue around achieving an average annual 7 per cent reduction in climate change emissions has become a central focus of negotiations.

Both leaders committed to having “ring-fenced” funding for the health sector blueprint Sláintecare, but would not commit to a Social Democrats’ act of campaigning to end the EU’s fiscal rules regime. A spokeswoman for the Social Democrats said on Friday the party’s six TDs would be taking the weekend to consider its response to the letter.

Control answered that they had not and signed off the reply with a ‘QRX’ code, indicating the time they will speak on the next day.   Intercepted by the British, the Bletchley Park analyst commented on the signal: “He does not seem to have much opinion of the speed of our troops as he gives each outstation a QRX for tomorrow morning”. In fact the Tommies arrived at Cuxhaven at 14.00 on May 6, an hour and a half after Control said they’d not arrived yet.As the Allies closed in the radio network rapidly collapsed as stations went off the air.Realising he was probably alone and with his calls unanswered, the last German signaller still at his post, Lieutenant Kunkel, sent the final message of the war from the network wishing any listening colleagues good luck.Intercepted by Bletchley Park codebreakers, he signed off for the very last time at 07.35 on the morning of May 7, 1945, saying:“British troops entered Cuxhaven at 14.00 on 6 May – from now on all radio traffic will cease – wishing you all the best. Lt Kunkel” This was immediately followed by: “Closing down for ever – all the best – goodbye”A day later the war was over, but Bletchley Park codebreakers carried on working monitoring German communications to confirm that they were surrendering and that there would be no final stand by the Nazis.GCHQ\u0027s Historian Tony Comer said: “These transcripts give us a small insight into the real people behind the machinery of war. “While most of the UK was preparing to celebrate the war ending, and the last of the German military communicators surrendered, Bletchley staff – like today’s GCHQ workers – carried on working to help keep the country safe.”The document, graded Top Secret at the time due to the sensitivity around the work at Bletchley Park, was signed off in Hut 6 by Professor Frederick Norman, known as ‘Bimbo’ because of his child-like enthusiasm, quickness of wit and intellectual curiosity.Described by one of the women working at Bletchley Park as “quite a character” due to his habit of wearing a trilby hat and leggings, Professor Norman specialised in providing scientific intelligence to the Air Ministry’s Chief Scientist.According to Tony Comer, Frederick Norman learned German while a prisoner in the First World War and was recruited for Bletchley Park in September 1939 from his post as Professor of Medieval German at King’s College, London. In 1940 he became one of the original Watch staff in Hut 3, where Alan Turing occasionally worked, and had become Head of the Hut 3 Research Section by May 1942.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed emailed offer help turkish t shirt salesman led ppe","story":"It began with an emailed offer of help from a T-shirt salesman in Turkey who promised that he could help solve the UK\u0027s worsening personal protective equipment (PPE) crisis.Little more than three weeks later, a Royal Air Force plane was pictured waiting on the tarmac at an airport in Istanbul as ministers were accused of presiding over a farce.And finally – as The  revealed on Wednesday – the saga ended in catastrophe.

Around 170,000 more remain in Turkey after officials blocked their delivery over safety fears.Around 68,000 gowns provided directly by the Turkish government have passed safety tests, it is understood.On Thursday, senior MPs demanded an inquiry into how the mission – dubbed Air Jenrick – had gone so badly wrong.Downing Street said the UK Government would now seek a full refund or replacement, while hospital chiefs accused ministers of making critical deals on a wing and a prayer.NHS procurement chiefs, meanwhile, questioned why officials had pinned their hopes on a firm founded only four months ago with experience of making T-shirts and tracksuits rather than high-quality medical gear.The Istanbul-based company, Selegna Tekstil, first came to the attention of the UK Government in mid-March when Mehmet Duzen, a former parliamentary candidate turned textile salesman, saw an appeal for supplies and sent an email to the Department of Health.Mr Duzen had an affection for the UK, having lived in London in the mid-2000s.

But then, as supply chains in China dried up and hospitals began running out of vital protective gear, Mr Duzen received a grateful response.Back-and-forth discussions began over an order of 400,000 gowns, to be produced at the Selegna factory and flown back to the UK. NHS officials sent over complicated documents setting out UK standards in detail, including sleeve lengths and the type of non-woven material needed to repel virus-carrying fluid.At first glance, Selegna appears to have been an unlikely saviour. Documents show the company was only founded on January 31 to supply clothing including T-shirts and tracksuits. Its slogan was More Than Expected.As coronavirus began to spread around the world, Mr Duzen and his sister Naile, the firm\u0027s owner, decided to switch production to high-quality medical gear. One factory that previously made sweets was instructed to make masks instead.Mark Roscrow, the chairman of the Health Care Supply Association, which represents NHS procurement chiefs, said Selegna\u0027s lack of a track record should have raised the alarm.We should have done proper checks on the company, Mr Roscrow said. It should have raised obvious risks because the company didn\u0027t have much experience. Clearly we had some confidence in them, but that has apparently been a mistake. It\u0027s ended up with money being poured down the drain.On Thursday April 17, the deal was approved and the order placed. The next day, Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) officials paid a deposit, with the contract stating that the full balance would be paid on delivery.By that time, hospitals were at risk of running out of gowns completely. Only hours before, Public Health England (PHE) had sent out an unprecedented alert warning health workers to reuse their disposable gowns and, where possible, to wear aprons and laboratory coats instead.Ministers were under severe pressure to explain to the public where the next consignments of vital PPE were coming from, so the fateful decision was taken to tell the nation about the Turkey delivery at the Downing Street press conference led by Robert Jenrick, the Communities Secretary, on Saturday April 19.Today I can report that a very large consignment of PPE is due to arrive in the UK tomorrow from Turkey, which amounts to 84 tonnes of PPE and will include, for example, 400,000 gowns – so a very significant additional shipment, he said.According to one report, officials from the Department of Health warned Number 10 not to publicise the Turkey deal but were overruled.Behind the scenes, there was already a problem. A draconian weekend lockdown had just been enforced in Turkey. In Istanbul, Mr Duzen and his colleagues found their usual suppliers were unavailable, with factory workers forced to stay at home.Meanwhile, the firm had not yet formally secured an export license from the Turkish government, needed to sidestep a national export ban on PPE.If it was a normal order, I would have cancelled it because there was a misunderstanding and there was no time, Mr Duzen told the Financial Times last month. How could I supply the goods in one night? We didn\u0027t sleep. During frantic conference calls, UK officials tried to break down the obstacles in time to fulfil Mr Jenrick\u0027s promise.The following day, Gavin Williamson, the Education Secretary, admitted that the consignment was not yet ready, adding that he hoped it would arrive the next day.On Monday, as the Air Jenrick mission dominated news coverage, the decision was taken to send the Airbus A400-M plane to Turkey anyway in order to apply pressure.According to one senior Whitehall source, there was considerable disquiet among RAF chiefs as Government press officers sent out regular releases promising that the delivery would shortly arrive.The MOD was not part of this. The RAF was only there to help out, the source said. There were constant updates every time the plane moved an inch, and pictures in the newspapers. It looked ridiculous, frankly.The PPE order was still not ready, however. Eventually, the Turkish government stepped in to help UK ministers save face. It was arranged that a last-minute shipment of only 32,000 gowns made by Ushas, a state-backed firm, would be packed onto the plane, which finally left for RAF Brize Norton on the Monday afternoon. Exactly what happened next is unclear. According to sources, UK officials in Turkey did check the boxes of gowns supplied by Selegna to make sure they adhered to the agreed standards.After being given the go-ahead, RAF personnel dragged an initial consignment of around 67,000 gowns on to two more planes, which left for the UK later that week. But when they arrived, inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive discovered a major problem. Tests on around 2,400 of the gowns revealed that they would not, in fact, keep NHS workers safe from coronavirus.Around 4,500 more did pass the tests, but officials placed an immediate halt on further deliveries. The useless gowns were impounded in a facility near Heathrow, where they remain.Senior sources admitted on Thursday that a further 170,000 Selegna gowns were blocked by the UK after the alarm was raised, and are still in Turkey being checked by the Turkish Standards Institute.Hospital trusts which had been promised the vital gear were then informed that their deliveries had been cancelled.Asked on Thursday what had happened, Mr Duzen claimed he had not received any complaints from the NHS. The fabric we supplied was certified, he insisted. If there was a problem, they could do research and let us know.Sources at the Department of Health, however, said officials were in negotiations with Selegna to either supply safe PPE or hand back the deposit.There was a view that it was good enough PPE – it is only when it has got here that teams have looked at it again and taken a view that it is not up to the right standard and they\u0027ve decided not to use it,” said Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland Secretary, on Thursday.It is not known exactly how much the UK has already paid, but the total order is thought to be in the region of £300,000.Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the defence select committee, called for an investigation if errors have been committed. He said: I want this Government to succeed – but you need to demonstrate your success, not promise it and fail to deliver.Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents organisations across the healthcare sector, said: This illustrates the danger of making promises on a wing and a prayer. We have warned repeatedly that setting big targets which are then not met and saying all will be well, when at the sharp end of care it is manifestly not, undermines confidence among clinical staff on the front line.A spokesman for the Department of Health said on Thursday that ministers were grateful for the assistance of the Turkish government, adding: We have received part of an order of around 400,000 gowns from a private supplier in Turkey. While a small number of these gowns have failed tests in the UK, more have passed tests making them suitable for use in the NHS.We are working night and day to source PPE internationally and domestically, and more orders are lined up and expected from suppliers in the UK and overseas. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ve day 2020 celebrations pictures","story":"Queen Elizabeth II speaking to the nation to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day at the end of the Second World War Coronavirus latest news: Young men more likely to break lockdown rules, study showsUS Mother\u0026#39s Day 2020: how the campaign was won – and why the woman behind it turned against her workComment: Corrupt and secretive, China is doing its best to muzzle its brilliant scientists on Covid-19End of lockdown timetable: When shops, offices, and public transport will reopen Social distancing: What are the rules and how might they change?Boris Johnson\u0026#39s lockdown speech: When is it, what will he say, and how can I watch it?Revealed: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s roadmap to ease lockdown and reopen schools and shopsComment: Britain may be obsessed by board games, but ministers\u0026#39 endless missteps are far more ertingThe inside story of how The  caught the world\u0026#39s most-wanted billionaireComment: Extending the Brexit transition would be a terrible error if EU intransigence crashes the talksVE Day: Veteran defies coronavirus to stand alone at Cenotaph in touching tributeHard Brexit more likely because of coronavirus and lack of progress in talks, says German foreign ministerCoronavirus quarantine: All UK arrivals \u0026#39will have to self-isolate for 14 days\u0026#39 Boy, 5, in New York dies of rare disease linked to coronavirusComment: Coronavirus has turned us into a nation of scaredy-catsCoronavirus: Six-week-old baby among latest to die of Covid-19Face masks with fake safety marks seized as coronavirus scams riseDuke and Duchess of York forced to sell £13m Swiss ski chaletVE Day: I\u0026#39ve the luck of the Irish, says last survivor of The FewVE Day 2020: Britons celebrate 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe DayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain no longer exceptional lights ve day have dimmed time","story":"As the lights of VE Day celebrations dimmed and the bunting was taken down, international leaders turned their attention to building a new security order to prevent anything like the horrors of the Second World War happening again. The long and terrible struggle to defeat fascism had left millions dead, infrastructure smashed and a dangerous void in the global security apparatus.Commemorating the 75th anniversary of victory in Europe, Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute said this week: “The full meaning of any military victory is never clear at the time. It keeps changing with the benefit of hindsight”.Hosting a webinar examining how the current international security order was forged in the immediate post-war years, Professor Chalmers reflected on the deep strains it now faces and asked if the victory of VE Day has dimmed over the intervening years. The “changing and erratic nature of American leadership,” could potentially unravel the stable international order since the war, he said, adding he feared “the revival of nationalism, even at the heart of the Western security community”.Historian Anne Applebaum applauded the “bravery and insight” of post-war leaders for the security mechanisms they put in place. “The amazing generosity of Americans to decide to stay in Europe and effectively to fight a second conflict (the Cold War)…is really quite extraordinary,” she said.“You can imagine what voices there were against it…and yet they stayed to create this idea of the West based on common values.”She worried that “the isolationist strand of American political thinking” could sever these longstanding bonds. “The unity of values has got cracks in it,” she said. “We don’t all stand for the same things.”“Donald Trump is not somebody who has gone back and forth across the Atlantic with the goal of building friendships and alliances. He sometimes did it in order to build hotels but it’s really not the same thing.”Will the ideals behind the Transatlantic alliance go on being valued, she wondered.However, Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman of King’s College London questioned the primacy of links to America.“What happens in Asia shapes what happens in Europe now, we’re no longer so much in control of events as we were before. It’s hard to get used to.A generation of politicians that expects Washington, London, Berlin and Paris to be consulted first over international events has had to get used to Beijing, Tokyo and others now being in the conversation quite early, he suggested. Professor Freedman said a better case needed to be made for why Britain and America should remain so committed to the security apparatus of Europe, given this new world dynamic.Both speakers suggested the idea of British ‘exceptionalism’ unhelpfully endured and could even have stymied Britain’s response to the coronavirus crisis. Professor Freedman said the enormous effort of the Second World War had shaped the national psyche for generations to come.“At times like this (the fight against Covid-19) we go back to our most difficult period, which was 1940 when we were alone. “Our queen was broadcasting then and she’s broadcasting now. There is a sense of continuity in all of this. There were good things about that period – resilience and solidarity – so it’s not necessarily a bad memory. “Whether that collective resilience and solidarity can become part of the new order may be wishful thinking…in a way we’ve been lacking.”Ms Applebaum agreed: “The way the war story is told in Britain does continually emphasise the specialness and uniqueness of Britain. She suggested Westminster’s early response to the coronavirus pandemic was: “we’re exceptional, we’re not Italy, we’re going to deal with this differently, we’re not going to draw lessons from other countries, we’re going to do this our own way”.“That may have been a mistake,” she said. “It may have been one of the reasons why Britain had this chaotic descent into very high rates of infection very fast.”Observing the swift resort to lockdown and face masks in countries such as Slovakia, “a much smaller country than Britain and one that doesn’t have a sense of itself as being exceptional and special”, she said the British attitude was: “we can’t do that, we have a historic right to go to the pub, no British person will ever reject that and face masks are for foreigners.”“Had a slightly different attitude prevailed it’s possible Britain might have avoided some of what happened next,” she said. Professor Lawrence said he blamed the US Secretary of State at the start of the Cold War for the ongoing argument about Britain’s “role in the world stuff”.“It’s a real problem,” he said.“I blame Dean Acheson for this in 1962 when he accused Britain of having lost an empire but failing to find a role, as if there was an exceptional role for the UK and there isn’t.“The UK is a major power with a lot to contribute but there’s no one bit of the international system that suddenly falls apart if the British do one thing rather than another. “Part of the challenge at the moment is to get ourselves into perspective and not exaggerate what we can do, but there are contributions we can still make.”Referring to the fight against Covid-19 he said: “There are particular things at the moment that we have to get right and it is the case that the rhetoric of 1940 perhaps has an undue influence on our thinking.“The idea that we are particularly exceptional won’t last.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to

provide face coverings for staff who are required back at work, with Boris Johnson expected to recommend their use on Sunday night.Although face coverings will not be made compulsory for people in England, the Prime Minister is likely to suggest that they are worn at work, on public transport and while out shopping when he delivers his lockdown address at 7pm. The Cabinet Office has commissioned and paid for machines to make face coverings so that businesses can obtain them directly from the Government.The emphasis will be placed on non surgical coverings in order to protect the supply of higher grade face masks to the NHS, carers and other front line workers. Next week, the Department of Health will set out a range of options for face coverings, including what material they should be made of.One Government source said: What we do not want is people to go on to websites and try to order clinical stuff which takes away from the NHS supply.Currently, British advice is in line with that of the World Health Organisation and does not recommend mask wearing for the general public. But a Cabinet minister said that despite the lack of conclusive evidence a consensus was building that they won\u0027t do any harm.There is a theory that wearing masks might make people less vigilant, but this is about giving people confidence to return to work, the minister said. If it makes people feel safer using public transport then it is a good thing, so we are leaning towards it.Another Cabinet minister said: The onus will be on the employers to provide them.The move comes after Mr Johnson last week made an apparent off-the-cuff remark that wearing face coverings for returning staff to workplaces would give them confidence that they do not risk catching coronavirus.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference on April 30, he said: I do think that face coverings will be useful, both for epidemiological reasons, but also for giving people confidence that they can go back to work.Mr Johnson\u0027s announcement came a day after Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said that asking people to wear face masks to protect themselves from coronavirus could make them behave in a cavalier manner and risk spreading the virus.Confirming that the decision was under review, he told MPs on April 29: The scientific evidence so far is that face coverings can have an effect preventing an inidual spreading the disease to others if they have it and they are asymptomatic.The Scottish government has already recommended that people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces such as shops and public transport.Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, said there could be some benefit in wearing a cloth face covering in places where social distancing was difficult but insisted it was not a substitute for existing lockdown restrictions.The Government scientific advisory group Sage has submitted a report to ministers on the wearing of masks. Earlier this week, it emerged that scientists had told Sage cloth face masks for the public should be seen like seatbelts and cycling helmets in the battle against the pandemic.The evidence review, by a sub-group of the Royal Society, found that fabric coverings could be at least half as effective as surgical masks and suggested the public should be encouraged to wear them at work, on public transport and when shopping once the lockdown is eased.It also said the visibility of face coverings acted as a reminder of the need for physical distancing, increased handwashing, reduced face touching and group solidarity.Countries including Germany, the Czech Republic and the US have recommended the wearing of different forms of homemade masks from cloths, scarves and bandanas.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking

infection rate measure, senior MPs and scientists have warned.Ministers have been told the national reproductive \u0027R\u0027 value of coronavirus should not be regarded as the key to unlocking the UK because the figure has been skewed upwards by cases in hospitals and care homes.Meanwhile, officials refused to say when data revealing the true transmission rates in the community and different parts of the country would be made public.The average national \u0027R\u0027 value – the rate at which coronavirus is spreading – has become a daily feature of Downing Street press conferences, and is currently said to stand between 0.5 and 0.9.Ministers believe the figure is the most important of five tests that must be passed before the UK can begin to return to normal life. On Thursday, Boris Johnson said driving down the \u0027R\u0027 is the country\u0027s collective endeavour.But officials admitted this week that the national \u0027R\u0027 value had been pushed upwards in recent days by coronavirus spreading quickly in care homes rather than in the community.Greg Clark MP, the chairman of the science and technology select committee, urged ministers not to rely too heavily on the irrelevant figure while deciding whether people outside care homes could go back to work and see friends and family.There\u0027s a concern that measures that could safely release people back into the community are not being taken because of an irrelevant \u0027R\u0027 number determined by cases in care homes and hospitals, he told The .It\u0027s not clear how the \u0027R rate in care homes is relevant to the \u0027R\u0027 rates of people going about their daily business. If people are in a care home, by definition they are not going out into the community and infecting other people. But the single \u0027R\u0027 number given out by the Government has been skewed. It cannot reflect the reality outside, and we need to know whether crucial public policy decisions are being based on this number.Mr Clark urged the Government to release data showing the true rate of transmission in different parts of the UK so the regional risks, as well as the spread of disease in the community, can be fully understood.The Government should not be saying it is following the science without being totally transparent, he said.The R0 number, or reproductive value, describes the average number of people an infected inidual can expect to pass the coronavirus on to. If the figure is above one, that means the virus is continuing to spread rather than gradually dying away.A lack of mass testing has hampered the ability of scientists to assess the true spread of the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has said UK scientists calculating the \u0027R\u0027 rate are relying instead on all sorts of things including contacts, looking at genomics, looking at data from ambulances, hospital admissions, and so on.Five different modelling groups then fit mathematical models to the data before calculating the national \u0027R\u0027 rate. The groups, known as SPI-M, met last weekend and agreed on a consensus between their methods to come up with one single number.The figure was then presented to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, which advises the Government. On Thursday, Sir Ian Diamond, the National Statistician, said he agreed with new estimates that the national \u0027R\u0027 value  has risen to between 0.75 and 1.0 in recent weeks due to cases in care homes. But Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh and an adviser to Tony Blair\u0027s Government during the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001, said: The \u0027R\u0027 number ... is an average, so it glosses over differences between care homes, hospitals, the community and any other segment of the population as well.It is a very, very crude number, and I, personally, am very against using that number as a policy objective in any way.I would be unhappy if the Government had a policy of keeping the R number below one. Politicians grab hold of this number, and I understand why they do, but the interpretation of it is it\u0027s a very nuanced quantity and you have to dig a lot deeper.Asked at Friday\u0027s Downing Street press conference when the Government will share regional \u0027R\u0027 rate data, Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, said: I can\u0027t give you the data by region. It undoubtedly will vary from place to place, and it will vary over time from place to place. The important thing is that, as a whole, it stays below one to ensure that we don\u0027t risk a second peak and we don\u0027t risk putting pressure on our health service.It will vary across geographies, it will vary from time to time – but the important thing is to keep it below one.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"staycationers fuel socially distanced camping boom","story":"Britain is set for a camping boom this summer as staycationers looking for a socially distanced way to holiday fuel resort to planning to sleep under the stars.Holidaymakers still face uncertainty over AirBnB and hotel accommodation which may not be available until later in the season.Instead, those hoping that lockdown will be eased enough to travel within the UK by early summer are already making reservations for camping and caravanning trips in Britain\u0027s rural retreats.  Bookings for some campsites have reached levels expected before the virus took hold, according to sector experts.“Camping has been getting more and more popular over the last 10 years but it’s entirely possible that coming out of lockdown will increase that curve,” Jonathan Knight of Cool Camping said. “People seem to have been using this period for general reflection, doing things a slower way.  Camping definitely ticks those boxes.”  Nick Lomas, director general of the Caravan and Motorhome Club said: “The fundamental desire to get out in Britain’s great outdoors is as strong as it’s ever been.Our bookings for July onwards are almost identical to last year. We’ve also opened bookings all the way into 2021 and they’re very buoyant too.”  For those willing to risk a trip abroad, Ryanair has restarted flights to European city break locations in countries where lockdowns are easing.The airline said disinfected planes would fly three times a week from London Stansted to    Sofia and Bucharest from May 15th, and daily to Porto from May 22nd.  Ryanair’s Alejandra Ruiz said: “All the aircraft are disinfected daily and we ask all passengers to cooperate fully with our crews who are doing their best in difficult times.“We now hope there is a coordinated plan to lift travel restrictions when Europe is ready to return flying once COVID-19 is defeated, which will hopefully be sooner rather than later.”    More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ve day veteran defies coronavirus stand alone cenotaph touching","story":"One Second World War veteran refused to let a virus - even one as lethal as this coronavirus - stop him from marking the VE Day anniversary at the Cenotaph.Shortly before 11am, Royal Artillery veteran Lou Myers walked alone towards the memorial on Whitehall, his shoes polished and his grey trousers neatly-pressed.The 92-year-old wore his regimental tie and the Defence Medal, 1939-1945 War Medal and Korean War Medal pinned to his blazer. He stood near to Sir Edwin Lutyens\u0027 memorial to the Glorious Dead, which for 100 years has been the focal point of national commemorations.When the 11th hour struck, he bowed his head and held tightly on to his walking stick to observe the two-minute silence.Following this very private moment of reflection, he was applauded by strangers on the street, including a police officer and ambulance workers he had previously been chatting to, and walked quickly away.When asked for his comments on the commemorations and why he had chosen to ignore the lockdown to attend the Cenotaph, he echoed the thoughts of a nation.

It is said to be\u0026nbspan improvement on the\u0026nbspShenzhou\u0026nbspcapsule based on the former Soviet Union’s Soyuz model and can carry six astronauts instead of three.The spacecraft was flying stably in a “highly elliptical orbit, with the power supply, measurements and control links normal”, the official China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation had said earlier, following reports of the issues, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.China is working on a permanent orbiting station after being excluded from the International Space Station, largely because of US\u0026nbspobjections.Beijing previously\u0026nbsplaunched an experimental space station and plans four crewed and four cargo missions to finish a permanent space station within about two years.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Together they are expected to help contribute towards observations from telescopes like Hubble and data from the Juno spacecraft to better understand our still mysterious, huge neighbour.NASA images of Jupiter turned into beautiful abstract artworksThe Gemini data were critical because they allowed us to probe deeply into Jupiter\u0027s clouds on a regular schedule, said Michael Wong of UC Berkeley.The scientists used a technique called lucky imaging, Wong said, which sees scientists take a vast number of very short exposure images, but filters them so that only the sharpest images taken when Earth\u0027s atmosphere is stable are used. That allowed the scientists to create images that rival the view from space, Wong said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have come to the end of our tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing.”Created with Sketch. Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Amid the coronavirus pandemicIn a special address to the UK and the Commonwealth amid the coronavirus pandemic on 5 April 2020, the Queen said: “While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.211 After two tragic events in the UKIn 2017, the year that saw the terror attack in Manchester and Grenfell fire, the Queen reflected on the idea of home in her Christmas Day speech, saying:“We think of our homes as places of warmth, familiarity and love of shared stories and memories, which is perhaps why at this time of year so many return to where they grew up.  There is a timeless simplicity to the pull of home. 311 In a year with major disasters around the worldAfter a year where nations around the world were devastated by natural disasters – including flooding, tsunami, earthquake and hurricane – as well as the terror attack in London, the Queen said on her Christmas Day speech in 2005:“This series of dreadful events has brought loss and suffering to so many people - and their families and friends - not only in the countries directly affected, but here in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth.411 While visiting victims of the 2005 London terror attackFollowing terrorist bombings in London on 8 July 2005, the Queen said during a visit to some of the victims at Royal London Hospital:“Sadly we in Britain have been all too familiar with acts of terror and members of my generation, especially at this end of London, know that we have been here before. But those who perpetrate these brutal acts against innocent people should know that they will not change our way of life.511 In her Golden Jubilee yearThe Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 2002 with a tour of the nation as well as a summer of celebrations. On 2 June, with the Fifa World Cup in full swing, she told guests at a lunch at Guildhall:“I am more than conscious at the moment of the importance of football. Although this weekend comes about half way through my Jubilee year, as far as we are concerned, it bears no relation to a rest at \u0027half-time\u0027.611 At the turn of the millenniumFor her annual Christmas Day broadcast in 1999, the Queen reflected on the turn of the millennium, and the lessons we could learn, saying:“As I look to the future I have no doubt at all that the one certainty is change - and the pace of that change will only seem to increase…711 During her Golden Wedding AnniversaryAs the Queen celebrated her Golden Wedding Anniversary on 20 November 1997, she said:“What a remarkable fifty years they have been: for the world, for the Commonwealth and for Britain. Think what we would have missed if we had never heard the Beatles or seen Margot Fonteyn dance: never have watched television, used a mobile telephone or surfed the Net (or, to be honest, listened to other people talking about surfing the Net).811 Following the death of Diana, the Princess of WalesFollowing the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Queen addressed the nation on 5 September 1997:“We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. It is not easy to express a sense of loss, since the initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings: disbelief, incomprehension, anger - and concern for those who remain. We have all felt those emotions in these last few days.”On 24 November 1992, the Queen marked her “annus horribilis” – during which the royal family was marked with scandals from orce and affairs, to a devastating fire at Windsor Castle – in a speech at Guildhall to mark the 40th anniversary of her Accession. Her majesty reflected:“I sometimes wonder how future generations will judge the events of this tumultuous year. I dare say that history will take a slightly more moderate view than that of some contemporary commentators. Distance is well-known to lend enchantment, even to the less attractive views. After all, it has the inestimable advantage of hindsight.1011 Celebrating her Silver JubileeIn a speech celebrating her Silver Jubilee on 4 May 1977, the Queen noted:“These 25 years have seen much change for Britain. By virtue of tolerance and understanding, the Empire has evolved into a Commonwealth of 36 Independent Nations ning the five Continents. No longer an Imperial Power, we have been coming to terms with what this means for ourselves and for our relations with the rest of the world.1111 On her coronation dayAfter her coronation on 2 June 1953, the Queen addressed the nation in a broadcast that evening: The ceremonies you have seen today are ancient, and some of their origins are veiled in the mists of the past. But their spirit and their meaning shine through the ages never, perhaps, more brightly than now. 111 Amid the coronavirus pandemicIn a special address to the UK and the Commonwealth amid the coronavirus pandemic on 5 April 2020, the Queen said: “While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. This time we join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed - and that success will belong to every one of us.211 After two tragic events in the UKIn 2017, the year that saw the terror attack in Manchester and Grenfell fire, the Queen reflected on the idea of home in her Christmas Day speech, saying:“We think of our homes as places of warmth, familiarity and love of shared stories and memories, which is perhaps why at this time of year so many return to where they grew up.  There is a timeless simplicity to the pull of home. 311 In a year with major disasters around the worldAfter a year where nations around the world were devastated by natural disasters – including flooding, tsunami, earthquake and hurricane – as well as the terror attack in London, the Queen said on her Christmas Day speech in 2005:“This series of dreadful events has brought loss and suffering to so many people - and their families and friends - not only in the countries directly affected, but here in Britain and throughout the Commonwealth.411 While visiting victims of the 2005 London terror attackFollowing terrorist bombings in London on 8 July 2005, the Queen said during a visit to some of the victims at Royal London Hospital:“Sadly we in Britain have been all too familiar with acts of terror and members of my generation, especially at this end of London, know that we have been here before. But those who perpetrate these brutal acts against innocent people should know that they will not change our way of life.511 In her Golden Jubilee yearThe Queen celebrated her Golden Jubilee in 2002 with a tour of the nation as well as a summer of celebrations. On 2 June, with the Fifa World Cup in full swing, she told guests at a lunch at Guildhall:“I am more than conscious at the moment of the importance of football. Although this weekend comes about half way through my Jubilee year, as far as we are concerned, it bears no relation to a rest at \u0027half-time\u0027.611 At the turn of the millenniumFor her annual Christmas Day broadcast in 1999, the Queen reflected on the turn of the millennium, and the lessons we could learn, saying:“As I look to the future I have no doubt at all that the one certainty is change - and the pace of that change will only seem to increase…711 During her Golden Wedding AnniversaryAs the Queen celebrated her Golden Wedding Anniversary on 20 November 1997, she said:“What a remarkable fifty years they have been: for the world, for the Commonwealth and for Britain. Think what we would have missed if we had never heard the Beatles or seen Margot Fonteyn dance: never have watched television, used a mobile telephone or surfed the Net (or, to be honest, listened to other people talking about surfing the Net).811 Following the death of Diana, the Princess of WalesFollowing the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Queen addressed the nation on 5 September 1997:“We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. It is not easy to express a sense of loss, since the initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings: disbelief, incomprehension, anger - and concern for those who remain. We have all felt those emotions in these last few days.”On 24 November 1992, the Queen marked her “annus horribilis” – during which the royal family was marked with scandals from orce and affairs, to a devastating fire at Windsor Castle – in a speech at Guildhall to mark the 40th anniversary of her Accession. Her majesty reflected:“I sometimes wonder how future generations will judge the events of this tumultuous year. I dare say that history will take a slightly more moderate view than that of some contemporary commentators. Distance is well-known to lend enchantment, even to the less attractive views. After all, it has the inestimable advantage of hindsight.1011 Celebrating her Silver JubileeIn a speech celebrating her Silver Jubilee on 4 May 1977, the Queen noted:“These 25 years have seen much change for Britain.

But their spirit and their meaning shine through the ages never, perhaps, more brightly than now. The Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, started the war as a schoolgirl but ended it in uniform as a junior commander with the Auxiliary Territorial Service.“At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,” the Queen said in her\u0026nbspmessage, sitting next to a photograph of her father in Windsor Castle.“But we kept faith that the cause was right – and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through.“Never give up, never despair – that was the message of VE Day.“I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.Read Queen’s VE Day speech in full“The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrifice.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations.”She continued:\u0026nbsp “Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.“But our streets are not empty they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.”After the broadcast, the nation was invited to open doors and windows and take part in sing-a-long of Dame Vera Lynn’s wartime anthem “We’ll Meet Again”.It was the Queen’s\u0026nbspsecond televised address during the coronavirus outbreak, following her speech to the country on 5 April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That’s his choice,” she tweeted on Thursday.Mr Polk replied: “Thanks for the support mayor!”Explaining his reasons for recalling the mayor, Mr Polk said he doesn’t only want to recall her for wanting to “reopen Las Vegas” in the midst of a pandemic, but also for putting casino owners’ interests above those of the people of the city.“I don’t want to recall the mayor just because she wants to re-open Las Vegas,” he tweeted.“She also cares more about the ‘sensitive’ casino owners interests than the people of Las Vegas. Additionally, she was unable to maintain a conversation with functional sentences.”Ms Goodman’s interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper\u0026nbspwent viral partly due to\u0026nbspher stance on\u0026nbspreopening the city\u0026nbspand her apparent refusal to link the low number of cases with\u0026nbspeffective social distancing, and partly due to\u0026nbspMr Cooper’s disbelief and frustration at\u0026nbspher answers to his questions.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Left party, the fifth largest in the Bundestag,\u0026nbspwants to raise it to 27.Green legislators wrote: “Only minors are to be protected from this life-endangering charlatanry.

If Boris Johnson is to get our flatlining economy going again, he and his Government must prove to the public that lockdown restrictions can be lted sensibly and safely.And that’s where homemade masks come in. Yes, we know they’re not perfect. But mounting evidence proves that insisting on their use in confined spaces can help slow the spread of the virus, and — crucially — they lend confidence.One way or another, it’s becoming crystal clear that after lockdown Britain will be very dferent from the country we remember. Gone are the days of a post-work pint in the pub to wind down:ministers permit us to socialise, it will be only for picnics, and only with those we consider our close friends.But with the economy on its knees, we must throw everything we’ve got at creating a “new normal” to tide us over until a vaccine can be found.Andmasks are part of that, then let’s get Britain sewing.OFFICIALS must stop hiding behind corona-jargon and start explaining in plain English exactly what they want from us.Guidance states thatyou’re classed as “extremely clinically vulnerable” you’re supposed to “shield”, andyou’re considered “clinically vulnerable” you should be “closely following social distancing rules”.The problem is thatyou’re over  and not in the habit of scrutinising government websites, you may understandably not know what the dference between those terms is. And so could be putting yourself through the misery of a  week self-isolation unnecessarily.Brits have given up most of their cherished liberties at the drop of a hat. Many of them have sacriced their jobs too.The very least they are owed is clear, comprehensive guidance on what the new normal is supposed to look like.THE news that McDonald’s will open  of its stores next week has cheered us up.Yes, it’s a blow that the lockdown menu is limited and some fan favourites didn’t make the cut.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery. We should all be invested in British companies’ success.The better they do, the more jobs they create, the more they can pay, the better le is. Yes, there is a risk to getting the young back to work.But witness the orderly queues outside supermarkets and the pavement shuffle dance that we have all perfected to give each other space.The public, young and old, understand the threat of this virus.We invented all these video apps everyone is now socialising on. We are more than happy to use them for a little while longer.As for employers, they have built everything from thriving construction businesses to high-tech apps.It is not going to be beyond them to install plastic screens in the office, and nor are Lisa in marketing and Phil in accounts going to make like Professor Pantsdown in the filing cupboard.Are we prepared to trust our fellow Brits, take that risk and allow the next generation a better chance to succeed Even some of those in the highest at-risk groups will acknowledge we cannot live in economic shutdown forever.Even the boffins at Oxford know a vaccine will take months,not years.AndTikTok-ing millennials are not exactly winning much sympathy, what about the parents of young kids Anybody looking after children at home right now knows full well their productivity is close to zero.They need schools and nurseries open, too.Britain’s most dynamic cities and companies are being driven by the young, from the video game industry in Dundee to the start-up hubs of Shoreditch.They have had a decade of flatlining wages, a housing crisis and now the corona crash. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering.

The scheme was designed to find work for jobless Brits.Mr Darling told Radio : The one thing we should learn about this is that the Government is not only the lender of last resort, it is also the insurer of last resort, it has got a duty to ensure that as far as we possibly can, people who lose their jobs are helped to get back into dferent employmentthat is necessary.He added: But for those people who are not going to be able to get back to work or will see signicant income reductions then only at the end of the day the Government can step in - that is what it is for.Airport and ground handling companies have called for a tapered end to the Governments job retention schemein a bid to avoid job losses.Organisations including Airlines UK, the Airport Operators Association, Swissport and Menzies Aviation have written to the Prime Minister to stress the absolute necessity of a flexible end to the scheme amid expectations of an easing to the economic lockdown.Between the airports, airlines and ground handling businesses, tens of thousands of staff are furloughed under the scheme.The industry is warning it will not be in a position tothem all to work at the current end date next month and is likely to make a signicant number of the redundancies the JRS was designed to avoid.Without a flexible or tapered end to the scheme, the industry will not be able to support the economic recovery, the letter warns.FSB boss Mike Cherry said: “Today’s figures are a stark reminder that millions of jobs are stake in the weeks ahead. As we look to recovery, small firms must be allowed to get back on their feet one step at a time –  million jobs depend on it.“Our members are telling us in no uncertain terms that part-time furloughing is the way forward - allowing staff toto work for a few days a week while remaining furloughed for days when they’re not required.“The economy is not suddenly going to start firing on all cylinders overnight. Adjustments to the job retention scheme need to reflect that fact.“Government must avoid applying sector straightjackets that don’t work for small firms. There are far too many businesses that don’t fit neatly into one box, like small companies that mainly supply to hotels, but aren’t classed as hospitality firms.“We need to see these changes made from the beginning of June as small businesses begin to restart. Orders are going unfulfilled because a few hours work doesn’t justy bringing somebody off furlough.Businesses can’t even quote for jobs to be completed once restrictions are eased. Time is of the essence.”Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said Sunak should look at offering dferent furlough rates to workers in sectors of the economy which can begin reopening as part of the coronavirus recovery plan.He said there was an incredibly dficult and fine judgment to be made as some sectors of the economy were unlikely to ever fully recover.The respected think tank boss said: One of the big questions for Government in moving away from furlough policy is the extent to which it is able to do that dferentially by sector.You might think that the current system of really quite generous payments is appropriate for those sectors that have to remain locked down - so supposing you work in a bar or a restaurant you might think thats reasonable.The IFS also presented new research that revealed Britains lowest paid workers are in jobs that are least able to do remotely - exposing how the coronavirus lockdown has hit the poorest the hardest.The think tanks Rob Joyce said it is easier to work at home in higher paid occupations such as corporate managers, business managers, scientists, engineers, business associates and customer services.But lower paid jobs such as hospitality jobs, farming, sales, leisure and travel jobs are much harder to do from home, making “a lockdown especially problematic for lower earners on average”.Meanwhile new figures from the Office for National Statistics gave a rare positive boost, showing more than three quarers of firms in the UK were still trading despite the lockdown.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacriced so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a ‘great deliverance’.“The war had been a total war it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve, families separated from each other, or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play.”In an echo of today’s events, she went on: “At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain.“But we kept faith that the cause was right — and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through. Never give up, never despair — that was the message of VE Day.”Footage showed the then-Princess Elizabeth joining her family and Winston Churchill at Buckingham Palace to celebrate victory in Europe.With a photo of the triumphant scene behind her, the Queen went on: “I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.“The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrice.“It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended.“Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict. They fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad. They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations.“They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe. We should and will remember them.“As I now reflect on my father’s words and the joyous celebrations, which some of us experienced first-hand, I am thankful for the strength and courage that the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed.“The wartime generation knew the best way to honour those who did not come back from the war was to ensure it didn’t happen again.“The greatest tribute to their sacrice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all.”More film showed joyous crowds celebrating in the streets and doing the conga — not currently possible because of social distancing rules.The Queen said: “Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish.“Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps.“But our streets are not empty they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.“And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.

Pubs are losing cash fast. We’d ask the Government to recognise the real jeopardy.”UK pubs began the year on a high with the announcement of a beer duty freeze plus business rate support. Weeks later, lockdown began and they shut. Most did not have insurance to cover losses in the event of a major virus.Despite initial care packages including grants of up to £,, three-quarters of pubs and breweries are still waiting to hear whether they are to receive help.Greg Grundy, landlord of The Egremont in Worthing, West Sussex, said the Government faces a “race against the clock” to stop Britain’s pubs going under for good.He said: “I was very grateful to receive a £, grant and learn my £, business rates were suspended. But publicans are running out of the money and there’s no way the industry can last until September.“Since getting the grant, I’ve paid nearly £, for an annual insurance renewal, National Insurance for March of £,, utilities of £, and bookkeeping and accountancy fees of £ a month to make sure furloughed staff are paid correctly.”He said pubs with rateable values exceeding £, face a “further nightmare” as they receive no grant.He added: “The Government needs to extend grants, cash needs to be made available to more firms and the industry needs another rescue drive to save it from total destruction.”He said landlords who manage to stay open are not expecting a flood of custom.He added: “We’re anticipating huge apprehension from punters and social distancing rules are still likely to be in place, which will hit coffers badly.”Several breweries have been accused of pushing pubs towards oblivion by demanding rent while they are shut. Among them are Star Pubs  Bars, owned by Heineken.Ei Group plc, which runs , pubs but is based in the Cayman Islands tax haven, is checking up on landlords to see who has received a bailout.Gary Murphy, who runs Ye Olde Mitre Inne in Barnet, North London, pays £, a month rent to Greene King. It has been deferred from March.Three months’ rent will gobble up all but £, of his government grant. He said: “They want full rent during closure and full rent when we reopen.They also want us to continue to pay their extortionate tied beer prices.“It is impossible and they are completely deludedthey think that a £, or £, grant is going to weather this storm for publicanswe have to pay rent when we have no income.”Tory MP Mike Wood said the companies “risk killing the goose that lays the golden egg” by charging sky-high rents and expecting all the cash eventhey are deferring payments.Greene King said it was not asking for rent during lockdown and was contacting tenants inidually to discuss extra financial support, especially for pubs which get no government help.While there remains little hope of UK boozers reopening soon, Danish and Swiss bars are set to start serving again on Monday, followed by Austria next Friday. Germany is aiming for a “controlled reopening” from the weekend.Portugal, France and the Netherlands are looking at this month and June but some UK landlords see “no point” under the proposed “new normal”.Frank Keane, of The Ship near Marylebone, central London, said: “It’s going to be impossible with social distancing, staff working staggered days, office workers working from home. There’ll be no encouragement to stay out after work for drinks with colleagues. Tesco and Sainsbury’s can sell booze all day long but we’ll be running a race with one leg.“I’d rather stay closed with the Government extending grants and support until after the New Year than open and not be able to trade properly. The Government needs to save us, fast.”One ale fan, meanwhile, has made an “instant success” of delivering draught pints to punters at home.

But lockdown has given us a glimpse of how we could make our communities less polluted and cities less dangerous for our children.There is one element of this new reality we should keep — and data shows the public is up for it. Because even when a vaccine is found and lockdowns are eased, climate change still threatens us.This week the Government’s Public Attitudes Survey found  per cent of the population count themselves as concerned about global warming.Last month set a new UK record for the sunniest April, with an average . hours of sunshine, beating the previous record of . hours in April .We are already seeing the impact of global warming here in the UK as extreme weather becomes the new normal. April was .C above average, accompanied by devastating floods, and quite rightly the public is worried about climate change.I believe we would all back initiatives that protect our futures. Indeed, the UN has warned the climate crisis is a “deeper emergency” than Covid-.As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last month: “Bioersity is in steep decline. Climate disruption is approaching a point of no . We must act decisively to protect our planet from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption.”Make no mistake, this is a one-off opportunity to reset our economies, enabling them to grow back stronger but also stop our contributions to global warming.We have seen two main developments during this pandemic which hold the key to tackling global warming: Huge reductions in carbon-dioxide emissions and people changing deeply ingrained habits — quickly — bringing benefits to our health, nature and finances.As we stay at home, the lower rates of road and air travel have meant emissions of carbon dioxide have reduced massively around the world. Lowering the rates of this greenhouse gas is key to tackling global warming.By the end of March, global road transport activity was almost half of ’s average and demand for jet fuel is down  per cent year-on-year to April, according to the IEA International Energy Agency.Not only are we creating less pollution, we are also discovering healthier modes of transport. We are walking and cycling more. Our bike shops are running out of stock as we get on two wheels — to exercise during lockdown but also to prepare for the post-lockdown world.With the rise in demand for cycles, it would be greatthe Government could permanently expand cycle lanes and pavements, allowing citizens to enjoy towns and to clean up the air we breathe.This has already happened in Paris, which is rolling out km of “corona cycle-ways” and Milan, which is prioritising pedestrians and cyclists.Even the AA, which for years has been seen as the voice of motorists, has asked the Government to think again about its £billion road expansion. Its president Edmund King has suggested the funds would be better invested in improving broadband.Iniduals and businesses have learned how to operate remotely and from people’s homes, again reducing congestion and air pollution. The benefits to our health and environment will be enormousbusinesses and workers opt to work from home even after the pandemic passes.People are remembering, noticing and becoming more aware that what matters most is their health, their families, friendships and the environment. The constant pursuit of the latest model of car, phone, or jacket seems less important.Despite the global reductions in carbon emissions we cannot be complacent. Our recovery must have a green focus. The carbon emission drop that followed the  recession was followed by a sharp rise of almost six per cent the following year. Something similar could happen over the next few years and this would be catastrophic.Any public money given to private companies must be spent on public good, rather than bailing out polluting companies. Only those who are prepared to reduce carbon emissions should receive funding. Otherwise, our tax payers’ money is going on a very bad bet.Oil prices are plummeting. Fossil fuels are not a wise investment and any polluting company that is not willing to change does not deserve our money.The French government has only agreed to bail out Air France on the condition it lowers its carbon footprint by half by .

As part of a chat on our podcast, Football, Feminism and Everything In Between, I was showing my daughter Grace some of my cuttings as a young journalist almost forty years ago. Grace, , and a child of the internet, finds it hilarious that her Mum and I both have dozens of cuttings books from our years as reporters. But actually they’re not a bad way to track social and cultural change. And it was a football story, one of my first by-lined pieces as a young Daily Mirror reporter in August , that stood out most. “A glossy new look for the champions” said the Page  headline, alongside a photo of model Carole Needham wearing nothing but a Liverpool FC shirt and a lovely smile.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening. “It will never look as good on a Liverpool player!” said my cheesy intro.“Model Carole Needham shows off the new look shirt the League champions will be wearing this season.” The story was in the next paragraph.“Crown Paints is paying the club £, over the next three years to have its name on their shirts and track suits.”Half a million quid  For three years  Current striker Mohammed Salah earns roughly that in a week, and today’s Standard Chartered shirt sponsorship deal with Liverpool is worth £m for one year. Though Liverpool are once again likely champions, that is a lot less than Chevrolet pay for having their brand on Manchester United’s famous red top, at £m.Even little old Burnley, one of ten Premier League clubs advertising gambling on their shirts, get £.m from LoveBet.  We now take it for granted that where once smoking and drinking dominated sports marketing, today it is gambling. But paragraph  in my yellowing cutting underlines just how big a change in football that represents. “A TV ban on advertising means that millions of viewers will never see the slogan. Liverpool will wear plain shirts when their matches are televised.” Today, it is unthinkable that any Liverpool game, any Premier League game, any professional game at all, would NOT be televised, with slogans and adverts and marketing gimmicks left, right and centre.  But back then, it wasn’t simply that you couldn’t have gambling messaging on shirts. You couldn’t have paint companies. You couldn’t have anything. Indeed the club’s first sponsor, Hitachi, pulled out of their deal because of the TV ban. And how about this from Football League marketing manager Graham Walker, arguing for that ban to be lted  “The game is starved of money. If the TV companies would lt the ban there would be tremendous interest in shirt advertising. We are talking about millions of pounds which are desperately needed. As gate revenue falls the need for sponsorship increases.”  Crown Paints marketing director Gordon Fearnley went further. “At the moment, the game is plain boring. The venues are uncomfortable and dficult to get to. But I think the commercial world can help the sport sort itself out. “The TV companies are hypocrites. You only have to look at a cricket or tennis match or a golf championship to see sponsors’ advertising all over the place.” That last point is so true. Cigarette companies were all over cricket and golf, horse racing and snooker back then. But what about all that “plain boring … dreadful venues … game starved of money”   This was pre the triple disasters of Heysel, Hillsborough, and the Bradford City fire, all of which I covered for the Mirror. But it all just shows how much the advent of the Premier League ten years later in , and the accompanying TV revolution, changed things. In so many ways, not all good but most not bad, my kids would not recognise the football of that era. Nobody today can say with a straight face: ’The game is starved of money.’Yet no matter how much the top players and managers earn, lower down the football pyramid many clubs could face an existential threat. Leeds United look set to be promoted. If for any reason they are not, will their players nonetheless insist on the huge bonuses they have in their contracts for finishing top of the league Would Leeds, with its troubled financial history, even survivethe investment they have put in did not lead them back to the Premier League  Some doubt it.  Then lower down the leagues, many of the clubs face a really uncertain future. Some will almost certainly vanish, at a time Covid-battered communities may need them more than ever, not least because football is a major employer of people other than players.We need to understand football’s contribution to the economy as well as to our entertainment. That is why there is such a determination to get football back up and running again. The sums of money that stand to be won, lost, or subject to legal wrangles for months and years ahead, are too big for the game to go into long term abeyance. The French have abandoned their league and a legal minefield is now exploding. The explosions in England’s much richer league would be louder and longer-lasting.  Though clubs of course welcome money through the turnstiles, and though football without fans is a far less exciting spectacle, it is the TV money that really matters to the ‘big clubs’ meeting next week to decide how to proceed. And it explains why, other than from those likely to be relegated, there is such a desire to get the season done, whatever it takes, to coin a political slogan or two. The Premier League’s broadcast rights globally are worth £. billion for the  to  cycle. There are countries with smaller GDP than that. Though the value of the domestic rights dipped, overseas broadcasters were paying % more, which more than makes up that loss. So foreign companies that have acquired rights to every Premier League game until  are paying £. billion, up from £. billion during the previous three-year cycle. At my own club, Burnley, % of revenue comes from TV money, just five percent from ticket sales. And evena good deal of it ends up with the players, the truth is that football is possible though inferior without fans, but totally impossible without players. Understandably given how much they earn, there is a lot of focus on footballers, a lot of jealousy, and a fair bit of snobbery too. But they are in so many ways the TV and movie stars of yesteryear.  Added to which, as Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish pointed out recently, football and footballers pay around £.billion each year in tax, and the Premier League funds a good deal of the football pyramid. He had a wonderful phrase to describe football. “Magnicently meaningless”.Is the loss I feel at not having seen a Burnley game for several weeks on a par with the loss of a loved one to Covid No. But it is a loss. Is my anxiety that when games come back, I won’t be able to be there in person, on a par with the anxiety of a parent whose son or daughter is in intensive care No. But it’s still real. Because the pleasure I am missing is real. The community I am missing is real. And getting back to it in some shape or form is going to be an important part of exit from the bizarre state in which we have been living. That is meaningful, not meaningless.

This could mean Brits will have to take one month offthey want to go on a two-week holiday, sparking fears of an end to summer holidays this year and leading to calls for clarity from the tourism industry.The move is set to be announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in his address to the nation tomorrow, the Times reports, and the measure is expected to be implemented in June.The paper reports that authorities will conduct spot checks, with punishments for those not adhering to the rules including fines of up to £, and deportation.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at  mirror email  -after the press conference every evening. A Home Office spokeswoman said: We do not comment on leaks. The focus remains on staying at home to protect the NHS and save lives. The aviation industry is calling on the Government to reveal specics of the proposal amid concerns that the measures could have severe repercussions for the travel and tourism sectors.We need to see the details of what they are proposing, Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and other UK-based airlines, said in a statement.Airlines UK issued a statement saying the proposal would effectively kill international travel to and from UK and cause immeasurable damage to the aviation industry and wider UK economy. For the latest coronavirus updates, follow our liveblog It added: Nobody is going to go on holidaytheyaposre not able to resume normal le for  days, and business travel would be severely restricted. It will also make it all but impossible for aviation to resume any time soon, thereby setting back the UKaposs economic recovery still further. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast: Itaposs something that weaposve been asking ministers to clary for weeks now. I raised it with the minister for the fth time on Thursday because itaposs caused real confusion.  At the moment weaposve got a lot of Britons who are still stranded abroad. People have been brought back in relatively large numbers and many of them are telling us that they have no information or advice given out about what they should be doing when they get home. They travel back from the airport on public transport, they go back to their families and theyaposre worried that theyaposre putting their families and other members of the public at risk, and some of them are coming from parts of the country where we are seeing an increase in infection rates, and so theyaposre really worried about it, the wider public are really worried about it, and for weeks weaposve had mixed messages being briefed out of government. She added: I think thereaposs a real reluctance to do anything without official advice at the moment, so I donapost think the big problem is getting people to follow it.  The big problem is actually getting that advice to people in the first place and itaposs been far too slow and far too confusing for most people. Thereaposs also a very real outstanding issue about the way in which people are being brought back into the country. A lot of the cases that Iaposm dealing with - my office is in touch with around , British nationals who are still stranded abroad - is about how they get to the airport on the other side of the border. People travelling across Spain, for example, on coaches, they get to the airport, itaposs very crowded, theyaposre being crammed onto planes without social distancing measures in place.  Some of them are telling me thereaposs no hand gel available. Then, of course, thereaposs no testing facilities when they arrived back into the UK, so itaposs welcome that the Government has started to respond to this, but weaposve got to get much, much quicker at this or weaposre going to see a resurgence in cases. The ISU union - which represents borders, immigration and customs staff - called for clarity on the quarantine plans. ISU professional officer Lucy Moreton told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: At the moment this is just a leak, so we havenapost had any particular information.  Thereaposs a little bit of a discrepancy about whether this is airline passengers only or whether this is going to include iniduals arriving by boat. And what are we going to do with the irregular migrants who donapost have a private house to self-isolate in  Seemingly frustrated about no concrete information, she added: Iaposm hoping someone will get round to telling the staff at some point. She also questioned how it will be implemented, saying: Thereaposs no way for that e-gate to collect an address so weaposd have to do something, either shut those down completely or post staff either before or after to collect addresses.  Airport Operators Associationchief executive Karen Dee said she has not received any details yet about a mandatory -day quarantine for all travellers into the UK. She told BBC Breakfast: I think thereaposs been lots of speculation in the press recently, and of course the transport secretary was on the Andrew Marr show last week, so although we havenapost had any details yet thereaposs been a lot of speculation that there will be a -day quarantine for passengers ing to the UK. That would have a really big impact on our sector, but at the moment we donapost have very much detail about what that would mean.  Ms Dee added: We see passenger numbers typically down by about % now in the UK. So, you know, a lot of airports now are closed for passenger traffic. There are very few flights coming in and that means no revenue, so weaposre really having to adjust and see our way through. The AOA chief executive said it was not known exactly what measures will be brought in for air travel. She told BBC Breakfast: Weaposre not medical experts and thataposs why weaposre keen to work with government and internationally to say what are the best things that we can do   Is it better cleaning and sanitation or hand sanitisers in the airport  Is it face masks and gloves for passengers to avoid touching  Is it some form of temperature checks at the airports or before they travel  Or other kind of testing that might evolve in the next few days or weeks  So at the moment, it could be a range of those options. She added: I think that there will be a range of things that passengers will see once we begin to scale back up, but at the moment I think itaposs really important that governments work with each other to say aposletaposs get one single international standardapos so that passengers know what theyaposre going to expect, wherever they are that theyaposre travellingapos.  It was put to Ms Dee that it would seem she has not had clear notication or clear guidance from the Government yet about what needs to be put in place. Asked what her impression is of not having had clarity, she told BBC Breakfast: I think the problem with that lack of clarity means that weaposre unable to plan. So, you know, itaposs perhaps not surprising that we donapost have that standard agreed, and we know that the Government is working now very closely, both with the industry and internationally, to look at what the science tells us we should do. So it is a problem as we begin to start and we will see some flights begin to take off, mostly repatriation at the moment of course, but I think it causes some confusion and what weaposre really keen to ensure is that those passengers that do begin to come back to us feel reassured, and also our staff. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport Newquay, warned of uncertainty for staff and businesses from reports of a -day quarantine for travellers entering the UK. He was generally critical of the Governmentaposs handling of borders, telling BBC Radio aposs Today programme: It was possibly inevitable but to say that itaposs come too late would be something of an understatement. He added that questioning the management and the planning of this is going to be very much at the forefront today. Now it does look that even though weaposre potentially past the peak weaposre going to close our borders and all the plans that airlines and airports had to start restarting operations are now on the scrapheap and will have to go back to square one, he continued.

The open letter, compiled by The Doctors’ Association UK, comes after polling showed one in five frontline medics have been given unusable PPE. And it follows the latest PPE disaster for the Government as surgical gowns in a promised shipment of , pieces of kit from Turkey failed safety tests. The letter, signed by , as of tonight, states: “Doctors are dying. Nurses are dying. for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead.This is unforgivable. We need a commitment to this now, with a full judge-led inquiry once the Covid- crisis is over. It is also crucial coroners open inquests into each healthcare worker death in addition to a public inquiry. This will ensure evidence is preserved and each death is properly investigated.” But the Chief Coroner has warned that verdicts of inquests on NHS staff deaths will not address PPE supply problems. In guidance, Mark Lucraft QC said while inquests could consider failures in the workplace which may have contributed to deaths – including lack of PPE – they are not the right forum to address national shortages and supply issues. The vast majority of our , virus deaths will not require an inquest as rules class them as the “natural progression of a naturally occurring disease”. Top QC Theo Huckle, one of the open letter’s signatories, said an inquiry on “the greatest sacrice possible by those who have worked so selflessly to protect us” is vital. But he also stressed coroner’s inquests are vital in letting bereaved families be heard and get answers.  Mr Huckle said: “At this terrible time for the bereaved families of the lost frontline workers, it is vital they are reassured they will be given access to justice to understand how they suffered their loss. “Undoubtedly, a public inquiry will be required at the end of this pandemic. “But as we can see from the ongoing Grenfell Tower and child abuse enquiries, these can be extremely slow and most importantly they do not permit the families their own representation and the ability to ask the questions they need answered. That is what the coroner’s inquest so successfully achieves and we only have to look at the success of the full Hillsborough inquest to see that.” Deb Coles, director of charity Inquest, which campaigns on state-related deaths, added: “Both Inquest and its lawyers group are deeply concerned about the Chief Coroner’s guidance. Inquests can play a vital role in ensuring deaths of healthcare workers can be properly scrutinised. “Until a public inquiry is called, bereaved families must look to ­coroners to open investigations so evidence can be preserved.” The Mirror’s Protect Us campaign is demanding proper PPE for all key workers. Channel  News reported on Thursday that % of , boxes of PPE in the Government’s stockpile had expired when the crisis began and had to be re-tested. It claimed % of  million stockpiled respirators were out of date. The Health Care Supply Association said it was aware of several deliveries sent from the Government’s central supply chain that were “followed by calls for them to quarantine or not use the PPE as it does not meet minimum standards”. The Government ordered its latest PPE shipment from Turkish T-shirt firm Selegna Tekstil, with thousands of items now deemed “useless” and lying in a warehouse near Heathrow. Only , of the , gowns have been transported to the UK. Of these, , failed tests, , passed and the rest are being assessed.  Around , more are reportedly still in Turkey, after officials blocked delivery over safety fears. And polling by DAUK raised fears faulty face masks and surgical gowns are still being delivered to hospitals. Chair Dr Rinesh Parmar said: “It is vitally important these challenges are seen as an opportunity to learn. “We need to ensure no healthcare worker is put in harm’s way in this manner again and the families get answers. [We have] been lobbying to ensure coroner’s inquests are commenced in every healthcare worker death. This will facilitate the preservation of evidence for a full public inquiry or future legal action.” As well as being criticised for neglecting stockpiles, the Government was slammed for being slow to use – or even ignoring – firms that offered to source or make PPE.

But a Boris Johnson ally has warned that just baby steps will be announced by the Prime Minister and the public should expect some measures to continue for months. The Covid- lockdown was formally extended on Thursday for another three weeks following a review, and parts of it could be lted every two weeks. When the Prime Minister addresses the nation on Sunday night, he is expected to announce his roadmap for easing restrictions while still trying to prevent infections. But the lockdown is set to remain in place until at least June as outbreaks in care homes and hospitals have made large-scale changes before then too dangerous.to get the Mirror’s daily coronavirus briefing email at mirror email -after the press conference every evening. The lockdown is facing a major test from a long weekend of warm weather and concerns of mixed messaging ahead of Mr Johnsonaposs announcement, as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales weigh whether and when to make changes of their own. The Prime Minister has been urged to reveal a timeline and identy specic dates when certain measures will be lted amid fears for the economy and businesses, although ministers have warned that only modest or limited moves are likely. The UK is past its peak and the number of confirmed cases and deaths trending down. However, it has the highest death toll in Europe - more than , - and the second highest in the world behind only the US. There are fears a second wave could eruptthe restrictions are eased too soon and Britons donapost follow social distancing rules. The Mirror reported this week that the Government has a five-stage exit strategy staggered over the next six months, and a -page blueprint has been drawn up to get the country back to normal. Here are the changes that are expected from Monday. Monday Mr Johnson is expected to set out a rough timetable for lting key restrictions such as reopening schools and shops, but will stress that tough milestones must be reached before that can happen. He is likely to announce that people will be allowed unlimited exercise from Monday, ending the once-a-day restriction that has been in place since the unprecedented lockdown came into effect on March . The blueprint called for employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open during the lockdownsafe.  Guidance for adapting workplaces to make them safer could be introduced. The Government could also allow places of worship, including churches and mosques, to open for private prayer but not for gatherings of groups. It is possible that garden centres will be given the OK to partially reopen, at least, although this is said to be one of the most contentious issues within cabinet. There may be further guidance on the use of outdoor spaces including open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions in the country would continue for a further three weeks, with three modest adjustments from Monday.  People will be allowed to exercise more than once a day but they must not travel to do so, with the exercise beginning and ending at home. The second change is to allow garden centres to reopenthey can observe social distancing rules. Local authorities will also be able to begin planning how to open libraries and municipal recycling centres. Mr Drakeford said on Friday: These very cautious changes will apply to everyone other than the , people in the shielding group. We continue to urge people who are over , or who have an underlying health condition, or who are pregnant, to continue to take extra care.  Confirming that the lockdown would be extended in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the Scottish Government is looking into expanding the current guidance over exercise. Advice for Scots currently states that exercise should be limited to one hour per day. Ms Sturgeon said: The only change that weaposre considering in the immediate term is the guidance on outdoor exercise, as I mentioned yesterday and I will give you a further update on that over the weekend.

Iaposve not got anything for you today and I wouldnapost want to pre-empt what we have to say in the future. I think ministers have said the issue of looking to ensure, as we really drive down transmission in the UK, that we are enable to ensure the virus is not being brought into the country from overseas is one they are actively considering. aposItaposs a bit of a shamblesapos The plans are due to be finalised over the weekend before Mr Johnson makes his televised address at pm on Sunday. Earlier this week, a Government source told the Mirror: “It’s a bit of a shambles. “Nobody can quite agree what to do and when to do it. Somebody comes up with a bright idea, but the practicalities get in the way. We’re not South Korea.”  Mr Johnson will keep Britain in lockdown until at least June after he was warned that it is too dangerous to make any signicant changes due to outbreaks in care homes and hospitals. He told his cabinet that he would proceed with “maximum caution” and modest changes before the end of May. A Government source told the Times: “It is baby steps taken slowly and only when it’s clear they can be taken. Plans to allow households to mix in a social bubble have slipped down the order of priorities because more work is needed, a source said, adding: “How do you enforce it  It could easily lead to a spike in transmissionit goes wrong.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce the measure on Sunday when he sets out his roadmap for how restrictions will gradually be lted. Although face masks will not be made compulsory, Brits are to be urged to wear them at work, on public transport and while out shopping to reduce the risk of a second wave of Covid- infections, thereports. It is expected that most people will be asked to wear non-medical coverings, to avoid running down supplies needed for NHS and social care staff, and other key workers. A cabinet minister told thethat it is hoped that the new guidance will give people the confidence to get back to work. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog hereThere is a theory that wearing masks might make people less vigilant, but this is about giving people confidence toto work, they said. If it makes people feel safer using public transport then it is a good thing, so we are leaning towards it. UK social distancing rules do not currently recommend that the public wear masks, with some experts warning that they could make people less likely to observe social distancing rules such as keeping a safe distance from each other. However, countries including Germany, Italy and the US have all recommended wearing some form of face covering in order to reduce new Covid- cases.Earlier this week, an evidence review submitted to the governmentaposs Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfound that face coverings could be at least half as effective as surgical masks in slowing the spread of the deadly bug. It comes after Cabinet Minister Michael Gove revealed last month that a domestic effort has been launched to produce face masks. He said the measure was intended to slow the spread of coronavirus by producing masks that limit the droplets that each of us might be responsible for.

Most of these businesses will open again on Wednesday after a seven-week enforced closure.A senior Government source said: Garden centres typically open large open-air spaces where the risk of transmission of coronavirus is lower.Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog With strict social distancing measures in place, we believe they can open safely from next week. It has already been confirmed garden centres in Wales will reopen on Monday. Cafes and playgrounds associated with the retail space wonapost be allowed to open in any garden centres across England and Wales, though. Speaking at a press briefing in Cardf today, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: Our second planned change to the regulations is to allow garden centres to reopen, provided the social distancing rules can be applied. . Unlimited exercise to be allowed . Employees to be encouraged toto workplaces that have stayed open throughout the lockdownsafe . You can visit garden centresthey reopen . You can make use of more outdoor spaces, including open-air markets . You can visit high streets and cemeteriesThese businesses, too, will enforce social distancing measures. UK supermarkets, for instance, have introduced queuing systems and one-way aisles to limit the interaction customers and staff have with one another, while also creating cleaning stations where trolley and basket handles can be disinfected. Extra cleaning regimes have been introduced and perspex screens installed for check-out staff - a pattern garden centres could be set to follow. It is unclear which other businesses,any, Mr Johnson will permit to reopen next week. It is believed garden centres have been selected because of the outdoor nature of their setting. Finances in the horticulture sector have been signicantly impacted by the lockdown.

The stunning four-bedroom home last had people living within its walls during the early s but it has never been empty, almost, its last owner, Ellen Jones, passed away. A former dairy farm dating back to , Red Dress Manor - as it is now called by locals - is officially Calcott Hall, in Llanymynech, Powys, Mid Wales. The Grade Two listed building stands proudly in the countryside but instead of a bustling family home it is now nothing more than a relic of a time decades ago. Following Ellenaposs death, all of her possessions have remained exactly as they are in her home. Hanging from one wardrobe door is the red dress that gives the empty home its nickname but it is far from the only belonging left behind from a forgotten time. Ellenaposs picture, including one of her in the red dress, hangs from the walls still covered in places in fading s floral wallpaper. Where the wallpaper has tumbled to earth, heavy stone covers the walls, harking back to the time the dairy farm was first built. Love letters and notes from friends strewn the floor and havenapost been read for almost  years, their personal messages now forgotten. Family snaps line the fireplace, black and white images of people long dead, as dust covers arms chairs and their cushions. Beds still have their covers on them and curtains still hang in the windows, many of them cracked and broken as nature forces its way into the house. Branches crawl along the walls, as leaves fill roof spaces and floors where people once trod.to get the Mirroraposs biggest and best stories delivered straight to your inbox at www.mirror email There are hum drum signs of le throughout the eerie home, with washing powder left on the side in the kitchen, plates, cups and pots and pans all still in the cupboards. And in Ellenaposs former bedroom, there are memories of a bygone time as her dressing table is still filled with remnants of make-up, brushes and a mirror.Lamps, covered in decades of cobwebs, and bottles which once contained th century cleaning products, line side tables and shelves - all now thick with dust. A TV from the s, no pictures or signs coming from it since the s. Newspapers, filled with news from years ago, are piled up in the living room. Photographer, Dan Circa, from Manchester, ventured into the home to capture it in all its eerie glory. He said: I heard stories of the manor and so wanted to investigate for myself.The picture of a lady in a red dress and the actual red dress still being there was particularly intriguing. I wanted to see what  was inside. I felt like I was in someoneaposs home uninvited, I expected the owner to walk round every corner I saw. When I climbed the stairs to enter the main bedroom, I opened the door and to the right there was a photo of the lady in the garment on her dressing table with all her makeup and other personal items on it. I then turned to the left and saw an open wardrobe with that red dress hung up, it was a very eerie feeling assomeone was there, and I thought it was her at first glance.

Police at first treated his death as “unexplained” but coroner Richard Travers heard he died from a brain haemorrhage and that detectives found “no suspicious circumstances”. Despite being a convicted conman, the inquest recorded Mr Halligen as an “intelligence and security officer”.

Halligen later denied claims the cash was siphoned off to pay for first-class travel, top hotels and a chauffeur.

I had been told it would be a  week break and although I had initially dealt with it pretty well after a couple of weeks my anxiety  was keeping me awake at night. What’s that cough  Why am I breathless  Corona or cancer  You literally question everything when you’re living with incurable cancer. But chemo is our security blanket, so to have it whipped from under us is terrying. Thank god my incredible oncologist got me started on it sooner than was planned.  I was absolutely delighted. It’s strange how you come to love things that make you tired and achy and sometimes poorly, because ultimately, it’s saving your le. Now I’m waiting for my three month scan - ‘scanxiety’ is always one of the hardest part of living with cancer but this one is going to be awful. I’m currently breathless allll the time, it’s not really anything new - it could be damage from radiotherapy as my left lung was at risk of being affected, it could be all the meds that I’m on but I’m almost certain it has nothing to do with all the wine and chocolate I’ve been consuming throughout lockdown. All I know is thatmy next scan comes back clear, there will be some flippin serious screaming going on in our house.I have managed to bag myself some full spectrum CBD oil from the Tonic Tribe, which is definitely taking the edge off. Here’s the  linkanybody wants to give it a try.Aside from cancer, le goes on. Homeschooling, work, cooking, family time, exercise - chill time and wine are what our days consist of. Although I have had to put the wine down midweek as it was becoming a liiiiitle bit too normal. I’m saving red wine for weekends from now on. I’ve also struggled to exercise because we’ve been in complete lockdown. I’ve only been leaving the house to have blood tests. I’ve decided that I’m going to invest in a Fitbit and challenge myself to do at least , steps a day in the garden. Excercise and a healthy diet can be crucial in combatting cancer and I’ve lost my way -  big time so I need to get back in the zone. Any tips are very much welcome. Home schooling is….a challenge. It must be so hard for our little babes. Massive changes, parents turned teachers, no interaction with their friends. Little changes are mammoth to children and even though it’s bloody stressful to try and get them to focus, we have to remind ourselves that everything is a bit scary in their little world right now. We were losing it with each other yesterday and it all became a bit heated. Ivy told us she wanted to be adopted. And that we were the worst mummy and daddy ever. Naturally we want to tell them off and reprimand them but we told her that we knew she was just feeling a bit fed up and we knew that she didn’t mean those hurtful words.

It is thought to be just , light years away in the star system HR , a distance scientists say is close enough to be seen by the naked eye. The discovery was unveiled on Wednesday in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.The cosmic object is understood to be four times the mass of the sun, but squeezed into the space of just a few kilometres, National Geographic reports.According to the magazine,in a model of the Milky Way the Earth was only a hairaposs distance away from the sun, HR  would be four miles away. In astronomy terms, this is so close that scientists believe the galaxy could be home to millions of other black holes, some of which may be even closer. This source is actually close enough to see with the naked eye. Thataposs what really stunned me about this discovery, Alan Duffy, an astronomer at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia explains.  He told news.au : It means we had this monster hiding in plain sight for years. For some reason we didnapost detect it earlier.For us to have a found a black hole so close to us means there must be hundreds of millions of these black holes in our galaxy.

As she spoke to the nation, she wore Boucheron aquamarine and diamond clip brooches given to her on her th birthday in  by King George VI. They Art Deco brooches were displayed publicly at Buckingham Palace during the  Summer Opening exhibition. They are made of aquamarine and diamonds, and in a typical s design combine baguette, oval and round stones. The Queen wore the same powder blue dress with the accessories in  during the award ceremony for the Queenaposs Anniversary Prizes for Higher and Further Education. It is thought to be one of her favourite pieces of jewellery. The dazzling brooches can be worn in a number of dferent ways: as matching clips, on either shoulder. Her Majesty usually wears them - as she did in her speech - as separate clips, one above the other, on her left shoulder.Meanwhile, the monarch recorded the address in The White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle and is her second broadcast in five weeks, following her national address about the  coronavirus  Covid- pandemic. The pm slot is the same time her father, King George VI, spoke to the country in a radio address on May  . In tonightaposs address, the Queen said: I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly  years ago. His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacriced so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a “great deliverance”.  The war had been a total war it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve families separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play. At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain.  But we kept faith that the cause was right - and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through. Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE Day. I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, thoughwhile we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrice. It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and thewar finally ended. Her Majesty is the last surviving head of state who served in World War Two, joining the Auxiliary Territorial Service in .

The monarch praised the countryaposs love and care on show in the dficult coronavirus lockdown.In just her sixth televised address during her -year reign, the Queen said the brave soldiers, sailors and airmen of Second World War would be proud of the heroes protecting lives in these unprecedented times. Before the Queenaposs speech, a video was played to the nation of her father King George VI making his VE address. He said: Let us remember the men of all the services and the women in all of the services who have laid down their lives. We have come to the end of our tribulation and they are not with us at the moment of our rejoicing. And the Queen, who is , largely echoed this message. Speaking in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, where the monarch is isolating with Prince Philip, , Her Majesty proudly displayed a photograph on her desk of her father in his Admiral of the Fleet unorm with RAF Wings. I speak to you today at the same hour as my father did, exactly  years ago, she said. His message then was a salute to the men and women at home and abroad who had sacriced so much in pursuit of what he rightly called a aposgreat deliveranceapos.  The war had been a total war it had affected everyone, and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve families separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play. At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain. Behind her on a separate table could be seen a photograph of teenage self with her father, mother and sister together with Winston Churchill on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on VE Day, Tuesday May , .  As a teenager who had joined the Auxiliary Territorial Serviceat the age of  in , the monarch recollected how she mischievously escaped the confines of the palace with her sister Margaret to rejoice in the streets, while honouring the sacrice of those that gave their lives. The Queen added: We kept faith that the cause was right - and this belief, as my father noted in his broadcast, carried us through. Never give up, never despair - that was the message of VE Day. I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace.  The sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound, though while we celebrated the victory in Europe, we knew there would be further sacrice. It was not until August that fighting in the Far East ceased and the war finally ended.Many people laid down their lives in that terrible conflict. They fought so we could live in peace, at home and abroad. They died so we could live as free people in a world of free nations. They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe. We should and will remember them.As I now reflect on my father’s words and the joyous celebrations, which some of us experienced first-hand, I am thankful for the strength and courage that the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and all our allies displayed.  The wartime generation knew that the best way to honour those who did not come back from the war, was to ensure that it didn’t happen again. The greatest tribute to their sacrice is that countries who were once sworn enemies are now friends, working side by side for the peace, health and prosperity of us all. Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish. Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty they are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.  And when I look at our country today, and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire. I send my warmest good wishes to you all. As millions across the country paused at am on Friday to remember those who served in the Second World War the poignant moment was led by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, who each laid a wreath at a memorial near Balmoral. Camilla placed spring flowers on the memorial, which were picked personally by Her Royal Highness from the garden at Birkhall. Charles’ handwritten message with his floral tribute read: “In everlasting remembrance”, while Camilla left a note with her bouquet in memory of her father Major Bruce Shand, who served with the th Lancers during the war. The duchess, who wore her  Rles dress, because she is Royal Colonel of the regiment, and her th Royal Lancers regimental brooch, wrote: “In memory of my darling father and all the officers and men of the XII Lancers who fought so bravely to give us peace.”  As part of the day’s commemorations, Prince Charles read an extract on the BBC from his grandfather’s diary from VE Day. Describing the day in detail, including how Prime Minister Winston Churchill “came to lunchwe congratulated each other on the end of the European War” as well as the royal family’s iconic Buckingham Palace balcony appearance. One passage referenced Charles’s mother, the Queen and her sister Princess Margaret as they famously escaped the palace and went incognito into the crowds that had gathered.  It read: “Lilibet and Margaret with a party of friends walked in the crowd after dark to see London in festive mood. Poor darlings, they have never had any fun yet.” As part of the commemorations the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were said to be “in awe” of stories of Churchill’s “secret” birthday message to his son when they chatted to Second World War veterans about their VE Day memories. Champagne was flowing when William and Kate made a video call on Wednesday to residents of an East Sussex care home to listen to them reminisce about the day the war ended in Europe on May , .

According to the Met Office, the south east of England is set to bask in blazing sunshine as the nation spends its seventh weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Temperatures are forecast to hit a summery C in London, Manchester and Cardf, and C in Edinburgh and Belfast. However, Brits are being warned to heed social distancing advice and stay at home ahead of an announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday setting out what le in the UK will look like over the coming weeks and months. While the south east is predicted to remain dry for most of the day, the afternoon could bring showers and possibly thunder to central parts of the UK. Fridayaposs bank holiday heatwave - which brought temperatures of C - saw Brits flock to parks with some continuing to ignore social distancing rules. Many headed to their nearest park or beach to celebrate the th anniversary of VE Day, which led to police moving people on. In London, a man was asked to go home by a police officer for sunbathing in Greenwich Park, while hundreds headed to Brighton beach to sunbathe. The warm spell is set to come to an abrupt end on Sunday, with the temperatures set to plummet by as much as C as a cold weather front moves in from northern Scotland. The chilly weather is set to bring overnight frosts to some parts of the country early next week, with most areas feeling notiably colder.

London and the South East will be hotter than Ibiza and St Tropez as temperatures rise - as Brits are warned they must stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus. It will be shortlived however - as temperatures will plunge by as much as C on Sunday, when a cold weather front moves in from northern parts of Scotland. Saturday will be bright for most in the UK, hitting highs of up to C in northern England, C in Northern Ireland, C in southern parts of Scotland and C in Wales by the afternoon. London and the South East could see the hottest temperatures recorded in the UK so far this year, potentially surpassing the C recorded in Treknow, in Cornwall, on Good Friday. It has led the Government to issue reminders to stay at home and obey social distancing rules amid fears people could flock to parks and beaches for days out.  There will be scattered showers across northern Scotland, with the chance of snow on the hills in the evening, with temperatures staying lower than C for the whole day. Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: Most of us will have some very warm and pleasant sunshine on Saturday, with London and the South East possibly surpassing the C mark, which would make it the hottest day of the year so far. This is because of southern winds coming in from Spain, which will make it warm and dry.

No one sneaked a snog from or danced the Lindy Hop with a rather attractive stranger. And the pubs once packed with euphoric punters stood empty and quiet while the bonfire parties and fireworks never got off the ground. But while coronavirus crisis had put a dampener on elaborate mass celebrations, the th anniversary of VE Day did not pass the nation by. Because Brits in isolation who have been coming out week by week to clap our front-line carers were determined to honour the heroes of the Second World War too. And, though far fewer in number, the lives lost to this new enemy and those being put on the line every day, mades us shed more tears for the millions of war dead and their grieving loved ones.for the Mirror Politics newsletter at www.mirror email -at .am to navigate the day ahead.So the mass street parties of  were replaced by socially-distanced ones in this strange, new world of two-metre distancing. But it could not stop a glorious sense of unity, hope and patriotism sweeping through Britain’s communities. Elderly people in isolation put up deck chairs in their front gardens, families set up barbecues on their drives and homes were decked in flags, bunting and red, white and blue balloons. And those still aching to be reunited with loved ones choked back tears as they sang the wartime anthem that is as poignant today. “We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when.....” Preparations began early as people wanted everything in place in time to join the moving two-minute silence. Then, as a Spitfire and Hurricane soared through blue sky over the white clfs of Dover a “skywriter” etched We Will Meet Again and Thank You above the skies of Henstridge airfield, Somerset. It was time to party... almost like it was . Locals In the village of Kelvedon, Essex, held tea parties. Clare Berrett, , joined in with her youngsters, Isabel, seven and Henry, four. She said: “It was a wonderful day and I think the current situation made us think even more about what VE Day actually meant.  “Although we’ve probably never been further apart from our loved ones, friends, family and neighbours, in some ways today made us realise that we’ve actually never been closer, and appreciate the le we have.” In Kenilworth, Warwickshire, Rusty “Grumpsy” Waughman, DFC, was out early chatting to youngsters helping prepare his street’s party. Rusty, , flew with  Squadron in the Battle of Berlin when few of the crews who went out came back. “Our squadron casualty rate went up to %,” he said. “You didn’t expect to survive, you just existed. “If you lost a comrade you used to go down to the mess and drink his health. But then you’d say ‘And here’s to the next one to die.’ Today is a day of remembrance for those of us who did survive.  “In  we marked the fact that the war in Europe was finished. “They kept the mess bar open so all the boys and girls drank the place dry. Then we walked to a pub and drank that dry too. So I can’t remember much after that! Today, sitting in my arm chair, I’ve been thinking of all the friends that aren’t here anymore. But then I come out here to see these wonderful new friends - these neighbours who have been such a help during this crisis.” Elsewhere, children chalked rainbows and soldiers on the pavement as tea tables were set up. In Trevis Road, Southsea, little Dylan Jeffrey, seven, proudly sported a Union Flag face painting while in Liverpool, Gabriella Gore, five, proudly showed off her evacuee-style dress, complete with address tag. In Cambrian Road, Chester residents really went to town, with everyone dressing up in s clothes.  Accordian player Matt Baker said: “We wanted to make this a really special day. After the trials of the last few weeks it’s a chance to let our hair down and pay tribute to the Second World War generation.” Some families popped inside to watch the BBC programme replaying Churchill’s pm victory speech. But others were just waiting for Dame Joan Collins to give us the thumbs up to pop the fizz. Instead she gave a Churchillian V sign from the balcony of her London home as she and husband Percy led the nation in a toast. Dame Joan, , said: “Let’s raise a glass and give a toast to the great heroes of World War Two. They gave so much to us, now we give thanks to them.”  She went on: “We must never forget the selflessness of all those who sacriced so much to keep us free, including all the courageous women who put their lives on the line for this nation’s struggle. “From their dangerous work as ARP air-raid wardens and ambulance drivers, as munitions factory-line workers, as code-breakers at Bletchley Park, as radar operators and plane spotters, as nurses and mechanics, the women of this country were an inspiration to women today. “I remember clearly coming home one morning, after spending the night in the Marble Arch underground during a particularly vicious raid, to find our block of flats had entirely disappeared and in its place, a pile of rubble. “I stared at the faces of the ARP rescue parties, their faces drawn and soot covered, who had dug frantically all night long for survivors while I, as a child, could only think about the fate of my favourite doll.”  In Bedfordshire the landlord of Captain Tom Moore’s local pub also raised a toast as other publicans rang the “time” bells in their empty bars.. All  houses on Trafalgar Terrace in Ystrad Rhondda, were decorated in bunting – some with rainbow patterns to recognise all key workers.

The th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe has been a bittersweet experience. The lockdown meant many veterans had to mark the occasion in solitude. This was also meant to have been a chance for nations once ided by war to come together to celebrate decades of peace and co-operation.

In its own way it has brought out the best in people whether that is the kindness shown by neighbours or the dedication of our NHS staff, carers and other key workers. During the war the watchwords of the Royal Family were never give up and never despair. They are as applicable now as they were then.

Lisa OaposMalley, , was subjected to the brutal attack by -year-old Jonathon Youthed after he ed home covered in blood and bragging about assaulting another man. Ms OaposMalley asked her partner to leave but he refused, and smashed her head on a coffee table and fish tank. The thug also punched her more than  times in the property in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Neighbours called  after hearing mum-of-one Ms OaposMalleyaposs screams during the sustained attack.

But it hasnapost stopped him bedding A-listers. Speaking about his famous conquests in the bedroom, Jonah said: Yes, Iaposve slept with celebrities including Oscar nominees and Oscar winners, but I canapost talk about that. Jonah, who is openly bisexual, said he couldnapost reveal whether the celebrities were men or women - but did confirm it wasnapost Meryl Streep. The -year-old also previously hit headlines when he caused a security alert at a US airport due to the bulge in his trousers.  Speaking previously about his manhood, he said: Itaposs handicapped my acting because people wonapost hire me. It sucks - it relegates me into doing smaller parts. Maybe in the UK or Germany it might help my acting career, but here in Hollywood itaposs a negative. He added: When Iaposm fully erect, Iaposm -and-a-half inches with a seven-and-a-half to eight inch diameter - itaposs thicker than my wrist. And when it comes to measuring up, Jonah claims to be nine inches when flaccid - compared to the average man who is around five to six inches when erect.  He said he first realised he was dferent at the age of around , when his schoolmates used to talk about him although he assumed it was because he had not been circumcised while his friends had. “I was eight inches at the time.” He said he had been offered porn work but had declined it: “I can’t perform in public - I’m a show off, but not doing it in front of other people.” Roberto Esquivel Cabrera, Saltillo, Mexico -I should be registered disabled  Roberto Esquivel Cabrera says the sheer size of his .inch manhood prevents him from working and has pleaded to be registered as disabled. He claims that firstly, he is unable to kneel down, and secondly, canapost wear a unorm because of its massive size. But while he got funding as a result of his aposdisabilityapos, the money is not enough, and he has in the past relied on food banks. Roberto made the headlines in  after a video went viral showing him weighing his member to prove its authenticity. He said: I cannot run fast and so the companies think badly of me. They say that they will call me, but they never do.  The government had initially dismissed his claims to be disabled but Roberto, from Saltillo, Mexico, now says it has been approved. He added: Every four months they give me some economic assistance but it is not enough. I visit the food banks every day to take my meals at  ‘o clock. He also previously told how women are too scared to have sex with him. He said: Look where it is, it goes far below the knees. But he added: I am famous because I have the biggest penis in the world.

At this point, the business wasnapost actually called Tesco - but he came up with the idea of Tesco Tea. Rather than naming the historical product after himself, he also wanted to include a nod to the tea suppliers - TE Stockwell. So, he took the TE and the S from them, and the CO from his own surname to form Tesco. Jack opened his first Tesco store in Burnt Oak, north London, in , which mainly sold affordable dry goods.  In  he took the next step towards keeping food affordable, and bought a plot of land so he could build a warehouse, the first in the country. This meant he had better control of stock, and could pass the savings on to his shoppers. He spent the next few years expanding his business, opening new stores across London.  When war broke out, Jack decide to introduce rationing at his stores before the government brought it in offically. He wanted to make sure that everyone could get enough to eat during the shortage, regardless of how much money they had. By , Jack had more  stores and opened his first supermarket, selling a range of products including cheese, meat and butter, in Maldon, Essex, in .  The first Tesco Superstore opened in Crawley in . It was massive compared to other stores, measuring , sq. ft. As well as food, it sold clothing and household items. Jack passed away in , leaving behind a huge company with hundreds of stores and thousands of employees. However his vision carried on, and in the  years since his death Tesco has continued to grow.

She added that she didnapost need to work as he paid for everything she needed, but was keen to stress it wasnapost a apossugar daddyapos type of relationship. When one person askedhe was a sugar daddy, she said nope not a sugar daddy cause heaposs younger than me. Sugar baby.  Surprisingly she was unwilling to reveal the identity of her younger lover, claiming that other women always seem to steal her men when she has announced them in the past. Margarita hit the headlines when she led police in a  minute chase, in a £, Mercedes, back in November . She appeared in court dressed in jewelled Gucci sunglasses, a Balmain dress worth £, and Christian Louboutin shoes.  She quickly became known as the aposMercedes Mumapos online before going on to use her profile to raise money to support her lestyle. At the time she claimed on a GoFundMe page that New South Wales Police were preventing her from getting a job. The mum-of-one wrote: I know you all don’t know me but Iaposm actually not a bad person.  These dogs are liars and have something against me for no reason as I’m sure I’m not the only one. They have made it very hard for me to maintain a job as no one would hire me due to the b******s from raptor and ACA combined. So I created this GoFund me to raise some support against the b******s that they have done to me and everyone . It’s about time we fight back. Enough is enough.  The court heard her three-year-old daughter was sobbing in the back seat following the terrying car ride. Police officers were horried to discover that the girl was sitting in an unrestrained car seat. At New South Wales District Court she was locked up for  months for the high speed chase. Her defence lawyer had claimed she had been under duress from Christopher King who sat beside her in the Mercedes.  He is such a large man that police officers needed two sets of handcuffs to restrain him, the court heard. Magistrate Susan McGowan rejected the lawyeraposs arguments and said: Would a reasonable person act as she did with a little girl in the back of the car  I don’t think they would.”  Police prosecutor Sergeant Amelia Wall told the court there was videos on  Instagram  of her car during the police chase.The lawyer added: Playing the victim on a GoFundMe page titled ‘Fight Raptor’ trying to raise , for her own use, all the while gloating on social media about spending thousands on clothing and accessories. “Reprehensible and deplorable.

Hopefully, when the time#s right and everybody is safe, we need to make sure we are ready to go.”Dundee have been heavily linked with afor striker Simon Murray, who is a free agent after leaving South African side Bidvest Wits last month, while a permanent move for St Johnstone midfielder Ross Callachan could also be on the cards.His loan spell at Dens was ended prematurely with a broken leg but impressed in his short time there and is out of contract in the summer.McPake has also never hidden his desire to see Hearts forward Craig Wighton back with the Dark Blues.The current concern for teams like Dundee in the lower isions, however, is how next campaign might look.The SPFL have begun a league reconstruction task force led by Hearts chair Ann Budge and Hamilton chief Les Gray to revamp the setup for the new campaign.Dens Park managing director John Nelms is part of the -strong reconstruction group but McPake admits he’ll be happy with whatever future is decided, as long as it benefits the game as a whole.He added: “My preferred option is that we just find a way to get something that works.“Look, we need to make sure everything is safe first.“Do I have a preferred option  I would love to be in the Premiership but we had a chance to do that ourselves this season and we failed.“If we had won the league, it would have been a given.“Butreconstruction happens, whatever way, I just hope they do it so that it suits the game going forward.“Would our input as managers help  But do we then ask players as well “It is a tough one. Do I want to be involved  No, I am happy to leave it to the powers-that-be and just concentrate on my job getting our squad ready so that when we do get the green light to go ahead we can do that.“I just want football back, I think society wants football back andreconstruction comes in then great.“But there are people out there risking their lives to save lives so they are the real important ones.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/04/5x3-940x564-1-620x372-1-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"rundstedt pulling out his panzers read how the tele reported ve day in this subscriber special replica edition articleisfree","story":"Europe has been marking the th anniversary of VE Day — when the second world war was declared over and Nazism defeated.To mark the occasion, we are reproducing the Tele from May  .To read how our paper reported the momentous news, browse our replica edition — available to our digital subscribers.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/05/john-a-1-934x564.jpg ","title":"senior dundee politicians discuss the possibility of pubs and football grounds reopening","story":"The leader of Dundee City Council and one of his SNP Westminster colleagues have both said people appear to be #happy# with the lockdown rules.John Alexander was joined by Dundee City East MP Stewart Hosie for a video chat with the Tele, with coronavirus the main talking point.There have been claims in the national press that there is an #impatience# or that, in some cases, people are breaking government rules and visiting friends.Last month, Nicola Sturgeon had discussed a scheme in which people could meet a small ‘bubble’ of others outside their own households.However, on May  she confirmed the strict lockdown rules would be continued for at least another three weeks. Council leader Mr Alexander said: “Locally, I’ve not heard of many instances at all where people have been breaking the rules, in terms of social distancing and other measures in place.“I’ve had a couple of issues raised with me by concerned constituents and I’ve relayed them as appropriate but I suppose, for the vast majority of people, they are adhering to all of that guidance that’s been issued as they understand the risk.“And it’s that word, it’s absolutely critical, a #risk#. Why would you want to take unnecessary risks that potentially not only put yourself in a position where you could contract Covid- but others too “I think people are taking that responsibility very seriously. I know certainly from neighbours, friends, etc, they are all taking it very seriously and making sure they follow the guidance to the letter.#Mr Hosie, who previously told the Tele that a premature lting or softening of the lockdown rules would be #a catastrophic mistake#, said: “Again this has all got to be driven by the R-number. All these ideas are in the mix for how the lockdown might end. But it’s all got to be driven by the transmission rate.“The idea of a small group of friends or a# bubble# you might be able to go and visit – these ideas have merit, but it’s all going to be driven by the R-number.“If the transmission rate goes down, and it stays down, and there’s little-or-no risk of it going back up again, then I’m sure all these ideas will be in the mix.“What we can’t do though, is say, ‘You can go and visit that family, and the next family and your pals down the road,’the R-number is still too high.”He added: I’m not picking up a lot of the so-called ‘impatience’ that appears to be on the front page of some of the tabloid newspapers.“I’m sure we’d all like to get out and do more things, I’m sure there are people who would like to get to the pub for a pint but right now this lockdown is here for a reason.“We know what the reason is it’s to stop the spread of this dreadful virus – lives are genuinely at stake – and I’m not picking up a huge impatience to end this until we’ve got this under control.#On Thursday it was announced Germany#s Bundesliga will resume football matches behind closed doors on May .So, are we likely to see theof matches at Dens Park, Tannadice or other sports at venues in Scotland, given that schools are #almost certainly# not going tofor pupils until after the summer Mr Hosie said: “I would love to get back to the football # I’d love to see the football .“But even a closed-door match you’ve got the teams, you’ve got the coaches, you’ve got the physios, you’ve got the security staff, you’ve got the drivers, you’ve got the media teams, which can be pretty enormous.“I’d love to find a way for this to happen, somehow. But I think the idea that there’s going to be lots of audience in football grounds and in our stadiums before the start of next season strikes me as highly unlikely.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-woman-discovered-first-human-coronavirus","story":" June Almeida, who discovered the first human coronavirus, was the daughter of a bus driver from Glasgow.

The UK Government has yet to confirm any precise details on what that might mean for places like garden centres.But Ms Sturgeon made it clear that there were no immediate plans for any such moves north of the border.Nicola Sturgeon said relaxing restrictions on outdoor exercise was the “only thing we are looking at in the immediate term”.Experts and officials were currently assessing the advice and the possibility of allowing people to go outdoors for exercise more than once a day, which is the current guidance.“Basically, the starting point is that what you are allowed to do once a day you will be allowed to do more than once,” she said.If you are not being allowed to do something in Scotland that you are allowed to do in other parts of the UK – or vice versa – it is because we judge here it is still necessary to save your lives.#Nicola SturgeonMs Sturgeon promised to update the public on exercise guidance over the weekend. Questioned about her refusal to go further, she said keeping garden centres closed for the time being would help save lives.“If you are not being allowed to do something in Scotland that you are allowed to do in other parts of the UK – or vice versa – it is because we judge here it is still necessary to save your lives… thatwe are asking you for a little bit longer not, for example, to go to garden centres,” the first minister said.Gordon Henderson of the Foxlane Garden Centre in Westhill, Aberdeenshire, warned the industry could be “devastated”the restrictions are kept in place. He said bills were coming in at a time when he would normally start selling bedding plants in a week or so.“If this goes on any longer than mid-May, it could be devastating for the horticultural trade up here,” Mr Henderson warned.“We were hearing rumours that garden centres were going to reopen on Monday. This whole thing, right from the start, has been an emotional roller-coaster. I can hardly blame Nicola for what she’s doing – lives are at stake here and that comes first. But there are livelihoods as well.”Appearing at the same briefing, Scotland’s most senior police officer, Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, admitted that dferent regulations across the UK would make policing “more challenging”.But he said he was “very confident” that Police Scotland would be able to cope.Ms Sturgeon also used the briefing to pay tribute to the wartime generation on the th anniversary of VE Day, saying that during the current crisis Scots could take inspiration from their sacrice for the greater good.“The challenge they made then is very dferent to the one we face today – we are not fighting a war,” Ms Sturgeon said.“But we should nonetheless draw strength and inspiration from their example.”The First Minister said people living through the Second World War showed the “necessity and value of personal sacrice”, “demonstrated the resilience of the human spirit” and “our ability to overcome adversity”.Ms Sturgeon concluded by saying: “Our challenge may be dferent but just as they did then, we will overcome it.”In addition to the death toll of ,, Ms Sturgeon reported that , people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by  from , the day before.There are  people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of two on Thursday, she added.There are , people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-, a decrease of three.Since March , , people who have tested positive for coronavirus have been able to leave hospital.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin.

Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

He said: ldquoI honestly donrsquot think I have ever read a fantasy novel!ldquoThat same literary agent, when she was trying to get a publisher for Snowball Oranges, told me detective novels were always popular.ldquoIrsquove never read one of those either and she said, lsquowell,you write one it will be original, evenit is rubbishrsquo.ldquoThat was the same attitude I took towards writing the fantasy novel.ldquoThe reaction so far has been quite encouraging.Peter was in popular s jazz band the Clyde Valley Stompers, who charted with Peter and The Wolf and were supported by The Beatles before the Fab Four made it big.Later, Peter produced more than  albums ndash including the Royal Scots Dragoon Guardsrsquo international chart-topper Amazing Grace ndash the biggest-selling instrumental of all time with  million sales.Thank you for reading this story.

We know local newsagents deliver to many people, but this short-term scheme will ensure that people who donrsquot get a delivery or who canrsquot afford a Courier are kept in touch. It is also important to support the Courier during this periodwe are to see it survive. Newspapers are essential for local democracy and the Courier regularly reports on issues we discuss at the council.One of the volunteers who deliver the newspaper is Susan Taylor ndash in her beloved Dolly CV which goes by the name of Myrtille.Susan, whose day job is working for the Church of Scotland as an executive assistant, is one of the team of resilience group volunteers picking up prescriptions for residents.ldquoI volunteered because I really feel for those people in our community who are at risk and isolated due to the Covid- outbreak, she said. ldquoI have met some lovely people so far and am glad I am in a position to help.The project is paid for through the townrsquos Community Emergency Resilience Fund ndash which comprises public donations, funding from North Berwick Community Council and the North Berwick Trust.Rotary Haddington was always looking for ways to support its community, said club president Malcolm Collins.ldquoOur idea to bulk-buy and distribute copies of the Courier to the elderly and vulnerable originated from one of our members who was quick to realise that a signicant number of such people would soon begin to feel isolated and lose touch with what was happening locallythey were unable to get out and buy a copy, he added.ldquoAs well as providing local news, the initiative shown by the Courier by including pages of extra puzzles in the paper was also thought to be useful to help keep folk entertained during these dficult times.ldquoWe have now taken this idea forward and arranged to bulk-buy copies of the Courier each week in advance, have them delivered to a central hub and then arranged for them to be distributed to other locations where they can be made available to those in need e.g. Our Community Kitchen, those in care homes and other locations as they become known to us.Rotary Haddington members would ensure that the papers were delivered where they were needed, he added.Courier Editor Robbie Scott said: ldquoWersquore so grateful to these groups for supporting our communities during lockdown and the amazing work they do inspires us to produce the best papers that we can.ldquoFor them to also directly support us at a dficult time for all businesses is incredible and we thank them immensely.Anyone wishing to buy copies of the Courier for delivery to communities should email rscott@eastlothiancourier.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig.

Suddenly, people have realised why there are borders and what governments are there for: it is to look after their own. It is all about safety. When it comes down to it, other countries cannot make le and death decisions for you.It was the principle applied by Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand when she decided that, actually, globalisation sucks and its better to look after your own people, eventhis means closing the borders to foreigners. Yesterday she said the borders would not be reopened ldquofor a long time.It applies especially to small countries because they are generally forgotten when the chips are down. However, in Scotland, there has been a widespread belief that the reverse has been the case and that the pandemic has ldquotorpedoed Scottish nationalism as a Scotsman headline put it recently.Commentators insist that the United Kingdom has been reunited, as in wartime. ldquoThe British family has come together to look after each other, opined a romantic unionist in the New Statesman. Im not sure theres much evidence for this.The pandemic could equally be said to have demonstrated the opposite: that it is irresponsible in a crisis to remain tied to the United Kingdom, and to the politics of British Conservatism which this country has consistently rejected. Scots are certainly not enthused by Boris Johnsons record so far. Yet three quarters believe Nicola Sturgeon has done a good job, according to the latest opinion poll.Personally, I am extremely uncomfortable with all the talk of borders, but I cant ignore the argument that, had it been in control of them, a Scottish government could have attempted the elimination strategy so effectively deployed in New Zealand. Instead, the UK government kept the borders open and some , travellers a day continued to enter Scotland with scarcely any checks.Opinion: Teddy Jamieson: Government needs to deliver more than gesturesThe influential Devi Sridhar, professor of Global Health at Edinburgh University, believes thatScotland had implemented border controls early a policy of intensive testing might well have worked here. The Scottish death rate has been around half the UK figure, and Prof Sridhar thinks it could have been halted altogether. Yet, in line with the UK, the Scottish Government abandoned community testing and contact tracing in mid-March.Now, I dont subscribe to the view that Boris Johnson has allowed thousands to die in order to save his billionaire Brexit chums. The UK government behaved reasonably, according to its lights, muddling through as always. But many mistakes were made and there is certainly an argument that Scotland could have handled the crisis better on its own.There still seems to be an assumption in the UK media that big countries are better at handling crises like coronavirus than smaller ones. Precisely the reverse appears to be the case ndash the biggest countries like America, UK, Italy, have had a dismal record in managing the pandemic so far.It is not only remote antipodean nations like New Zealand that seem to have fared better. The country with the lowest number of deaths per million in the EU is Slovakia, which has a population similar to Scotlands. The wearing of masks was made compulsory there early in the infection.Slovenia, which borders on Italy, has also emerged largely unscathed. Most small states like Norway and Denmark seem to have managed the disease effectively. The outlier is Belgium which has had the worst headline death rate so far, partly because of its population density, and perhaps because the country which houses the European Commission has been the most open and ldquoborder-free.The true death rate league table, as the risk guru Sir David Spiegelhalter has pointed out, cannot be known until the pandemic is over. But there is pretty strong evidence that smaller countries do well. They seem able to move and adapt more quickly. They also tend to be more united and able to reach a rapid consensus.Of course, unionists have always insisted that, Covid aside, an independent Scotland would be too poor and dependent on UK subsidies to survive. It would certainly start le with a budget deficit. Butthe pandemic has shown anything it is that large deficits can be managed. Theyll have to be, because every country is now in the same boat.There was never any sound economic reason why Scotland should be any less able to manage its affairs than countries like Denmark or Norway. Nationalism is about security not economics.Anyway, in the bounce-back, assuming that it happens, Scotland will again find itself tied to policies that it doesnt choose, which may include another wave of Conservative austerity. The Westminster government will naturally look to London and the North of England, where its votes lie. They will be first in the queue for investment.This isnt out of malice, but simply because Scotland is another country. It seems blindingly obvious that we are entering an age in which voters and their governments are more nation-conscious than ever. Not in a spirit of xenophobic exceptionalism but out of practical necessity. They are nearer to the people and to their pain.Of course, independence is not coming tomorrow or the next day. There wont be a referendum in the near future, for obvious reasons. But after Covid, Scotland will continue to demand greater control over its own affairs. It will increasingly behave as an independent country, even though it is bound economically to the UK. If and when the next phase of Covid arrives, Scotland will not be following a policy dictated by Westminster.I think the voters are actually ahead of the politicians on this, and ahead perhaps of Nicola Sturgeon, who has been reluctant to appear to exploit this crisis for political ends. That is to be commended. There would always have to be cooperation between Scotland and England. But far from reviving the United Kingdom as a going concern, this pandemic could be the final nail in its coffin.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Premium shellfish ndashbrown crab to China, scallops to Italy, langoustines to Spain ndash has also been despatched abroad as soon as it was landed.Once these exports, and the chefsrsquo orders, were syphoned off, that left many retail fishmongersrsquo slabs selling a predictable choice, heavily reliant on familiar species, notably haddock, padded out with farmed fish. Enter coronavirus. Restaurant orders stopped overnight, export chains broke down. But instead of tying up boats and facing financial ruin, some determined fishermen, operating smaller boats closer to shore, have started exploring local markets, on the quayside, via direct boat-to-door home deliveries, or at the fishmongers.As Nick Underdown, campaigner at Open Seas, the charity that promotes sustainable alternatives to damaging fishing, puts it: ldquoSome of our tremendous, sustainably caught seafood that was previously shipped abroad is now actually available. Hurrah!Itrsquos heartening to see our seafood supply chain localising, but what happened to species ersity  In Cornwall and Devon fishermen are concentrating on the local market too, and they are lucky to have an abundance of fish available from smaller boats: lemon sole, cod, plaice, hake, megrim, turbot, as well as shellfish. Scotlandrsquos fleet, on the other hand, has become highly reliant on monocultures, for example scallops dredged asploughing a field, which destroys the breeding grounds for other fish.Efforts are being made to make these fisheries more selective, but unfortunately some fisheries still net huge amounts of ldquobycatch, and often very small fish, meaning that young fish never get the chance to grow and breed. A further issue is that many fisheries around Scottish shores have not recovered from decades of overfishing. For instance, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recommends that there is lsquono catchrsquo of cod on the west coast. Other sources insist that there are viable cod fisheries in the North Sea. Some fishmongers sell this catch, supplied predominantly from bigger boats that land direct to our whitefish port hubs: Peterhead, Fraserburgh, and to a lesser degree Scrabster, Lochinver, and Kinlochbervie.Here are some fishmongers, local cooperatives, and small commercial operators doing local sales.I canrsquot vouch for the sustainability credentials of all their products. Many sell the ubiquitous farmed salmon, and dredged scallops. There are few unambiguously local and sustainable sources as yet.But now that coronavirus has depth-charged our fishermen, they need our support.

No community deserves this tag and for a day or so these streets piqued the curiosity of the media caravan before it moved on to feed on the misfortunes of some other benighted place.Our new friend is in trouble and perhaps sees in the councillor something solid and reliable.

He seems more relaxed now and says that we are a pair of ldquogood c**ts. As the taxi arrives he asks uswersquore behaving ourselves and, with a twinkle in his eye, entreats us to look after ourselves. He has started our encounter four goals down but he wonrsquot be defeated.This is Greenock Central, which was ranked top of the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivationearlier this year. This table measures income, health, employment, education, housing, crime and access to services. It took the title from Ferguslie Park in Paisley which was named third most deprived this time. The statistics are well-intentioned and designed to inform all the concerned agencies about spending decisions and service priorities across , small postcode areas called \"data zones\". Yet, every four years when the latest winners and losers are revealed the names at the top and bottom remain largely the same.Mere statistics, though, can never form a complete picture of a neighbourhoodrsquos worth and needs. We all form pictures of what a community rated Scotlandrsquos most deprived ought to look like and this part of Greenock doesnrsquot really fit. Councillor McEleny says: ldquoWersquove got a high population of pensioners here, and many of them have been living in poor health for maybe the last  years or so of their lives.He points to a homeless centre standing between the town and the water. ldquoThis place lies at the heart of the data zone and contributes to the statistics. You donrsquot see places like this in Stockbridge or Bearsden. Yoursquove got people in there whose needs are numbered in multiple strands of deprivation. They get into patterns of behaviour at a very early age when they leave school and find there are no jobs. That place is a monument to the failure of society. You canrsquot just keep throwing pound after pound at fire-fighting. You have to have early intervention and prevention. In many of these cases though, the time for early intervention has probably come and gone.Councillor McEleny is a well-kent figure on these streets and our walk is punctuated by local people stopping to chat and say hello. Soon, we reach the glass-roofed shopping centre that sits at the heart of the town and the councillor becomes animated in his disdain for it. ldquoThis whole area was a handsome and open place with green spaces. As a child I walked through here on my way to the other side of town or down to the waterfront.ldquoSadly, the stock solution favoured by planners in places struggling with de-industrialisation and de-population was to get more retail spaces under one big roof. Itrsquos a  economy. Many of the units were quickly occupied by chain-stores and coffee-shop franchises which replaced local shops, unable to compete with their prices. Thus, money was sucked away from the town and into the pockets of distant shareholders.ldquoThis is why Irsquom passionate about politics: this is where support comes from. We have a budget of poundm in Inverclyde but people want their good roads and their leisure facilities. When they see you spending money on things that only seem to benefit a minority they get disgruntled. This is the test of a decent society: how much are we willing to help those on the bottom rung Alan Coyle is the principal teacher in Pastoral Support at St Matthewrsquos Academy in Greenock and observes the challenges encountered by his pupils and their little victories each day of his working le. He says. ldquoItrsquos easy to be negative and hark back to the old days of busy shipyards and full employment. I think itrsquos remarkable that the area of the town which has emerged as the most deprived is pretty much its commercial centre. This is testament, I think, to the way this area has been decimated due to poor governance.ldquoBut local people are very protective of it and proud of its heritage, but they are also very aware of the challenges it faces. However, you canrsquot discuss Greenock without placing it in the context of Inverclyde as a whole. When I taught Modern Studies we used to talk about the paradox of Drumchapel and Bearsden separated by only a few hundred metres. Here, we have an equally striking dichotomy between Kilmacolm and the east end of Greenock. The gap between the most and least affluent in Inverclyde is the same as it is in any number of towns across central Scotland.:Giovanna Eusebi shares memories of cooking with her grandmother in lockdown recipe seriesldquoOnce, we had the great industrial actions of the s and s and the Lee Jeans work-in. And we fans of Greenock Morton FC take enormous pride in the fact that when it came to the crunch, we fought to keep our club back in . The local community support came to the fore then. But I dont think that feeling is there anymore.A DISTANCE of  miles separates Greenock from the stately arrondissement of Stockbridge, north of Edinburgh city centre, but it may as well be a dferent planet. This opulent little village was rated the least deprived corner of Scotland in the SIMD table, although it seems bizarre to include a word like lsquodeprivedrsquo anywhere near this neighbourhood.Those who donrsquot know Edinburgh are inclined to describe it as a posh city, but itrsquos not really. Refined: maybe reserved: perhaps, but Edinburgh too has its edgy places. Stockbridge though, is a Brigadoon version of Edinburgh that you happen upon after a long walk down from Princes Street, not noticing it until yoursquore actually in it. Here, the pace of le seems to slow and yoursquore invited to leave your baggage at the side of the Water of Leith. Itrsquos an enchanting place that beckons you to linger a little and chill for a while. Running alongside it is an aptly-named district called Comely Bank.In public buildings and dwelling places are the obvious dferences between affluence and penury but you sense these too in the way that people carry themselves. In poor streets there is a sense of people needing to be somewhere soon ever-alert for some invisible threat. In places like Stockbridge they move with the languor thatrsquos the preserve of those who measure their plans in years not days.Today, I encounter Stockbridge in the middle of coronavirus lockdown but you canrsquot help wonderingmuch has changed with the social restrictions. The usual middle class caprices of cobbled streets and the neighbourhood watch are here. Not for the first time I wonder why such genteel vigilantism is only seen in those communities that least require it.Where there are betting shops in Greenock here there are little shrines to interior design selling bespoke kitchens and luxury lights. Next door to a bakerycalled Pattiserie Florentin there is a shop which sells something called a ldquoSublime Replenishing Night Masque, which in Greenock might equate to a facial. Across the road stands an ample shop-front calls itself a lsquoFloatariumrsquo which I initially took to mean a shop specialising in inflatable paddling pools. On closer inspection though, there was a dizzying and esoteric assortment of treatments some of which, like manicures and pedicures Irsquod heard of and others such as a Lash Bar and the eponymous Floatarium that toyed with my imagination. You could go your holidays here.Judging by the number of charity shops here Stockbridge seems to have a big heart too. These though wouldnrsquot be called charity shops anywhere  but luxury goods emporiums. The estate agents advertise properties in the poundk to poundk price range in Greenock Central there are decent two-bedroom flats available for poundk. Just over there is a gallery called lsquoDoubtfirersquo. Only in a place such as this would such a name not be considered comically ironic. In the Water of Leith underneath the old bridge stands one of Anthony Gormleyrsquos sculptures. In the streets around it I counted eight interiors shops and five art-shops. They donrsquot just have delicatessens here they have epicures, which are not to be confused with the products on offer at the Floatarium.A lady with a Jane Austen accent calls to me across the road. ldquoItrsquos all very weird, she shouts, smiling. ldquoBut the wine-shop is open and Irsquove managed to get a chocolate brownie. These are essential items in a Stockbridge residentrsquos shopping basket.Maggie Lennon, director of the Bridges Programme charity and now resident of Glasgow, recalls her years living in Stockbridge fondly. ldquoThere was always something thrilling yet comforting walking down those steep hills from the new town to Stockbridge, she says. Itrsquos where, she says, the regimented streets and thoroughfares of the New Town succumbed to the anarchy of the twisted and meandering lanes of the village. ldquoI always considered Stockbridge to be hip.ldquoAnd I loved the restaurants, bistros, wholefoods and wine bars. Maison Hector was famous for the wall of running water cascading down the wall in the gentsrsquo loo. This was a design feature. We even had a cricket ground to which the Lord Taverners turned up once a year for a charity match and a ball. If you got tickets for this you knew you had made something of yourself.BACK IN GREENOCK they choose not to be resentful at such apparent inequality in the space of an hourrsquos drive in an affluent country. Councillor McEleny points to the townrsquos own handsome places. Just a few hundred metres separate the benighted town centre from the redeveloped waterfront seafront and the splendid Beacon Arts Centre.

Instead he points to missed opportunities at a local level and a chronic lack of imagination and aversion to risk at a national level.ldquoWhen the shipyards began to close and the jobs began to disappear there was little thought given to what should happen next, he said. ldquoUnfortunately, Greenock encountered a perfect storm of circumstances all converging at the same time. Councils and governments were desperate for jobs and, in their panic, they invited the multinational supermarkets in with open arms.ldquoThe local producers all disappeared to be replaced by low-paid jobs contributing [less] to the long-term health of the local economy. Choices made nationally have also had an effect. Therersquos no thinking outside the box.ldquoCities have the tools to meet economic challenges. They will always attract finance and have a lucrative retail and night-time economy. The power of the public sector should have been better used in areas like this.

We need to make sure the SNP is the party of that radical change.ldquoWe exist to win independence for Scotland not for the sake of it but to make sure that the vital decisions about how we run our economy and our society are taken closer to home so that we can do things dferently and better.ldquoThis means that despite the current crisis, work should be continuing apace within our party on policy development and strategic direction.Her comments follow a YouGov poll published last week that suggested the SNP is on track for a majority at next yearrsquos Holyrood election.The survey of  Scots found  per cent plan to give their first vote to the party in the election next spring, while % would pick them for the regional vote.Ballot Box Scotland said this would result in the party taking  seats, an increase of five from the last election.Meanwhile, a Panelbase poll commissioned by the pro-independence blog Wings Over Scotland found Scots are ided - on the issue of independence.Nicola Sturgeon previously abandoned her plan to have a second independence referendum this year because of coronavirus.Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell said the SNP administration had ldquopaused work on preparing for Indyref in late  and would focus its resources on coping with the health crisis instead.ldquoIt follows from this that a referendum will not take place this year, he said."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11347005.jpg?type=article-full","title":"ve-day-75-memories-unite-lockdown-scotland","story":"Also at pm, thousands of people will stand up and raise a toast: ldquoTo those who gave so much, we thank you.It wasnrsquot supposed to be this way though.Camleys Cartoon: VE Day .There were supposed to be church services and public parades and street parties. But then lockdown happened and the plans to mark the th anniversary of VE Day had to be changed. Now, we will remember on our own, or in small groups, or online.But we will still remember.There will be mixed emotions, just as there were for those who were actually there. Veterans like Catherine Drummond, a former WAAF from Bridge of Allan, who was a -year-old war widow and young mother when VE Day happened.Now , she says she was sad on the day but thankful for all the men and women who were coming home.Or Frank Coyle, from Govan, who was one of the people who had to keep on fighting after VE Day ndash the war in Japan didnrsquot end until August .Now , Mr Coyle found it tough going when he got back home and he struggled to find work, as did many others. Britain was bankrupt and rationing didnrsquot end until the s.Or William Paton from Stoneyburn in West Lothian. He kept a diary in which he recorded his experiences of VE Day and the joy he felt.ldquoI heard Prime Minister Churchill speaking on the wireless at pm, he wrote.ldquoHe announced the war with Germany was over. It was a day of great rejoicing. In Stoneyburn, bonfires were lit in every street and crowds gathered round them and sang into the wee sma hours.There were similar scenes all over Scotland. In Perth, the bells of the churches began to peel immediately after Churchillrsquos broadcast.In Falkirk, a pipe band paraded through the town. And in Greenock, there was singing and dancing in the streets.But the biggest party was in Glasgow. Crowds flowed in and out of George Square from pm until well after midnight. Many danced in front of the City Chambers.Fireworks were let off. Children and soldiers climbed on the statues. The pubs had to close early because there was no more beer left, but the party went on anyway.Reporting on the celebrations, The Glasgow Herald called it a robust and joyful night.ldquoNoise, the sort of gay, grappling, carefree merry making, the sound of which has not been heard of in Glasgow in the s, came back to town, said the report.ldquoYou could hear it half a mile away. It was solid and heartwarming.ldquoA party of able seamen took the notion to ride bareback on one of the equestrian statues in George Square. They contented themselves with hanging on to the stirrups when it was pointed out to them that their combined weight might topple horse and rider from the pedestal. Later they achieved their ambition and got astride the bronze horse.The Herald also reported how a Dutch sailor climbed on top of the statue that would later become famous as a resting place for traffic cones ndash the Duke of Wellington statue in Royal Exchange Square ndash and did an impersonation of Hitler.ldquoAn admiring crowd applauded his buffoonery, said The Herald.ldquoIt was equally responsive when he made a short speech in broken English and thanked ldquothe Scots for the brave part they had played in the liberation of his country.In London, the celebrations were on an even bigger scale. Some , people gathered at Buckingham Palace to see the first of several balcony appearances by the King and Queen and princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. Famously, the princesses later slipped out and mingled anonymously with the people.At pm, pretty much everything stopped for Churchillrsquos speech to the nation and it was a warning just as much as it was a celebration.ldquoWe may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, he said, ldquobut let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead. We must now devote all our strength and resources to the completion of our task, both at home and abroad.Historian Derek Patrick, who lectures in history at St Andrews University, says it is important to remember Churchillrsquos words and that in many ways VE Day represented a continuation rather than a change.ldquoRealistically, there was no sea change ndash nothing changed overnight, said Mr Patrick.ldquoYou would start to see POWs ing to the country but it took a long long time to get things back on an even keel and towards normality.ldquoThere was also a level of hostility and resentment ndash a feeling that people were promised a land fit for heroes but it was a  dawn. After years of war, there was perhaps a determination to see this project through and you can attribute a lot of the changes we saw after VE Day, like the NHS, to the war. This is a moment to rejoice ndash Europe has been pulled back from the precipice ndash but this is only one step on the road to victory.Catherine Drummond certainly remembers how tough it was after VE Day. She was a war widow with an eight-month-old daughter and had to work two jobs, in a shop and waiting tables, to make ends meet. She was also still mourning her husband.ldquoIt took me a long time to get over it, she said. ldquoI didnrsquot really give up hope until the POWs came home. I was hoping, you know.Like everyone , Mrs Drummond is now in lockdown, but Poppy Scotland is encouraging people to mark VE Day at home or use the subject as a resource for home schooling.You can also download bunting from Poppy Scotlandrsquos website for a Zoom party, or use their recipes to make some of the food, like potato shortbread, that would have been eaten at street parties  years ago.There are other events today you can take part in even in lockdown. At am there will be a two-minute silence, which will be broadcast on the BBC.At pm people will be encouraged to take part in the Nationrsquos Toast. Then, at pm, the Queen,  years after making her way incognito through the crowds in London, will address the nation.Mr Patrick said it was important to mark VE Day in this way, not just through any sense of celebrating the victory ndash although that is important ndash but also to remember what the country went through.The war had gone on for six years. Scotland had been subjected to  German air raids. Homes and families were destroyed. And widows and widowers were made. The country was exhausted and the political, social and economic repercussions would be felt for many years to come.But perhaps, says Mr Patrick, it is even more important to mark this anniversary than the ones that have gone before ndash for a simple and poignant reason. ldquoThe opportunities to speak to the people who were there, he says, ldquoare slipping away."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-elon-musk-case-much-milk","story":"YESTERDAY we ran a story proving that the messages academics scrawl on walls can be just as smart as anything they write on a blackboard.

The First Minister has mostly managed to strike the right tone from the beginning when she said the virus was a reminder that in a crisis, the issues that ide us are no longer quite so important.Her briefing this week, following leaks to the media by the UK government on plans to be announced by Boris Johnson tomorrow on easing lockdown, was an impressive performance. Ms Sturgeon said she was open to relaxing some rules on exercising outdoors, but warned it could be catastrophic to drop the ldquostay at home message. The firm tone was well judged given the mooted ergence on the current pan-UK strategy it was not an exaggeration, said Ms Sturgeon, that the decisions taken now were a matter of le and death.A precipitate exit from lockdown risks triggering a rise in cases. As the FM said: extreme caution is required.Ms Sturgeonrsquos refusal to openly criticise the PM or the UK Government even though she had not been briefed on the plans they leaked to the media was to her credit. Some have accused her of trying to draw dferences between Edinburgh and London for political purposes, but in fact the whole of the UK went into lockdown together and, by and large, the governments have worked in tandem. This is no time for a constitutional bun-fight.In urging caution over lockdown, Ms Sturgeon has also proved herself politically astute. Over the last few days, we have seen aof some of the PMrsquos bullish enthusiasm ndash some of the lockdown measures could start to be lted from Monday, he said. Hawkish Tories are also suggesting a quick easing of restrictions.In urging caution, Ms Sturgeon has made any rush towards an ease of lockdown much more dficult she has also emphasised how poorly the UK Government is handling this latest stage of the information campaign. The leaks that suggested we might soon be allowed to go to the park or the beach to sunbathe or have a picnic betrayed a disgraceful lack of discipline within the UK Government. Unlike the ldquostay at home message, the leaks are also likely to cause confusion among the public.It is signicant that, after Ms Sturgeonrsquos briefing, the UK Government started to dial down on the rhetoric. Hopefully, they understand that pushing a policy without appearing to properly consult the devolved administrations shows a lack of respect for devolution.A spokesperson for the PM also reiterated that he was committed to a UK-wide approach, although both the PM and the FM have said it is possible the four nations may go dferent waysthey are at dferent stages.Such a multi-speed approach could be entirely logical. Coronavirus can behave dferently in dferent countries and can y within countries, which means there could be good reasons for dferences in the response across the UK. What it must not mean, though, is that we start to confuse the message on coronavirus. If we are all in this together, we all need clear, careful and consistent advice.Why we rememberOn May th, , people across Britain celebrated VE Day communally. Seventy-five years on, because of coronavirus, we are forced to mark the anniversary in a dferent way. But we can still remember. Some people worry about vainglory, but really itrsquos about stopping to think about the extraordinary endurance of the men and women who belonged to the war generation. The ones who were killed. The ones who became widows and widowers and orphans. The ones who thought it would never end. Seventy-five years ago, they celebrated the end of it all but they also mourned. We can do the same."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-kevin-mckenna-must-put-people-profit","story":"I spoke recently to a secondary head-teacher who told me that his school ndash and many others ndash are preparing for serious challenges in dealing with the mental and physical impact of coronavirus on his pupils. This, he suggested, will last for many years. Several health professionals have told me that the long-term psychological damage of coronavirus on iniduals and families is what you might associate with surviving a war. Anyone who thinks wersquoll be meeting lsquonormalityrsquo any time soon is deluding himself.Schools, especially those with a high quotient of disadvantaged pupils, will be required to provide a full suite of social services. To an extent, this had always been part of their duty of care. In the years ahead though, this will become their primary . At this stage we canrsquot easily put a figure on the number of children affected by parents losing their jobs or struggling with overwhelming debt. The word lsquounprecedentedrsquo is now the most common in the pandemic lexicon and it fits here too. And we can only guess at what other iniquities many children will have been forced to witness.Itrsquos almost unbearable to imagine what terrors many women and children are currently experiencing. Last week, Karen Ingala Smith, chief executive of domestic abuse charity, Nia, reported that domestic violence killings have more than doubled during the lockdown. Ms Ingala Smith has been monitoring the numbers of women killed by men in the UK for an annual femicide census and has identied at least  suspected domestic abuse killings occurring between March  and April .Ms Ingala Smith said the number of women killed by men in the first three weeks of lockdown is the highest for  years. We also know the communities in which this apocalypse is most prevalent. According to the Scottish Governmentrsquos latest statistics, these places are seeing coronavirus death rates three times worse than in affluent neighbourhoods.After lockdown, as society hurries to re-locate order, the money-changers will be found at the head of the throng. Yet,the countrys primary focus is on the recovery of its people then corporations and commerce police and judiciary must also be encouraged to change dramatically the way they go about their business. To borrow another locution from the coronavirus glossary, this should happen in lsquolocksteprsquo with the programme of welfare that will be requiredwe are serious about the post-pandemic recovery.Weve all warmed to the acts of kindness and compassion which have made the lockdown more bearable. The true worth of our claims to be a lsquodecentrsquo country fit for heroes will lie in how our civic authorities and our corporate giants treat people.The Government was very quick to create emergency legislation to provide an aid package to preserve jobs. Something similar must be enacted to ensure large companies with big profits dont hide behind coronavirus to dispense with their workers. This perhaps will be an early test of Keir Starmerrsquos credentials to lead the Labour Party. Following the  banking crisis countless large companies treated their employees as mere collateral damage. It didnrsquot matter that their huge profits would soon recover in time in the short term the ravenous demands of their shareholders had to prevail.Greenock and Stockbridge: A tale of two Scotlands under coronavirusThe Royal Bank of Scotlandwas considered by the UK Government to be too big to fail and public cash was found to save it. It repaid the nationrsquos largesse by establishing its Global Restructuring Group to locate and hunt down small and medium-sized businesses menace them into liquidation and then gorge themselves on the assets for a song. It was a scandal.In pre-coronavirus times large firms who felt pressured into morality would blackmail the country by warning us thattoo many regulations and controls were imposed on them theyd have to up sticks and relocate where. Aye, well good luck to themthey attempt to pull that one now...In times of crisis we are all urged to pull together and channel our inner Dunkirk. We all fall in quickly. It soon emerges, though, that the new rules rarely apply to the corporate world. In the US those banks tasked with disbursing cash intended to relieve small businesses chose instead to favour their large corporate clients. The relief programme was intended to give emergency loans to firms as an inducement to businesses not to ditch their employees. It ran out of money last week because the larger firms were served first. More than  of these firms, some with market values of more than  million, received a combined million in loans.We saw something of this last month in the UK as multi-million-pound firms with massive profits moved with remarkable haste to avail themselves of the Government furlough scheme. This money tree canrsquot maintain such windfalls indefinitely. A time will come when the Government must move to protect the employees when the directors revert to their base instincts.We too easily swallow the pernicious fiction of capital that entrepreneurs are our sole wealth-providers. In this wersquore told that they live to provide jobs from the wells of goodness that spring in their saintly hearts. Aye, right. The reality is thatmany of them could find a way of amassing profits without having to use workers at all theyrsquod regard it as the golden ticket.In the years ahead we will be urged to alter our behaviours and to get with the new reality. This must apply to the corporations too. They must be made to assist in the national recovery programme by putting people at the heart of their enterprises before profits. In time, their bonuses can . Meanwhile, they can be parked in the same way that many others have parked their wellbeing to keep this countryrsquos lights on.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He’ll appreciate that we put the testing website together at a remarkable pace and so in the first iteration weren’t able to make this sort of important nuance for Orkney and island communities, but I’ll take that away and look at it.“He mentioned the answer to this in substance and the answer is to get the home testing kits working for Orkney [and Shetland] and I’m sure there’s a way through.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“I am glad that action will be taken to get this issue sorted.

The government’s eventual decision to bow to our pressure and pass this money on is a signicant victory for local government.“Much more support is needed for local services from the Scottish Government though. There is more funding that should be available to us and we will continue to fight for that. Local councils are facing unprecedented dficulties. The costs of providing key services is rising and yet our income is dropping – an effect of the current crisis is being felt keenly in Orkney.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Billions of pounds worth of gas from Shetland#s Laggan-Tormore Shetland Gas Plant complex pass through Shetland for consumption, where. It is a monstrous scandal that not a single molecule of that is made available to Shetland homes and businesses.Responsibility lies firmly at the door of the SIC. In the interest of their renewable energy hobby horse, for years, they have done nothing to secure incredibly cheap gas supplies for local people and left no stone unturned in their lobbying for Viking Energy. Of course, cheap gas for power generation, homes and businesses would kill the chances of UK consumers paying £. billion for a subsea transmission link to transport unreliable, expensive renewable energy the + miles to SE England, where demand is located.And the result  The devastation of the Unesco Shetland Global Geopark, lauded for its hitherto pristine environment.I#m a stakeholder # and I welcome the opportunity to be consulted. However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting. What more could one ask for in this struggling , changed 🌎 world we occupy for a short time. Now Thorium nuclear is clean, no long half-le isotopes produced and no danger of meltdown.They are also neither cheap or reliable. Back up will also be requiredfor when the sun doesn#t shine or the wind isn#t suitable at more expense. More renewables will inevitably contribute to increased fuel poverty.Michael Moore # Planet of the Humans # a documentaryon the renewable energy scam that the left want banned # who would have thought !The more you look into the problem of energy supply against saving the environment, the more contradictory conclusion one gains. Wind and Solar maybe cleaner, but how much land and natural habitat being destroyedwould be required to power a city of several million##.and this is just  city     What energy source would be required alsothere are days of no sun or no wind. What backup technology would be in place, and would this also be clean energy  It seems ironically disturbing that cleaner energy through wind and solar, would also have a negative impact on the environmentyou take into consideration the polluting processes involved in the manufacturing of such devices.as well as the huge amount of land required , which would also be expanding as the population grows. I would assess cleaner energy via wind and solar would have a larger impact on the natural eco-systems and the environment and would still be reliant on fossil fuels. As far as I can see, disturbing as it may be, the only source for future energy demand is to go nuclear.And no , I am not a pessimistI’m a wary realist.Better than a blinkered optimist.Nuclear Energy does have its dangerous pitfalls, but we are already using this technology to generate electricity. I believe % of our electricity is produced by nuclear power  In France I believe this to be much higher  Although it may be dficult to assess the impact of solar or wind generators on the environment on a large scale, it would have to be balanced between the use of such technology to this of the environmental and eco-systems which maybe affected.I do not know how much land would be required to provide electricity to a city of several million, but I would hazard a guess it would be quite considerable  This use would also have to compete with farming and agriculture not to mention living space for housing etc etc.  from the shore would these wind turbines be  I suspect it would be quite close  Will our seashores be lined up with thousands of wind turbines I would also suspect the cost of such a scenario would be very high in adoption and maintenance.lol Hayden. Disturbing as it may be, I do not think we will have much option but to go nuclear. If it were a case of saving the environment and eco-systems, one may not have any choice We are already using this technology to produce electricity, andit is the case of minimizing our impact on the environment and eco-systems, then nuclear maybe the only way Cleaner energy may be, morally, more suited, but one must also take into consideration the impact on the environment and eco-systems and how this may change towards a negative once we realize the full influence of this compared to the potential benefits I cannot give any answers to what a large scale wind or solar scheme would be to power several millions homes, but I would suspect it would be considerably large in land area  One could use the same land for agriculture and farming and possibly housing  Shetland is suited for wind generating power schemes, but what would be the benefits to this of tourism, bird populations and property values, not to mention the visual impact of those people living near to such schemes and the consistent vibrating noise.Agriculture, farming and housing would not be adversely affected. Bird populations would be safe and tourists would be able to concentrate on spending their money which, after all, is the main reason for encouraging them to visit Shetland!! By the way,I have stood close to wind fed generators of the type we are discussing and never felt vibrations —- just the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades. Not too dferent from the soothing sounds of the sea.Haydn, You live in Crickhowell, Wales, nowhere near any large windfarms.The Black Mountains and the Brecon Beacons on your doorstep. Just how close is your home to the #the pleasant swishing sound of the rotating blades  .# I really doubtyou can even see a -meter turbine from your home. On Shetland people would be living under them, they would be about  meters high on high hills  meters or so plus above our heads!!! The plan is for over.Another smaller series of wind turbines is even closer to me and they are sited near Ebbw Vale on The Tops as we in the lower valley area call them. From close first hand experience I still maintain that the swishing sound of the blades is pleasant and certainly not as fierce and noisyas anyof the many gale force winds on Shetland.Or does that apply just to those who are incomers from other places like England for example Where do you hale from Ian  Just wondering !Llanfoist is just a walk from Crickhowell, I walk that distance most days!!! !! As you asked, for what it is worth, I have lived in Shetland  years now, longer than anywhere . Just the relevance of that is a bit beyond me but it seems you wish to know!!Ian, since I don’t live in Crug Hywel , a walk from where I do liveand back would be  miles. In my marathon running days that would have been a decent evening run but those days have gone. A short walk of  miles would be easier now.Ian, you did a Trump special and answered a query I did not make. I did not ask you how long you’ve lived on Shetland. My question was where do you hail from Haydn, I wrote rotor noise, not Chinook engine noise. Do not put words in my mouth. Now close up in a gale the continuous noise compares to engine noise fo a jet engine, I believe Chinooks are turbojet-powered. Now your  Ferndale turbines are tiny compared to the Shetland proposed -meter monsters. Less than half the rotor spread and about one-twentieth the number, not  miles away but on top of us..Isn#t it the case that so-called #infrasound#, noise at frequencies too low to be heard by humans, is what reportedly causes stress and illness in humans and other animals  The sort of thing they use in movies to create feelings of unease, etc. You can often feel it but not hear it.Personally, it is not the sound noise that particularly concerns me but the complete destruction of a unique landscape and rare ecosystem. The peat hills of Shetland are as rare special as the Amazon rain forest. Hectare for hectare the peat stores more carbon than a rainforest, tens of thousands of tons of concrete a hundred miles or so of new roads all over the high hill! Then several dozen hectares of quarrying and thousands of tons of broken rock all taken from a very unique landscape. The breeding ground of the very rarest of birds, animals and SSSIs desecrated all to make a very few people richer. Seven hundred and fty-odd million Pounds on copper and plastic cable alone. The stuff of real nightmares!!!As I’ve said before, all the negatives can be resolved at a stroke.By the way, where do you hail from  Don’t be shy or ashamed and stop being so secretive. this is Britain not North Korea !!.."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown collaboration offers shetland mum a birthday surprise to treasure ","story":"A Shetland mum enjoyed the #best birthday present ever# after her four children collaborated to record her a special song # despite being separated by the Covid- lockdown.Anna Forbes said the song offered moments to treasure during a time when the family have been unable to see each other., in reference to Anna#s regular Facebook posts of her windowsill overlooking Whiteness Voe, the song was recorded over several days ahead of her birthday on th April.It features her son, Dan Ralph, and three daughters Chloe, Gemma and Abbie, all of whom grew up in Shetland, after Anna moved here in  as a single mum.The three daughters married Shetland boys and all Anna#s children now have young families of their own.Anna, who is married to Mike Forbes, said the song reflected their #sometimes chaotic childhood# and how they now realise what it is like to be parents.#They have added humour, which made me laugh and cry simultaneously,# she added.#It was a lovely surprise.#Dan Ralph, who now lives in Wales with his we Anna and their young daughter, plays guitar and sings on the song, which he wrote and co-ordinated.Chloe, who still lives in Shetland with her husband Jonathan Kerr and their three children, plays flute.Gemma, who is a paediatric nurse and now lives near Edinburgh with her husband Richard Bulter and their two children adds vocals, along with Abbie who lives in Bo#ness with her husband Andrew Watt and their young son.Anna said the song was put together in just few days, despite living so far from each other.#A great example of lockdown creativity,# she added. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"carmichael calls on pm to be guided by science over coronavirus ","story":"Criticism has been levelled against Boris Johnson’s lockdown exit strategy, with Shetland’s MP claiming the Prime Minister is coming under too much pressure from Conservative backbenchers.Alistair Carmichael says he fears the PM is failing to rely on scientic evidence which has so far guided measures taken to combat coronavirus.It comes after Mr Johnson signalled measures would be eased on Monday next week.Identying ways for businesses to get staff members back to work are among the possible areas for change.Meanwhile, the Scottish government has welcomed a fall in the rate of deaths linked to coronavirus north of the border.But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned progress against the virus was “too fragile” to “immediately ease restrictions in any meaningful way”.For his part, Mr Carmichael believes there may be “some opportunities” for relaxing restriction measures # but onlythe science backs that up.s: “Some of what I hear does worry me, because it looks to me assome of what they are talking about involves easing lockdown because they are getting pressure from their own backbenchers to do that.Coronavirus Disease  Graphic. “The question of how we manage lockdown has to be done on the basis of scientic evidence.”He added: “My worry is that the longer it goes on the more influence the economy and political considerations will make over scientic and medical ones.”Mr Carmichael added his priorities would be to get school children back in their classrooms and “as many local businesses as we can ing again for the benefit of the people who need local services”.“I think it’s probably unrealistic to expect that we’re going to have tourists coming back here for most of this season,at all, and I just think these are the areas where we feel lockdown the hardest.”He added: “I don’t think you’re going to get back to full schools from zero.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally. Thus, as stated in HMS Aylmer’s Report of Proceedings:once the last Loch Eriboll U-boats had been processed, and in his fortnightly diary of events dated  May , the Flag Officer-in-Charge, Greenock, Rear Admiral Sir Richard Hill, reported to the C-in-C WA that:In summary, for two weeks in May , Loch Alsh was a centre of U-boat-related activity. It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead. However, even after the arrival of  EG, its berthing and mooring facilities were inadequate for handling the ex-Loch Eriboll U-boats at the required speed. moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal, both of which were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each could accommodate the disembarking German crews and each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats.They were therefore pressed into service, and between  May and  May facilitated  EG’s processing of the U-boats.In that short time  of the U-boats were escorted to Lisahally and one to Liverpool,  torpedoes were removed and disposed of,  German crew members were searched, and , of them were landed for transfer to POW Camps.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3102034.jpg--.jpg?1588582662000\n","title":"parcels delivered by ballee community association","story":"Ballee Community Association have played their part in helping the commuity during the COVID crisis.The Association were awarded pound funding from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and then match funded pound from their own reserve funds to make  emergency parcels for older residents in Ballee.

And while the Executive at Stormont holds firm about no changes to the current lockdown, you soon get a sense that a gradual release has left the starting blocks a little earlier than the authorities might have liked.It is a bright, sunny early afternoon, and even before you reach the town there are signs that lockdown may be wearing thin. Some people are unpacking a picnic at a table in a lay-by.Hidden away behind Lough Neagh, you will find the people who inhabit rural Mid Ulster often feel they are forgotten about away from the bright lights of Belfast.And examining the statistics around Covid-, you will find the rates of the virus are a lot lower than where.Social distancing is being well observed.Outside the several chemists along the main street queues have formed. People stand two metres apart. Several are wearing masks. Entrance is on a one-in, one-out basis.One thing you do notice is that most of those around the town are older.There are no young families, few teenagers. Most shops remain closed. There is no reason for them to be there, so they are not.Yet Cookstown is billed as the retail capital of Mid Ulster.In a small area you will find Tesco, Asda and an MS Foodhall. Homebase and Halfords are open.Throw into the mix BM Bargains and Poundland and that magnet draws them all to one central location.As more shops have come out of their enforced hibernation, so too have the people.At the snf of a nibble to feed their starved retail need, many are biting.In one convenience store there is an admittance that the number of people out and about is on the rise.There#s definitely been an increasing number of people coming in, I am told.And what we#re seeing is more and more older people, possibly coming back two or three times a day.There are very few younger people and teenagers.Cookstown is a hub for a wide area of townlands dotted around the Sperrins and along the shores of Lough Neagh where people do not have access to chemists and supermarkets.They all gravitate to the main town.And while the younger generation content themselves by staying in touch through social media, that is not the way the older generation do things.The scope for loneliness is much wider in the rural community, but perhaps that environment gives a sense that the population is shielded by the wide open spaces around them.And this is a town without a bypass.Everyone travelling through Mid Ulster has to go along the . miles of the main street. There is no alternative in a quirk of geography and infrastructure.While that might explain the amount of traffic, the sense remains that the community is making a slow and gradual choice to ease back to le as they knew it.On the other side of town, two miles along the road to Omagh, a police car is stationed at the gates of Drum Manor Forest Park - a reminder to everyone that the current advice on non-essential travel still stands.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Yesterday UK Environment Secretary George Eustice warned there will be no dramatic overnight change and the government will be very cautious.Wales# First Minister Mark Drakeford announced three modest adjustments from Monday to restrictions there. The Scottish First Minister, meanwhile, hinted there may be a region-by-region approach to easing lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon said there was a helpful recognition in her call with the Prime Minister that the four UK nations may well move at dferent speedsour data about the spread of the virus says that that is necessary to suppress it. Meanwhile, Mrs Foster said it was important to move together as a bloc with the rest of the UK to send a clear and simple message to the population. She said restrictions in Northern Ireland, extended on Thursday, would remain in place for the foreseeable future. But she said it was important to offer some hope to the public. She told BBC Breakfast: There#s a dference between sticking with the restrictions and making nuanced changes. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFirst Minister Arlene FosterPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFirst Minister Arlene FosterDuring those three weeks we can look to seethere are some nuanced changes we can make and I would put going out more for exercise in the open air as a nuanced change rather than a fundamental change. I think those things can be looked at... but what is important is the regulations are put in place for another three weeks. Mrs Foster said she spoke to Mr Johnson on Thursday, and he said he was moving forward with maximum caution. He, and I as well, want us to move forwardwe can in a four-nations way, she said. Because when we do that we have a simplicity of message, we have a clarity of message, and people really understand what#s really going on when we move together as a bloc. Yesterday, on a visit to Dungannon, Ms O#Neill repeated calls for an all-island approach to exiting lockdown.She said the message, for now, remained to stay at home - but indicated plans for a loosening of restrictions would be made public in the coming days.Ms O#Neill added: We said we will publish an exit strategy and it will be here by the start of the week.Every action we take, we won#t know the impact for a few weeks. People want to know in June and July they#ll be able to do #x,y,z# and I want to hopefully be in a position to give that information at the start of the week.Ms O#Neill said that regardless of what Mr Johnson outlines tomorrow, the message here was the same. She added: My message is very clear. Stay at home for the next three weeks. We#re going to have an exit strategy to give us all some hope for the future. We live on an island, We need to work together across the island. It makes good common sense. The disease is spreading across the island at the very same rate. It#s important we work together as best we that we can and we have to recognise the fact hat the disease doesn#t stop at the border.At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Eustice said the Prime Minister will set out a road map tomorrow about how the current restrictions can evolve. He said the four nations are all working together to try to have a broadly similar approach.Mr Eustice said the UK is not out of the woods and that the UK will live with the virus for some time to come. He said: We will have to wait for what the Prime Minister has to say on Sunday but I think what I can say is this - he#s going to set out effectively a road map of how we can evolve the current restrictions. We have this complete lockdown at the moment to something where certain activities may become possible in the short-term, in the near term and other things might take much longer. We have to be realistic that there isn#t going to be dramatic overnight change, we will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have, as the data we#re outlining on a daily basis shows we are not out of the woods. There are still major challenges, we will be living with this virus for some time to come and it#s therefore important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our NHS. He added that all devolved administrations attended Cobra meetings and while each may take slightly dferent approaches they are working together to try to have a broadly similar UK approach.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While it is true that many unionists - including those in the Assembly - have reservations about how Boris Johnson has handled the crisis, they remain cautious about pursuing any strategy which would see Northern Ireland signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of the United Kingdom.And Sinn Fein - very keen to play the England#s problem is Ireland#s opportunity card at the moment - doesn#t want Executive strategy to be signicantly out-of-kilter with the rest of Ireland.Issuing joint statements about working together in the Executive is one thing but actually working together, particularlyit#s in a way that seems to favour one national government approach over the other, is another thing entirely.In a letter on April , following Leo Varadkar#s announcement that the Irish Government would begin a unilateral process to ease lockdown restrictions, Mary Lou McDonald wrote: You announced last night that the caretaker government is preparing a plan to lt the public health emergency restrictions, with steps to progress this plan taken every two to three weeks ... A safe exit strategy must be, by definition, all-Ireland. This will require close collaboration and co-ordination with the Executive in Belfast.This all-Ireland mantra has been at the heart of Sinn Fein#s approach to Covid- since the beginning, with many of their key players linking it to the much bigger constitutional project of Irish unity.Understandably, that approach has angered most of unionism, including many inidual unionists who aren#t, in fact, supportive of the UK Government#s sluggish approach to the crisis, or the reality that there have been more Covid- deaths in the UK than in any other European country.There was also anger when Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney wrote in his blog a few weeks ago: Disturbingly, the extension of lockdown in the short term masks an argument which is being encouraged by some right-wing elements in the British Cabinet and also by some unionists in the north of Ireland that the lockdown measures should be relaxed and that economic activity and productivity should be resumed. It is the typical capitalist reflex which puts the market economy first.The problem for Sinn Fein is that Leo Varadkar has now pushed ahead with his own proposals to relax lockdown and encourage the resumption of economic activity and productivity, and has done so without consulting either Sinn Fein or the Northern Ireland Executive Yet, Regina Doherty, the Irish Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, seemed to defend not formally telling the Executive first: At the end of the day, I think the most important thing that we needed to do was to tell the people that we serve the Irish people. And that is what the Taoiseach did at the first opportunity after the cabinet meeting was over.Yet, even though Sinn Fein has expressed anger at Varadkar#s not consulting the Executive and Doherty#s defence of him, the party still feels obliged to support him, rather than any UK-led alternative.There had been hope in some quarters that the nature of the crisis would improve the relationship between the DUP and Sinn Fein. But evidence suggests that the constitutional gulf between them remains as wide and as isive as ever.And while it is true that the number of deaths here is lower than originally predicted , there has been no corresponding indication of cross-party agreement on what needs to be done next. Ironically, the success in keeping the numbers down seems to have exacerbated the policy strategy disagreements between them.Sinn Fein has been pushing for the Executive to publish a plan for easing restrictions, but that seems to be more to do with keeping Northern Ireland in step with the Irish government rather than waiting to hear what Boris Johnson will say on Sunday.Michelle O#Neill wanted the plan published yesterday, but with the UK Government favouring a UK-wide strategy built on conversations with the devolved administrations, I#d be very surprisedthe Executive agreed to jump the gun and publish its own proposals.From the unionist perspective, it#s also a matter of not creating new gulfs with the UK Government, particularly at a time when the Executive and Northern Ireland will need massive economic support from that government for the next few years.That#s not to say that the Executive couldn#t, or won#t, produce a recommendations document which might feed into Johnson#s thinking before Sunday#s speech.The Scottish Governmenthas already made a case for some bespoke arrangements while the nature of the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic also favours a bespoke approach in some, very specic, areas.But since the Irish Government has clearly embarked on its own approach to easing lockdown and kick-starting the economy, it would now seem oddthe Northern Ireland Executive decided not to wait for a lead from the UK Government. Indeed, Johnson may already be considering the Varadkar proposals as a potential template.It#s also worth bearing in mind that nobody really knows how the easing of restrictions in some countrieswill work.An awful lot seems to depend on people exercising common sense, avoiding complacency and adhering to social distancing rules and continuing lockdown regulations. There is no guarantee that will happen.And nor is there a guarantee that there won#t be a second wave of Covid-, which could actually be much more devastating than the first wave. For all of us, this is - and will remain - uncharted waters.Northern Ireland is in a very odd position: torn politically constitutionally between London and Dublin and with both the DUP and Sinn Feinseemingly electorally obliged to support competing strategies from Johnson and Varadkar, even when they have dficulties with those strategies.But, as I have noted many, many times down the years, and in relation to a whole host of issues, the dreary steeples outlook will always trump a genuinely collective approach.And even though the Covid- crisis is a unique challenge we have, as ever, ended up in our default position.Am I surprised  Not really. The border continues to eclipse and predominate every other consideration - even a unique crisis of this magnitude - and I don#t see that changing anytime soon.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It doesn#t look like anything can beat her, she said.We were all worried when we got the news last month that she had tested positive in the nursing home, but she#s been through a lot these past couple of years and it seems this virus wasn#t going to beat her either.Ethel, born Margaret Ethel McFadden with two sisters and two brothers, has always stuck by what she knows best - Belfast le.She#s now living at Bradley Manor off the Crumlin Road. She knows what she likes and she likes it there, Ashleigh explained.Ethel, who grew up on Silvio Street, just off Crumlin Road, believes there#s no big secret to her longevity beyond simply enjoying le.I love a cup of tea and cream buns. Chocolate eclairs are my favourite, she said.I still think of myself as a -year-old who loves dancing.Although my hearing has gone a little these days, I can still give a good scolding when I need to.Having lived through the Second World War, the Belfast blitz and the Troubles, Ethel has endured hard times during her  years.Her mother died when she was just six years old. After marrying and having two children, my father Samuel and his sister Lorraine, she lost her husband Jim to cancer  years ago, but she kept on going, Ashleigh told this newspaper.She suffered a bad fall when she was . She spent several months in hospital with a broken hip and wrist and contracted MRSA while when was in there, but we#re all delighted to still have her with us as she reaches  years.Contracting coronavirus was a big concern for us, but thankfully, though she tested positive, her symptoms turned out to be quite mild. Throughout it she was determined to stay in her home. She wasn#t for going to hospital and wanted to be where she felt safe and secure. The care the staff at Bradley Manor gave her helped her stay where she wanted to be. We just can#t thank them enough for all that they have done these past few weeks. Coronavirus still knocked her back a good bit and, given her age, the recovery is slow, but we all take it in turns to FaceTime her every day. She might not be up to date with technology, but the staff in Bradley Manor have been fantastic in helping her. She loves nothing more than seeing her great-grandchildren. All the family have been there for her in whatever way we can.None of us have actually seen her since the home closed to visitors in the middle of March. While we did have plans to celebrate her birthday at Belfast Castle and let her look down over the city she loves so much, we#ve obviously had to put any big family gatherings on hold until the situation changes.But we have been in touch with Bradley Manor and we#re all hoping to be there in the car park next week to see her on her birthday.Though she#s in bed most of the time recovering, the staff are hoping to get her down to reception and wheel her to the door so she can see all of us.Birthday cards can be sent to Ethel, addressed Bradley Manor,  Crumlin Road, BT GEBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, said: We#ve got to be trained how to live with it for a considerable amount of time, rather than sit tight and hold still.Mr Kelly was speaking after Stormont#s decision on Thursday to extend lockdown by a further three weeks.He believes with the right advice and training, the public and workplaces canalongside coronavirus safely and said good practice from the manufacturing sector could be used as a benchmark.He said: The evidence is clear that the measures taken already have given the community the shock that is required to get us to radically alter our behaviour but it#s also clear coronavirus won#t disappear from our lives, for a considerable time, eventhey do find a vaccine we will have to wait until enough people are vaccinated.In the meantime we can#t sit and wait it out.Already we can see that people are becoming more relaxed so let#s educate them in a way that prepares us to live along side this virus. I think we are at that time Stephen KellyIf you look at work places in manufacturing, those environments are controlled and a huge focus is placed on hygiene and it works and evidence proves that.What we need to do now is inform the public the way we do in manufacturing workplaces. We can take that example out into the community. It#s about training and engaging and we need to talk and train the community, let them know what works and what will keep them safe.Already we can see that people are becoming more relaxed so let#s educate them in a way that prepares us to live along side this virus. I think we are at that time.Mr Kelly said around % of the local manufacturing workforce was back at work after firms put stringent social distancing, staggered shts, strict hygiene regulations and more measures in place.He said on Monday more manufacturers wouldto work in barely recognisable workplaces following signicant investment in social distancing. They#ve invested a huge amount of time in risk assessments and it#s all been done with the best advice from the right authorities and it#s supported by unions.Gareth Latimer, a director at business advisory firm Grant Thornton, said recently that an extension to the lockdown would produce an increase in job losses and personal and corporate insolvencies.He said: Obviously,the economy suffers a deep recession, there will be more corporate failures. If unemployment rises as expected, there will be more personal insolvencies.The outlook is not positive… Mr Latimer#s warning came before the CBI said the UK economy had suffered a momentous downturn in the first quarter of the year, with a % fall in private sector activity - the steepest decline in  years.Economic development agency Invest NI said  of its client companies had made redundancies and  had furloughed a total of , staff.First Minister Arlene Foster said the economy suffered a loss of approximately £.bn for each month of lockdown.The British Chamber of Commercedirector general Dr Adam Marshall said businesses now need clear information on how to resume operations. He was speaking after a survey by BCC showed that almost a third of businesses would require notice to reopen.He said: Over the coming days, business communities will require clear forward guidance from government on plans to reopen parts of the economy, transport networks, schools and local services.Our results show that businesses# ability to restart quickly ies by company size, and by sector. For these reasons and more, it will be crucial for the government to maintain and evolve support for businesses, to give as many firms as possible the chance to navigate a phasedto work.The communication of plans for the easing of restrictions must begin immediately.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While lockdown restrictions continue, the number of people using bus and rail services to get to work has been increasing in recent weeks.Davy Thompson, Unite Deputy Regional Secretary, told the Belfastthat more certainty was also needed on funding and on arrangements for cross-border services.Whilst the lockdown may be eased, the reality is that a lot of companies are going back to work and more people are using public transport, he said.Therefore we believe it should be mandatory for passengers to wear face coverings. All the drivers are behind protective screens but our concern would be for our conductors, they can have masks but it should be required.On north-south journeys, he questionedconductors could be asked to police dferent regulations as they crossed the border.He added: We believe that to be completely unfair and it just needs to be standardised across the whole of Ireland.Mr Thompson said that Translink#s resources had fallen signicantly in recent weeks, adding: There has been money sent to Stormont for Covid-, but I#m not aware that the department has got anything out of that at this point.He added that maintaining social distancing could mean it is necessary to run two buses for certain services. Social distancing currently means that capacity is limited to no more than % on buses and % on trains.Ms Mallon said she had been clear with Executive colleagues that Translink must be properly resourced.She also warned that using face coverings should not lead to a  sense of security, and social distancing should still be maintained during journeys.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But that is the wrong way of looking at it.  For a start, the longer the lockdown persists, the more negative the health impacts for some people.There has been an increase in domestic violence, domestic murder, depression and, presumably, suicide.Equally, the focus on Covid- has meant that other illnesses are not being treated - some people with strokes and heart attacks are not presenting quickly to hospital and dying as a result.And there is a strong relationship between income and wellbeing. Poverty costs lives. Some families cannot afford to feed properly because of the Covid- emergency. Children in the poorest families are going hungry. Academic studies have already made clear that far from us all being in this together, the financial cost of the lockdown is bearing most heavily on the poorest members of society.It is the poorest who are unable to work from home, who are less likely to have the skills to find other jobs, who do not have savings to fall back on. They are more likely to work in the gig economy, in insecure jobs that do not qualy for the furlough scheme.So it is important to emerge from lockdown as quickly as possible, for reasons of health as well as wealth. But that is not the same as arguing that this is the right moment to #go back to normal#.For a start, we will not be going back to normal.Personally, I don#t intend to fly for at least  months. I imagine many others won#t either. And evenI ever wanted to go on a cruise, I wouldn#t now do so for many, many years. They have shown themselves to be disease incubators.So parts of the economy will only be able to emerge very slowly from this emergency. But also, it is too soon. Imagine large numbers of people ing to pubs and public transport. One ill person could transmit the coronavirus to large numbers of other people.We would then have toto lockdown. And potentially, that could be much more damaging. If we get a #high# from being freed from our homes and then two weeks later we get a #low# from going back, with a perhaps even stricter lockdown, my guess is that will delay the ultimateto a strong economy.Wariness and distrust will be built into the community psyche - which could be severely damaging for a long time. When we look around the world for examples of the best way of dealing with this crisis, New Zealand stands out.It took decisive action early and has been able to release the lockdown soonest.Official statistics suggest that while there are grounds for optimism that Northern Ireland#s death rate is falling, the decline is not yet sufficient to be confident that a release from lockdown would not generate a new spike in the diseaseBy contrast, the United States was slow in taking strong action, has the world#s highest death toll and is now risking permanent damage to both the population#s health and its economy by leaving the lockdown too soon.The lesson surely is to leave the lockdown as soon as we can be confident it will not lead to a surge of new cases.That surge could be catastrophic in terms of deaths, but also in economic damage from the psychological impact and wariness in eventually going back to a ing economy.Official statistics suggest that while there are grounds for optimism that Northern Ireland#s death rate is falling, the decline is not yet sufficient to be confident that a release from lockdown would not generate a new spike in the disease.However, Northern Ireland is clearly in a better position than is England - where the virus seems some way from being under control.That suggests the debate should now focus on whether Northern Ireland should adopt dferent policies than England and a faster speed in emerging from lockdown.And also whether the lockdown here can be ied in ways that do not create serious risks - perhaps by allowing more freedom to exercise or shop, possibly subject to mask wearing .We can probably all agree that this is a discussion that needs to take place.Paul Gosling specialises in economics, accountancy, politics and personal financeBelfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He said his Government provides funding for food banks.What we do not do is post on Facebook pictures of our ministers visiting them and handing out food to the poor, he added.Mrs O#Neill, on a visit to Dungannon yesterday, accused Mr Varadkar of engaging in party politics.Leo Varadkar#s policy and Fine Gael#s policy will always be akin to a Tory policy, she said.I believe that his comments were unbefitting of even a caretaker Taioseach. I#ll make no apology for any Sinn Fein minister, or any minister for that matter, looking after those people who need them right now, people who are shielding, people who can#t get out to buy their own food. So Leo#s comments are more about party politics and the fact that he wants to try and form a government at the exclusion of Sinn Fein.Earlier Sinn Fein Stormont Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the Taoiseach#s comments were ill-judged.I think he is rattled from the last election and the success of the Sinn Fein vote there, she told the BBC#s Good Morning Ulster. I think this is part of his continued pursuit of excluding Sinn Fein from government formation and I think it has to be put into context of government formation talks are going on at the moment.What Leo doesn#t add, because he shares the same politics as the Tories, is  years of Tory austerity and the impact that has had on our health service in responding to this pandemic.Ms Hargey said that she was very proud as Communities Minister to be involved in giving out more than , food parcels to those in need during the pandemic.In the Dail the Taoiseach and Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald clashed over the €-per-week Covid- pandemic unemployment payment.Sinn Fein ministers on their Facebook site promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor, reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean Leo VaradkarMr Varadkar responded to Ms McDonald by highlighting that payments for the unemployed are far lower in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Fein is in power.He suggested the rates were so low that Sinn Fein ministers were forced to deliver food parcels.Sinn Fein ministers on their Facebook site promote the fact that they hand out food parcels to the poor, reminiscent to me of Donald Trump handing out toilet roll after the hurricane hit the islands in the Caribbean, he said.I would be ashamed to do something like that. Do not blame it on the Tories and do not blame it on London. If it was not for their money, it would be even worse, he added.In response Sinn Fein highlighted pictures on Twitter showing Irish Housing Minister Eoghan Murphy delivering meals on wheels to his constituents. Mr Murphy retweeted the images to his own Twitter account.Ms McDonald said she was very proud of the community work her members do across the country.It is not just in the North that people are running meals on wheels and bringing packages and parcels to help people who are struggling, she said.Belfast Most ReadI am remorseful, says former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt as he quits role at Stormont after flouting lockdown rules Incident the latest headline for Mike Nesbitt, a man rarely far from the spotlightMP Little-Pengelly tight-lipped over her #Pride# tweet as party says it has no issue with the wordsFostering ambition: We profile politician Arlene FosterAncient Red Hand symbol of Ulster still has power to ide Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was recently announced that the Department for Communitiesfood box scheme was capped with an overall delivery capacity of , boxes per week across Northern Ireland and will be time bound. In terms of delivery to the Derry City  Strabane District Councilarea, full capacity has been reached and there can be no increase beyond the , of food boxes received. Currently, it is estimated that there is an existing demand of , Food Boxes which is  in excess of the current allocation and consequently a reserve list has been formed. googletag.cmd.push People Before Profit Cllr Shaun Harkin commented: I and many others arealarmed to be notied that the Department for Communities has capped the weekly free food parcel scheme for those shielding and in financial hardship across the North. We are calling for this decision to be reversed immediately. In Derry and Strabane , people have been accepted to receive a food parcel but the number has been articially capped here at ,.  people havebeen placedona reserve list with no guarantee they will receive food help. Its also been announced no further referrals will be accepted even though many people are not aware the scheme exists. This is discrimination and a breakdown in the departments duty of care for those in need. googletag.cmd.push Since the Executives decision to implement Tory welfare reforms our already high levels of deprivation have rocketed across the North. The clearest example of this was the rising dependence by many iniduals, familiesand workers on food banks. The Covid- crisis isputting many more people into financial hardship. Now is not the time to cut off access to the food program - funding should be increased based on need not on an articial figure thatunderestimates food poverty. The Covid- crisis has already forced many more people to apply for meagre welfare benefits. And many more people will be forced to applytheir jobs dont . With more people unemployed and dependent on benefits food poverty will increase further across the North. The Stormont Executive has the responsibility to make sure this is addressed. Political establishment parties are already talking about the need for austerity and hard choices - working people and the vulnerable should not be forced to bear the financial burden of this crisis. On April  the Department for Communities Covid  said its FoodParcelService has been hugely successful in getting immediatefoodand essential supplies to those most in need, with , boxes having been delivered to the  Council distribution centres in the three weeks since the service started. This service is part of the emergency response for those who are in critical need offoodand have no other means of accessing it, either through deliveries, or help from family and friends. A Department for Communities spokesperson said: “The delivery offoodparcelsto those in need was developed as one of the key strands of the Departments emergency response to the current crisis situation. The service has been a major success with a large number of boxes being delivered to those in need via partnership working between Councils and our grass roots Community Organisations. When theschemeopened it was envisaged that approximately ,foodparcelswould be needed, but due to the current situation the Department has delivered thousands more.” “Our current suppliers have now informed us that it not possible at present to go beyond a supply capacity ceiling of ,foodboxes per week. This is due to the sourcing offood, the capacity of suppliers to pack, prepare and distribute at volume – and additional limitations such as the need for social distancing requirements. We will continue to deliver to the thousands already receiving theparcelsand the Minister will be holding urgent meetings with officials to explore all available options.  “This service is one element of our overallfoodsupport programme, aimed at those who are in most critical need. People can also use the helpline to be connected to other means of support, including volunteers who can collect shopping, or community groups andfoodbanks who can provide support. For those people who still require access to such help contact the COVID Community Helpline on    in the first instance.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs.

The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The full nature of the financial crisis facing the local council was made public for the first time today. In a report by senior council officers brought before a special meeting of the council, it was stated that the council is currently incurring losses of around pound, per month as a result of the closure of facilities and services. The local authority is also having to cope with additional waste management costs and exceptional emergency expenditure as a result of the coronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push The council report stated: This will likely be worsened following the first quarter as the impact of the pandemic hits Council’s rate-base and the current rates relief scheme for business comes to an end. Whilst a regional bid is currently being considered by Central Government, this has not yet been confirmed and may only part fund some of the financial loss being incurred. At this point, it is therefore clear that reserves will not be adequate to fund Council services for the year ahead and Council will be in a position of insolvency by September .  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Launching the new initiative, Desi Derby, Marketing Director for SuperValu and Centra in NI said: “Our frontline workers are going above and beyond and doing a fantastic job – making sure shelves are stocked, delivering to those in need and ensuring customers stay safe when in store. googletag.cmd.push We have been overwhelmed by the dferent messages of thanks and appreciation that have come in from our customers whether on social media or via our customer services team and so we wanted to recognise this in the first instance. “Those same frontline colleagues also work tirelessly every year to raise money for Action Cancer and asked how we could do more when social distancing prevents the normal fundraisers such as in-store cycles and coffee mornings. So, we decided to bring the recognition of our colleagues and our commitment to support our charity partner together. We are now asking customers to take the time to nominate the person in your local store that has made a real dference. Andat this time of crisis, when our charity partner Action Cancer is seeing a substantial drop in income, being able to help support them too is extremely important to us.” People can nominate their local store hero on the SuperValu or Centra Facebook page or by emailingsupervalu.localhero@musgrave.ieor centra.localhero@musgrave.ie.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff. Maybe we will get to do that in a few weeksrsquo time.ldquoItrsquos going to be interesting to see what new music comes out from artists after the lockdown but Irsquom always on a bit of a lag with new stuff as by the time Irsquove written a new song and wersquore recorded it, itrsquos three years later. The good thing about this time is that itrsquos given me an opportunity to finish a lot of lyrics where I just didnrsquot have time before. Irsquom wrapping up a lot of songs that I started in , so expect our coronavirus album in .Hersquos disappointed, as are local fans, that the bandrsquos planned Belfast gig has had to be postponed until at least the autumn.Best of Teenage Wildle is available now for streaming on ious s and to purchase from Ashrsquos official website store https:store.ash-official .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ballycran.jpg","title":"Ballycran members sewing scrubs for frontline workers  ","story":"SCRUBS made by a group of women from St Josephrsquos GAA Club in Ballycran are now being worn in the Belfast Nightingale Hospital and several local nursing homes and medical centres.The colourful easy wash garments are brightening up NHS nurses and care workers as they look after patients and residents during the coronavirus lockdown.Some lucky frontline staff are wearing Manchester United scrubs or Paws Patrol made from themed duvets.Mrs Marguerite Fowler, sister of club chairperson Shane Gilmore, is co-ordinating the cross-community effort.The core group of sewers are Pamela McGourty, Brenda Coyle, Madeline Bell, Ann Moan, Anne OrsquoBrien, Madeline Branf, Caitlin Savage, Fiona Gilmore and Geraldine McGrattan. However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear. They find scrubs are so much easier to wash and dry than their own clothes.She said that while the GAA club put the initial call out for help and donations of material, it was very much a community effort.GAA clubs in Portaferry and Ballygalget have also donated duvets sheets and other items, already washed and ready to sew.ldquoWe are also very excited about a delivery of brand new fabric, funded by a grant negotiated by Iain Bell from Kircubbin and District Community Association and we thank him for his generous help.Scrubs provided are free of charge, but the group do like to see photographs of staff wearing them afterwards.Mrs Fowler said the group are able to take requests for specic sizes which might otherwise be dficult to get and they can be contacted via the Ballycran Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Community.jpg","title":"Community allotment group looking for new volunteers  ","story":"TUCKED away in a corner of the New Model Farm housing estate in Downpatrick is an oasis of calm amidst the turmoil of the coronavirus pandemic.Downpatrick Community Allotments has gone from strength to strength since its launch a number of years ago and there is also a healthy and particularly thriving apiary.With so many people confined to home as part of the the governmentrsquos lockdown directive, the group behind the allotments is keen to recruit new volunteers to help with their upkeep.Those responsible for the allotments are hoping that people will come forward to get involved in and enjoy the many benefits of working on the plots, especially at a time when the focus is very much on looking after your mental health.That the allotments can continue to operate is due to the fact the strict regulations in relation to social distancing are rigorously enforced, with the focus not just on the health of the plants and vegetables being grown, but also of all those tilling the land.Indeed, the community allotments initiative is a success story which continues to blossom and has transformed what was once an area of wasteland into a thriving hub which is also making a positive contribution to the environment and the lives of those who use it.Developed by the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella group for a number of community groups across the town mdash the allotments have become a blooming success in more ways than one thanks to the horticulture skills of the volunteers who have learnt new skills and gained confidence as a result.A vibrant and growing community initiative has firmly embedded itself in this part of Downpatrick and continues to flourish, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the volunteers. Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park area in the town and an assault on a woman in Church Street.Mr McGuigan says he is concerned at the number of recent events, which include a local family having to be rehoused in emergency accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the Church Avenue house.The owner was asleep at am when he was disturbed by the intruder whom he chased out of his home.But the burglar, who is described as five foot  inches tall and believed to have

Proceeds of this yearrsquos event will be donated to the Northern Ireland Hospice and Marie Curie Cancer Care.Jenny Adams, the showrsquos joint secretary, says the commemorative booklet is a good account of how the show has evolved over the years.ldquoIt is certainly interesting to see the role it originally played in improving the standard of farming in the Killyleagh, Killinchy, Kilmood and Tullynahill areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Collins.jpg","title":"Goalkeeper Collins selects his all time greatest Down team  ","story":"THE early s saw ato the glory days for Down. The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him.

I usually deliver approximately  school sessions per week to roughly  pupils in Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI play and coach for Comber Rec Ladies. I am proud to have played a key part in bringing womenrsquos football to my home town team and for helping to create opportunities for almost  seniors and  juniors to enjoy the game.Heather says parents can help teach their children with the help of weekly videos which are being released by the IFA and Electric Ireland.ldquoThese videos are fantastic tools for keeping your budding football stars interested in sport and passionate about football, as well as encouraging them to stay active while their usual activity sessions are on hold, she said.The Shooting Stars programme provides opportunities for girls aged - to have fun, make friends and learn the fundamentals of football. Sessions are normally held at  centres across Northern Ireland.Heather says the programme is a starting point for young girls who are encouraged to take the next step and join a local club.ldquoObviously with the current situation the sessions have not been taking place but the coaches have been working hard to ensure that the girls are staying connected, keeping up their skills at home by putting out a iety of social media videos with challenges and tips.The weekly videos can be viewed on IFA social media channels on Tuesday and Fridays..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Lockdown.jpg","title":"Lockdown no hindrance to local runners of all abilities  ","story":"A LOT is being said and reported about the absence of sporting activities on foot of the cancellation or postponement of many major events, including Sundayrsquos River Rock Belfast City Marathon, because of the need for social distancing to combat the spread of the Coronavirus.The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics will impact seriously on all the athletes who had been training for the races of their lives this summer, some as the culmination of their careers.But it is not only the elite runners, throwers and jumpers who have had their plans and lives disrupted by the world wide pandemic.It affects everybody who takes exercise in any shape or form, including the runners of all abilities who may not be a member of any athletics club but have been running for years and for whom running has become a way of le.I know that runners often go out on their own to train and in fact many have been resourceful over the past week in finding places which are virtually people free to enable them to complete their training sessions in safe surroundings. I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In

implementation of additional operational procedures, in line with government guidance.ldquoWe will continue to review the appropriateness of this activity on a daily basis to ensure that it remains

Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family.

I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so. A decision also has to be taken on what waste will be accepted at the sites in the short term.ldquoThe last thing we want is everyone landing at the sites, people getting out of their cars talking to one another and maybe not social distancing. People are still dying s a result of the virus and we must keep that in mind.Cllr Walker said that while many people have been cleaning their homes, garages and outhouses during the lockdown, the council needed to ensure that its civic amenity sites can reopen in what he described as a ldquosafe and proper manner.He added: ldquoWe need to manage the reopening process carefully and ensure there are not long queues of people waiting to use the centres, particularly in Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Castlewellan, with tailbacks of cars spilling on to busy main roads.ldquoThe council does not want to put ratepayers at any risk and, in my view, is rightly proceeding with caution. It is not a simple case of opening the entrance gates and letting everyone in.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that the decision to close the recycling centres is continually being reviewed in-line with government essential travel restrictions.ldquoThe council is currently reviewing this guidance and the implications it will present when it reopens the centres within the district, the spokesman continued.ldquoIf a decision is made to reopen the centres, residents will be informed via updates on the council website, social media channels and through local media outlets..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Ryan.jpg","title":"Ryan bakes tasty treats for heroic postmen  ","story":"SOME superheroes really donrsquot wear capes ndash they deliver the post.To honour the work of the often unseen heroes of the local postal service Ryan Bogues has delivered a hamper of his famous baked treats to the Royal Mailrsquos Downpatrick sorting office.The  year-old, who has Downrsquos Syndrome and lives in Teconnaught, has has to suspend his popular Ryanrsquos Cookie Box initiative, which he started over four years ago, because of the coronavirus lockdown.Ryan was praised by Prime Minister Boris Johnston last year for fundraising for several charities through his Cookie Box scheme where people donate money for his baked goods.Hersquos helped by his mother, Hazel, who explained a line in a recent speech from Taoiseach Leo Varadkar inspired them to think of local postal workers.ldquoMr Varadkar used the line lsquonot all superheroes wear capesrsquo and that struck a chord with us, she said.ldquoWe have had to close the Cookie box, but Ryan wanted to still help. We have an excellent postwoman and thought that the postal workers were among the very many key workers who were all working really hard to ensure that their service goes on as normal so we felt that they deserved a Ryanrsquos Cookie Box hamper.She added that Ryan bakes enough goods to donate two hampers per week since the lockdown and they have gone to nursing homes, pharmacists and hospitals as well.The hamper, which contained a range of buns, traybakes and lemon drizzle cake was well received by the  men and women who work at the sorting office at the Ballydugan Road Industrial Estate.Manager Donal Carabine received the hamper last week and said it helped lt everyonersquos spirits.ldquoEveryone at the delivery office has been working hard to both work in new ways to ensure everyonersquos safety at work while continuing with our service, said Mr Carabine.ldquoWe are delighted to have been recognised as being amongst key workers by Ryan and his mother and the baked goods are appreciated by all.

In anticipation of what none of us wants to hear, politicians at Westminister got an earful from no less a person than Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, who warned there could be ‘social unrest’the over s are ‘forced to endure a longer lockdown than the younger generation’.This is a country where once upon a time women could retire at  and men at  – as that was regarded as old age. But people have been living longer due to better living standards, the results of all the hard work the baby boomer generation put in right up to the present time. This appears to have emboldened successive Governments to raise the age of retirement age for both men and women. More money in the public coffers is the result.

Please try again later.Submitting...The retirement age may well rise in the longer term to  yearsnot , a prospect feared by every worker in the country. Yet, politicians remain silent on this. Putting up the age of retirement also means there will be less years for state pensions to be paid out.I worry at what appears to be the increasing use of the term ‘healthy over s’. What exactly does that mean  Few people in this age category I suspect enjoy perfect health, otherwise GPs across the land wouldn’t be advising them to take statins to keep blood pressure levels down. Women have been encouraged to take HRT long after menopause, even staying on it for leneeds be. These le enhancers, as some medical people appear to regard them, may be just the ticket. But how are we to know since the latter, statins, are relatively new to the people whilst HRT still attracts controversy Do either of these treatments increase longevity  We simply don’t know the answer to that question.Locking down the over-s, many of whom will still be paying tax to the Government, could be interpreted in many ways. I will take the kindly approach and suggest that the Government will need all the scope it has to get the economy back up and running schools will have to be re-opened and plans will have to be laid for the possibility of a future pandemic since the current one caught everyone by surprise and left the country on its knees. With the absolute necessity to get people back to work and paying income tax, the Government must have thought the oldies could wait and since many of them will have ious ailments it could be dressed up as ‘protecting them’. One Cabinet minister has said the whole thing ‘is to be based around consent rather than compulsion’.That’s fine, but it appears no one asked us first whether we wanted to be lockdowned for longer or left to do our own thing.I certainly do not want to be on lockdown for any more weeks than I have to because once you hit your s le seems to go by in a flash. It seems no time since my children were clinging to my skirts wanting me to play in the garden. Anniversaries and birthdays came and went with me so busy I scarcely noticed. The children grew up with me hardly noticing the years go by and then they were off to university. They found themselves wives, leaving us at home, on our own, wondering where all the years had gone. But still we felt young, still able to work and go on holiday.We hardly noticed our th birthdays, then last year it was the th wedding anniversary. We still have brothers and sisters and the only recognition of ageing is when the much older members in the wider family, the true older generation, pass on. I don’t think I’m the older generation yet.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
