Or any moves from Flashdance.But hey, if a stern-faced child known as ‘the backpack kid’ can do it and seem cool, surely you can as well? Here’s the low-down on the floss…After building confidence, you can also bring in other moves with your arms if desired, but this is not mandatory.The floss dance originates from an Instagram-famous American schoolboy, 16-year-old Russell Horning, known as the backpack kid.Back in the summer of 2016, Russell’s dance videos began to include the floss, so it’s taken a while to build this level of buzz.Dele Alli attempts the dance to mark his 22nd birthday (Pictures: Snapchat)Fans of the backpack kid started to copy his moves and the floss became his signature dance.Then in May 2017, Russell – who now has nearly 2 million Instagram followers – was invited on to Saturday Night Live to perform his dance alongside Katy Perry when she sang her tune Swish Swish.Celebs who have now attempted the dance include Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown, Tottenham ace Dele Alli and GMB’s Kate Garraway and Charlotte Hawkins.Why is everybody doing it? Well, sometimes the internet commands, and we mere mortals can do nought but obey.(Picture: Giphy)If you’re not a fan of a dance that makes it look like you’re flossing your nether regions, why not resurrect the twerk, the Harlem Shake or the stanky leg?MORE: Jason Gardiner age, partner and is he returning to Dancing On Ice?MORE: How old is Piers Morgan, what is his net worth and who is his wife?"},{"url":"http://metro.co.uk/author/miranda-larbi-for-metro-co-uk/\" class=\"author url fn\" rel=\"author\"\u003eMiranda Larbi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan class=\"post-date\" itemprop=\"datePublished\"\u003eWednesday 18 Apr 2018 11:28 am\u003c/span\u003e\u003cmeta itemprop=\"dateModified\" content=\"2018-04-18T11:29:42+0100","title":"pay 3 80 eat deconstructed vegemite toast","story":"(Picture: huonoliverInstagram)Deconstructing foods may have gone out of fashion over here but over in Oz, eateries are still experimenting with breaking down dishes into their simple elements.Cafes like Core Espresso, who are selling deconstructed Vegemite toast for AUS $7 (£3.80).The cafe in Newcastle near Sydney has been criticised after serving up two dry slices of toast on a wooden board, alongside a smear of dark spread and a lump of butter.Because everyone has their inidual ideal ratio of butter to Vegemite, they’ve left it up to the customer to spread it on themselves.While that sounds fair enough, it doesn’t quite translate into real life.Because while toast toppings are personal, it doesn’t take much just to give people a jar or bowl of the stuff.And if having autonomy over your breakfast really means that much to you, what are you doing ordering it in a cafe?

Voyager 2’s next encounter was with Neptune in August 1989. Both Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, will eventually leave our solar system and enter interstellar space.MORE: Sorry, you’ve probably been saying the word Uranus wrong your whole lifeVoyager 2’s images of the five largest moons around Uranus revealed complex surfaces indicative of varying geologic pasts. The cameras also detected 10 previously unseen moons.The 11 rings of Uranus, opaque and a few kilometres wide each, are relatively young in space terms – not more than 600 million years old. They were probably formed by collisional fragmentation of several moons that once orbited the planet (Picture: BSIPUIG Via Getty)Several instruments studied the ring system, uncovering the fine detail of the previously known rings and two newly detected rings.Voyager data showed that the planet’s rate of rotation is 17 hours, 14 minutes.The spacecraft also found a Uranian magnetic field that is both large and unusual. In addition, the temperature of the equatorial region, which receives less sunlight over a Uranian year, is nevertheless about the same as that at the poles."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7917027.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"woman left swollen bruised burst lips injections went wrong","story":"Elizaveta Tkachenko and Irina Lobach before the injections.

Getting fillers puts you at risk of an allergic reaction or an infection.But if that knowledge alone isn’t enough to make you proceed very carefully, maybe Elizaveta’s story will.Elizaveta Tkachenko, 30, wanted to increase the size of her lips on the cheap – so she turned to her friend, Irina Lobach, to do the procedure.Irina, an accountant, said she had studied the treatment and other beauty procedures in her spare time, and had begun treating clients at her home.The fillers didn’t go well.Elizaveta’s lip burst in two places, and she experienced difficulty breathing.

Pictured above, Meghan and Prince Harry earlier this year But although King concluded the 2013 interview with the actress by joking about Silverstein \u0027missing out\u0027 on Meghan, he says he doesn\u0027t feel like he\u0027s missed out on anything.Now happily married to photographer Cynthia, 36, and father to two daughters, Ami, 10, and Laila, five, he said: \u0027Meghan\u0027s wonderful and I think she\u0027s a fantastic person and a very strong person but I\u0027m very happy with my wife, who I think is perfect for me.\u0027He would still love an invitation to the wedding next month (\u0027I love a wedding!\u0027) and cheekily suggests he would be more than enough to balance out the phalanx of ex-girlfriends Harry, 33, is said to be inviting.But the main thing, he says, is that Meghan gets to be happy. \u0027I think Meghan will be a very empathetic princess,\u0027 said Silverstein. \u0027I think she\u0027ll be a compassionate princess and I think she\u0027ll be one who pays attention.\u0027I think this is very the stars lining up, that\u0027s how it feels, which is pretty cool.\u0027But as far as someone that I\u0027ve dated, from my past, meeting someone and falling in love with them, I don\u0027t think it matters that he\u0027s a prince – I think it matters that they\u0027re happy and in love together.\u0027Jokingly, beatbox artist Silverstein, who regularly appears on The Late Late Show with James Corden, added: \u0027Meghan, if you\u0027re watching this, call me!\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/12/4B3766B000000578-0-TV_presenter_Ant_McPartlin_said_he_has_let_himself_and_his_famil-a-1_1523965054274.jpg","title":"Ant McPartlin doesnt want deserve sympathy says Piers Morgan","story":"    Meanwhile, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said McPartlin deserves no sympathy for what he\u0027s done    TV presenter Ant McPartlin said he has let himself and his family down and is \u0027truly sorry\u0027 for smashing into two family cars while twice the legal alcohol limit.

Witnesses said the female passenger sitting next to it was partially sucked out of the aircraft through the whole and had to be held down           This was the row of seats where the window was shattered. According to witnesses, passengers had to pull the woman back into the aircraft when she was sucked towards the window and some of her body was drawn through it          This was the view from on board the Southwest Airlines flight of the blown-out engine after the plane made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport.

A huge thank you for her knowledge, guidance and bravery in a traumatic situation. God bless her and all the crew.\u0027Schults was one of the first female fighter pilots in the US Navy and first to fly an F-18. She later became an instructor, as the Navy did not allow women to fly in combat, and she finally resigned in 1993 when she joined Southwest Airlines. A mother-of-two, originally from New Mexico, Schults now lives with her husband Dean, a fellow pilot, in Fair Oaks Ranch, Texas.\u0027She has nerves of steel.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes and are used by all of Airbus A320 aircraft.          One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics           \u0027Heroes\u0027: Passengers thanked the five crew members on board for saving their lives. According to witnesses, the female pilot told them to brace for impact before she made the \u0027smooth\u0027 emergency landing  The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia. It was flying over western Pennsylvania at around 32,500ft at the time           The faulty engine was almost entirely exposed after the plane had landed The last time a passenger died in an accident on a U.S. airliner was 2009 when 49 people on board and one on the ground were killed when a Continental Express plane crashed on a house near Buffalo, New York.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s accident. It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The National Transportation Safety Board says a preliminary examination of the blown jet engine  shows evidence of \u0027metal fatigue.\u0027In a late night news conference, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades was separated and missing. Sumwalt says the blade was separated at the point where it would come into the hub and there was evidence of metal fatigue. He said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely.

Pictured above are residents overlooking downtown San Francisco as the fire rips through the city          The massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Northern California coastline, at precisely 5.12am local time on April 18th. Pictured above are people gathered following the quake as the fire continues to burn in the city          Although, the earthquake occurred before the Richter Scale was created, so the magnitude is an estimate. Some experts estimate the large tremor varied from 7.7 to 8.3.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. Johnny Galecki net worth revealed as Big Bang Theory star returns to RoseanneSouthwest Airlines passenger paid $8 to leave Facebook Live goodbye message on Flight 1380 Pornhub now accepts Verge cryptocurrencyNational Lottery: EuroMillions results for Tuesday, 17th April 2018 Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache?It turns out it could. Bruxism — the medical term for the involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, usually during sleep — is soaring. According to the NHS, as many as six million suffer, and the majority are women aged 25 to 44, like me. While it may sound like a minor irritation, it can do an awful lot of damage.Come on, Eileen!

Normal chewing puts between 20lb and 40lb of pressure on your teeth, but grinding or clenching can exert a force equivalent to an astonishing 300lb.It’s enough pressure to crack a walnut shell — and teeth-grinders can be doing it for as much as 40 minutes of every hour they’re asleep.          According to my boyfriend, who had to contend with me making an awful gnashing noise in my sleep, I did. But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache? (pictured: Lara King)No wonder it can take its toll on teeth, wearing them down and causing them to crack, break or become more sensitive.It’s also not uncommon for problems to surface in the neck, shoulders and back as the jaw muscles become so tight that pain is referred to other parts of the body.Teeth-grinding can even be behind a range of symptoms as varied as vertigo and hearing loss, by triggering inflammation in the inner-ear muscles.It can ruin your looks, too. ‘If someone grinds a lot you can sometimes see it in their face, because the muscles increase in size from overwork,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, aesthetic dentist and director at London Smiling Dental Group.‘It’s like building up your biceps with weights. You end up with more muscle mass in the face and jaw.’The result can be a square face, bulging hamster cheeks or ‘lantern jaw’ — a long, thin jaw with a prominent chin.          Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the triggerA British Medical Journal study also found that a loss of lower facial height due to teeth wearing down can make you appear as much as 20 years older.With all of that to worry about, it’s a wonder we ever sleep at all.So what causes teeth-grinding? The experts are agreed: stress.Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the trigger. Dr Patel’s practice has seen cases of bruxism rocket by 30 per cent in five years as our lives become increasingly high-pressured.Most of her patients are women, but Dr Patel has also started treating children as young as 11.She says: ‘When some people are stressed they break out in spots, or get rashes or stomach upsets. Others grind their teeth.’If you think a glass of wine before bed will relax you, think again. Not only does alcohol reduce deep sleep, making grinding more likely, but Andrew Eder, a professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, says that acidic drinks such as prosecco and white wine soften enamel so it’s more easily worn away through grinding.For me, two-and-a-half years after that rather painful lunch, teeth-grinding is a nightly battle that has left me with a fissure in one tooth, a clicky jaw and bouts of neck stiffness, headaches and jaw pain.And while the experts say that a spell of stress is likely to have triggered my grinding in the first place, they also warn that once it starts, it can become habitual. When I visit Dr Patel, she tells me that it’s left a line of dentine (hard, dense, bony tissue) visible on the edges of my top and bottom teeth — showing that I’ve worn away the enamel.Enamel can’t be replaced, and losing it raises the risk of cavities, decay and infection. I take good care of my teeth and pride myself on having no fillings, so it’s infuriating that something I’m doing when I’m sound asleep is damaging them.Still, it seems I’m one of the luckier ones. Emily Mason’s grinding was so severe she destroyed one tooth entirely and had to endure a root canal treatment.Emily, a 37-year-old communications consultant from Wokingham in Berkshire discovered she was grinding her teeth three years ago. ‘I had a lot of pain in what seemed to be every single one of my teeth,’ she says. ‘My entire mouth was aching constantly. I felt like I was going mad, because I just couldn’t get to the bottom of what was causing it.’Her husband Chris, 36, hadn’t noticed Emily was grinding her teeth, but her dentist eventually spotted the signs. In an attempt to stop it, Emily had three of her molars filed down, as her dentist suggested it would make her bite more even and let all of her teeth take the force of the grinding, rather than just one or two. But it wasn’t enough.‘Things came to a head last year when I had to have a root canal.‘I had clamped my teeth so hard together on such a regular basis that I had stopped the blood supply to a tooth. I was mortified that I’d allowed the situation to get to that point.’Emily admits she’s a ‘natural worrier’, but says: ‘I’m not sure what triggered it. I work full-time and have two young sons — Archie, seven, and four-year-old Rufus — and I don’t live near my family, which means the school run, helping at Beaver Scout group and generally being a taxi service all falls to me.‘But that’s nothing out of the ordinary for most mums.’In an attempt to break the cycle, she is now having her teeth straightened at a cost of £3,500.‘My dentist told me many of his patients who have done this notice they’re clenching less,’ she explains.‘If the alignment isn’t perfect, people may grind and clench their teeth trying to find a comfortable way for the upper and lower teeth to sit together.’Her Invisalign braces — clear plastic aligners that sit snugly over the teeth — will also offer her some protection.‘They will create a barrier and stop my teeth from hitting one another when I do grind,’ says Emily.Mouthguards worn at night are most dentists’ first course of action — but they can do more harm than good. Experts warn that the soft plastic variety that can be bought over the counter actually encourage grinding by inducing a chewing response.Dr Okoye recommends patients have a hard ‘splint’ mouthguard custom-made at a cost of up to £1,000. But even at that price, it won’t last for ever.‘The hardest substance in the human body is enamel, and if that’s ground away there’s no manmade thing I can replace it with that you won’t chomp away at, too,’ admits Dr Okoye.And while guards shield the teeth from damage, they can’t stop the grinding action, so a guard won’t necessarily alleviate the other symptoms.In desperation, more and more women are turning to radical treatments — including Botox. Tracey Jones, 49, a personal assistant, has spent at least £3,000 over the past five years on chiropractors and physiotherapists to try to relieve agonising pain in her back, neck and shoulders.Two years ago, her dentist diagnosed bruxism and said it was likely she’d been grinding for over a decade. He gave Tracey, from Cheshire, a mouthguard, but she says it didn’t stop the muscles clenching.Tracey, who is married with two grown-up daughters, is now trying Botox. More commonly used to smooth away wrinkles, the chemical is injected into the skin where it partially paralyses muscles. The theory is that injecting it into the muscles in the jaw reduces their activity.‘I had the treatment in September,’ Tracey says. ‘It took just five minutes and the effects last up to six months — although it takes ten days to start working.‘Each session costs £550, but today I estimate that I’m 85 per cent better than I was before.‘I’m sleeping through the night without interruption and when I wake up I’m no longer in pain.‘Fortunately it hasn’t affected my ability to chew or eat as it affects a different set of muscles.’But experts are ided on the safety of Botox for teeth-grinding, pointing to evidence that it may eat away at the jawbone.Our bones constantly regenerate, and rely on impact and muscle movement to produce new bone cells. When the jaw muscle’s activity is reduced by Botox, it can’t push and pull the jaw as powerfully, hampering the process.One study suggests a single treatment could trigger a loss of bone density of as much as 40 per cent, increasing the risk of teeth becoming loose or even falling out.So how can you tell if you’re grinding? Professor Eder says to ask your dentist to look for the tell-tale signs: ‘You’ll normally see a white horizontal line inside the cheeks, just adjacent to where the teeth meet, in people who are actively grinding.‘You may also see indentations on either side of the tongue.‘Eventually, worn teeth can become more sensitive, get sharp at the edges, chip and become shorter.’ Ultimately, the question remains: How do we stop something that we’re doing while we’re asleep?Perhaps part of the answer is not worrying about it too much. Dr Okoye says: ‘We used to try to cure people of teeth-grinding, but we now realise we can’t. It’s para-sympathetic, meaning it’s unconscious and involuntary — like breathing, or your heart beating.‘Instead, what we can do is protect the teeth with a mouthguard and give people tools to change their behaviour by learning to manage their stress. These can be as simple as sticking Post-It notes around your house saying “relax”.‘Many patients won’t realise how tense they are until they see that sign and consciously loosen up.‘Everyone wants some sexy, difficult treatment. But it really is just a case of stress management and creating an awareness of how important it is to relax.’As for me, I’ve decided to see if a mouthguard can help put an end to my waking nightmare — and to try not to let the daily grind wear me (and my teeth) down any longer."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/17/23/3414FAA700000578-5627591-image-a-8_1524004079656.jpg","title":"Year long squeeze family finances finally ended wages rise faster prices","story":"    Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said that snother milestone for employment has been reached under the governmentThe year-long squeeze on family finances has finally ended as wages rise faster than prices, official figures showed on Tuesday.In a boost to millions of workers, the Office for National Statistics said average pay was 2.8 per cent higher in the three months to February than it was a year earlier.It was the strongest wage growth seen since the summer of 2015 and meant pay was rising faster than inflation for the first time since early last year.

We started dropping,\u0027 he told ABC News. \u0027As kind of an indication of how terrifying it was, some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror. \u0027And some were crying as they looked out through the open window onto the engine,\u0027 he added. As the plane made its descent towards Philadelphia, the crew warned passengers to brace for impact.  Southwest Airlines has not acknowledged the woman\u0027s injuries.  In a statement it put out on Twitter, the airline said: \u0027Southwest Airlines flight 1380, which departed LaGuardia for Dallas Love Field , erted to PHL because of an operational event. \u0027The plane landed safely. No slides were deployed.\u0027 It has given no further comment on the injured woman or what caused the engine to explode.  When the shrapnel pierced the window, it depressurized the cabin and triggered the oxygen masks. Despite the chaos in the air, others said the emergency landing was fairly calm and smooth.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics   The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia. It was flying over western Pennsylvania at around 32,500ft at the time           The faulty engine was almost entirely exposed after the plane had landed Horrific accident caught on camera leaves three dead8-year-old girl raped and murdered a wedding in IndiaPrecious moment gorilla kisses her baby seconds after birthGermaine Greer predicts Meghan Markle will leave HarryBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental tortureGeorgia woman attacks pregnant soldier at restaurant and gets arrestedTerrifying moment surfer is mauled by four-metre great white sharkTwo surfers have been mauled by great white shark just hours apartDrug smugglers caught at Heathrow trying to move £16m of cocaineBritish rapper Kenny Vulcan has mysteriously disappeared in BrazilAlfie Evans\u0027s father front row of Pope\u0027s weekly general audienceJewish man is whipped with a belt in anti-Semitic attack in BerlinOne passenger told CNN: \u0027It was a stable landing.

That has to happen. Our fishermen will expect nothing less, and I trust the Prime Minister to deliver it.\u0027Jerry Percy, from the New Under Ten Fishermen\u0027s Association, the trade body for small fishing boats (classed as under 10m), warned there would be dire consequences if the UK\u0027s quota was not shifted from big to small fishing firms. He said: \u0027It\u0027ll be lost jobs, lost boats. It\u0027ll be lost local fishing landings. It\u0027ll be lost culture, lost tradition.\u0027Hastings fisherman Paul Joy said that leaving the EU was only part of the battle, and what needed to change was the quota system. \u0027We\u0027ve got an industry that\u0027s dying on its feet because what fish there is in the system is already allocated to the wrong sectors,\u0027 he said. \u0027More quota needs to go to the small boat sector, without any doubt.Bomb scare on residential street after fisherman...Fisherman performs C-SECTION on dead shark and releases 98...Share this article    A leaked draft of the Fisheries White Paper suggests the existing quota regime may not be significantly reformed after the UK\u0027s departure from the European Union next year\u0027If we win our battle with Brexit, that\u0027s one thing. Then it\u0027s how we share out the quota – sharing out the spoils of war.\u0027 Foreign firms own so much of the quota because, over the years, struggling local fishermen have sold their allocations to make ends meet.Emma Cardwell, researcher at Lancaster University, said: \u0027They would buy from fishing boats going out of business or fishing boats looking to make money by selling their right to fish.\u0027A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u0027The under-10m fleet plays an important part in our fishing industry and our coastal communities. Leaving the EU gives us the opportunity to design a new domestic fishing policy – one which is in the best interests of all sections of the fishing fleet and which allows our industry to thrive.\u0027Under current rules, foreign vessels registered in the UK are able to fish using the UK\u0027s quota if they make at least 50 per cent of their landings in UK ports, have at least 50 per cent of their crew normally resident in UK coastal areas, or spend 50 per cent of their operating expenditure in the UK. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/00/0655AC560000044D-0-image-a-1_1524009192838.jpg","title":"Struggling sing tune little whistle instead easier follow melody","story":"The results of the study help to explain why even virtuoso opera singers like Luciano Pavarotti could not match musical instruments like the violin for perfect pitch          The results showed that people\u0027s singing was less precise than their whistling          There is a population of iniduals- colloquially referred to as \u0027tone deaf\u0027- who are notable in their poor abilities as singersSinging may be harder because the larynx, which depends on complex muscles and lung action, developed later which makes it harder to control the voice.A study led by Bloorview Research Institute in Canada asked 34 people to copy simple melodies created at random by computer and to sing an ascending scale, hitting the highest note possible, as well as a descending scale to the lowest note they could reach.Excluding the six people who could not whistle, the results show people\u0027s singing was less precise than their whistling.The study, led by Dr Michel Belyk, from Bloorview Research Institute and the University of Maastricht, states: \u0027Despite the vocal virtuosity of humans relative to other apes, there is a population of iniduals- colloquially referred to as \u0027tone deaf\u0027- who are notable in their poor abilities as singers.\u0027However, tone deafness is a misnomer, as these iniduals do not necessarily have a deficit in hearing musical sounds, but rather in singing them.\u0027           Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a questionThe results of the study help to explain why even virtuoso opera singers cannot match musical instruments like the violin for perfect pitch. While humans have a direct pathway from the brain to the larynx not seen in other great apes, they seem to have problems using it completely accurately.The study authors recruited people who self-identified as good and bad singers to copy the two sets of 45 melodies created by computer within a single octave. They did so in a sound chamber with a microphone, with software picking up mistakes in their ability to match the notes they heard.The results show people who could whistle precisely were also better able to sing precisely. Notes which were sung, using a single vowel rather than words in the study, were more likely to be flat and whistled notes to be sharp.World\u0027s first singing road that plays German regional anthem...Share this articleBut c, according to the research published in the study Royal Society Open Science.The study states: \u0027Sung imitations were less precise than whistled imitations, although neither were on the order of precision that have previously been reported for continuous pitch instruments, such as the violin.\u0027 The results may show why our nearest relatives, the great apes, have the vocal abilities to blow raspberries and whistle but cannot sing.Humans can use their larynx to sing, inject emotion into their words and go up at the end of sentence to indicate they are asking a question. However the ancient relatives we share with the apes mastered the lips before the larynx, which is why we may not be perfect at this.The authors conclude: \u0027From the relatively recent evolution of vocal production learning in great apes, we suggest that evolution has not tuned the human vocal-motor system to the same degree as other neuro-muscular systems.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/06/4B45781300000578-5628465-image-m-42_1524028623413.jpg","title":"Is Stormy Daniels hinting secrets come","story":"    Stormy Daniels has sparked a new controversy -

He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,\u0027 Daniels told the crowd. \u0027He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.\u0027 \u0027That ends now,\u0027 the porn star said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/13/4B477DAC00000578-5628685-image-a-145_1524054466121.jpg","title":"Dig sunglasses Britain set sizzle 77F heat TODAY","story":"    Kitty Lam, 34, sunbathes in Regent\u0027s Park.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes.           One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning.

The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t.

It was comic book readers’ first introduction to the character, starring in the lead story by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.Now, Action Comics has become the first monthly comic book to hit its 1,000th issue. In the manner of major book and film releases, #1000 got a midnight release, with studio DC Comics encouraging comic book lovers to mark the historic issue, which includes stories from artists and writers including Brian Michael Bendis, Scott Snyder, Louise Simonson, Jock, and Marv Wolfman. But what are the most important issues in Action Comics’ 80-year history? Try these for starters:Forget Superman, it’s Uberman: Clark Kent is taking an innocent cab ride when his taxi is rammed by a rival firm’s vehicle. It’s the work of an organised racket aiming to take down innocent cabbies – but Superman’s having none of that.Apparently, this is the first issue where Superman is shown actually flying, which makes you wonder: why does he bother with taxis at all?Remember that famous 1940s Captain America cover where he’s shown punching Hitler? Well this is DC’s tilt at a titanic, though less hateful figure, as Superman physically assaults Father Christmas by forcing him down a chimney (he may actually be trying to help).Santa is a little too portly to fit, because evil millionaire Jasper Rasper has decided he hates Christmas and fed Santa sweets laced with “a new wonder drug which causes fatty tissue to multiply at miraculous speed!” And like the Joe Wicks of his day, Superman puts Santa on a high-intensity training regime. All just in time for Christmas.Now we’re getting somewhere – specifically, the North Pole. But don’t worry! No Santa Claus here: it’s just Superman wielding a gigantic golden key, which unlocks his Fortress of Solitude, introduced for the very first time in issue #241.The Fortress is like a super man-cave, where Superman keeps all his stuff (an alien zoo, a big metal diary in which Superman pens his memoirs, a chess-playing robot – all true). But you know that mate who keeps turning up when you’re just wanting to chill out on your own? Here, that’s Batman. Hasn’t he got his own cave to hang out in?Thirty years after his debut, Superman was put ignominiously out of work. And he didn’t even get a carriage clock. Our hero has been off doing something space-y, and when he comes back, he finds that Earth has become a very different place. All criminals have turned over a new leaf. War has been abolished. There aren’t even any natural disasters. It’s all thanks to the Sentinels, a group of mysterious aliens who’ve sorted everything out, and who tell Superman he can toddle off to a distant planet where his powers don’t work. Stupidly, he believes them. (For a bit).File this one under “Things they’d never get away with today”. In his Clark Kent guise, Superman works as a reporter at the Daily Planet, where his boss is Perry White, who once helped Superman with some problem bothering some mutants from another planet somewhere. To show their gratitude, the aliens give Perry White some special cigars, and every time he smokes one he gets super powers just like Superman. To think it would be only a few years later Superman would be having a pop at evil smokey joe and the UK’s Health Education Council villain Nick O’Teen.In the 1980s, DC embarked upon what would become an almost annual tradition in the world of superhero comics – completely rebooting its tangled continuity with a cross-title event called Crisis on Infinite Earths. As a way of saying goodbye to the old Superman, DC published a two-part story, started in Superman and finished in Action Comics, the end written by none other than Alan Moore. It’s actually a quite lovely “imaginary story” that brings in pretty much every aspect of the character’s legend of the preceding half-century … and ends with a knowing wink.This issue is notable for what actually wasn’t in it, which should have been a story written by Neil Gaiman. For a period in the late 1980s, Action Comics became a weekly, with a rotating roster of characters in the main story. This was the last issue before the comic returned to a monthly schedule, and Gaiman’s story featured Superman and Green Lantern in their alter-egos Clark Kent and Hal Jordan. However, DC ruled that Kent and Jordan shouldn’t know each other’s secret identities, so pulled it (and replaced it with something a bit similar by another writer).In the early 1990s, Superman died at the hands of villain Doomsday (an event that even made international mainstream news) and then was resurrected, a miracle that occurs in comics quite a lot. When he comes to, Superman has very long hair, and Metropolis is bombed and lies in ruins. Meanwhile, Lois Lane has been doing some investigating and discovered that Lex Luthor is, in fact, a clone and not his own son. It all got a bit Dynasty at this point.Although the Christopher Reeve Superman movie had introduced the evil Kryptonians led by General Zod 30 years before, those characters weren’t folded into the main DC continuity until this storyline, which was co-written (with Geoff Johns) by Richard Donner, director of the 1978 movie. It was also presented with a 3D cover to try to give the reader that full, freaky Phantom Zone (the other-dimensional Guantánamo Bay where Superman routinely chucked evildoers) experience.In 2011 DC had another reboot, and all the publisher’s comic numbering was reset back to #1, though this was in fact #904 of Action. The comics have since been retroactively dual-numbered to preserve the ongoing numbering of the comic.In this issue, wrtier Grant Morrison took over with artist Rags Morales to take Superman back to basics, resetting the continuity to tell the story of the nascent DC universe afresh. And guess what? Superman wore short sleeves and didn’t wear his red underpants. Thankfully for purists, he gets his knickers back on in number 1,000."},{"url":null,"title":"philadelphia plane emergency southwest landing engine explosion latest","story":"Plane makes emergency landing in Philadelphia after debris from exploded engine smashes window at 32,000 feetA woman has died after she was partially sucked out of a window on a Southwest Airlines plane that was hit by debris from a blown engine at an altitude of 32,000ft.Passengers scrambled to haul Jennifer Riordan back into the aircraft as the sudden decompression of the cabin pulled her partway through the opening, but she later died. Seven other people were injured. The pilots of the twin-engine Boeing 737, travelling from New York to Dallas with 149 people onboard, were widely praised for showing “nerves of steel” after they took the plane into a rapid descent and made a successful emergency landing in Philadelphia.  Passengers said oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and they were instructed to brace for impact, leaving some in tears, while others shouted encouragement. In a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, the captain, Tammie Jo Shults, reported that there was a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.A passenger, Alfred Tumlinson, from Corpus Christi, Texas, said a man in a cowboy hat had rushed forward a few rows to grab Riordan and pull her back in. “She was out of the plane. He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,” he said.Images of the plane on the tarmac showed a missing window and damage to the left engine, including part of its cover. A piece of the engine covering was later found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia, the National Transportation Safety Board said.The NTSB said a preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of metal fatigue. A full investigation is expected to take 12 to 15 months. The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009.David Gleave, an aviation safety investigator based at Loughborough University described the incident as a “completely freak event”, caused by an unlikely series of coincidences, each of which would have to be examined in detail. “Why did the engine fail? Why did the engine fall apart? And why did the blade get thrown forward out of the engine and hit a window? It’s an unfortunate series of things, but that’s what we need to get to the bottom of,” he said.Gleave said the engine’s metal cowling, or cover, should have prevented any parts flying out. Design flaws, manufacturing or maintenance issues were all possible explanations for what happened, he said.Passengers said Shults walked through the aisle and talked with them to make sure they were OK after the plane had touched down. “She has nerves of steel,” said Tumlinson. “That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”The US transport secretary, Elaine Chao, said the pilot, crew and others onboard had prevented a greater tragedy. Shults was among the first female fighter pilots in the US military, according to friends and the alumni group at her alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene University.Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York, said everyone had started shouting to brace for impact when the plane prepared to land. “I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed. And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”She said she was seated near the back of the plane asleep, when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. Bourman said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask but added: “You had a few passengers that were very strong and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this’.”The airline said in a statement that the fatality was the first of its kind inSouthwest’s 51-year history and extended its sympathy to all those affected.Gary Kelly, Southwest’s chief executive, said there were no problems with the plane or its engine when had been inspected on Sunday. Nevertheless, the airline announced on Tuesday night that it would inspect similar engines in its fleet over the next 30 days as a precaution.A Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine in 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16 inch (12-by-40cm) hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely. The NTSB said a fan blade had broken off, apparently because of metal fatigue.Gleave said the cause of the 2016 incident was still to be fully determined, but now that it had reoccurred there was greater urgency to do so because there were 2,000 737s in the air at any one time.Riordan, from New Mexico, was the vice-president for community relations at Wells Fargo bank, working with non-profit groups.

They moved to the UK in the early 1950s. Over time, they invited their children over, and most of my family have always lived in England.That’s the thing with Jamaicans: there’s as many of us abroad as “back home”, and migration is a way of life. Or rather, migration is a means of survival. Our families are transnational – we live between places. And so when my mum moved to the UK, in 2000, she sent for me two years later.I celebrated my 13th birthday in the UK and lived there for more than half of my life. But it was a life made so much harder than it need to be by the Home Office. All I wanted was a normal life: to go to college, to work, to hang out with my friends, and to support my mum. But I was “illegal”, and so I couldn’t work or pursue my education, and it was incredibly difficult.Things weren’t easy for either of us. My mum didn’t have her right to stay, and had to work cleaning public toilets and doing whatever her boss told her. I remember she used to cry all the time, especially when it was cold, and we had hardly money to buy food. We’d turn the house upside down just to find enough coins to buy a large chips and wings, and then we’d share it, happy at least to be together.When I was 19, I was living with a friend, and she fell into debt arrears and was threatened with eviction. We needed money to keep a roof over our heads, and agreed to collect some drugs for some guys. The police raided us on arrival and I was arrested.Of course, I regret it. That offence made it much harder for me to fix my stay. I know there are people who will say I’m a “foreign criminal”, but what does it mean to call me “foreign”? I never felt like “a migrant”. I was just trying to build a life in the place I called home, and deportation has been the worst punishment imaginable.I was exiled from my mum, my partner, and my stepkids. I left my friends, my memories and my home. I was forced on to a charter flight in the middle of the night, denied all appeal rights, and sent to a country I did not know. Jamaica is not my home. Jamaica is where I am a foreigner.I remember reading the Coming Home to Jamaica booklet in detention. The immigration officers and detention staff try to paint a rosy picture of Jamaica: they tell you about these organisations that will help you they say there’ll be people waiting for you at the airport that these organisations will help you with financial support until you get a job. These are false hopes, these are lies, but sometimes they are all detainees have.I just found the booklet frightening. It told me to “travel where possible in the day”, to “keep my cash and personal items hidden from view” and to “try to find lodgings in areas that are considered safe”. It told me not to “walk around after dark in unfamiliar places”, not to “discuss my personal situation with people I was not familiar with” and not to “allow strangers to know my destination”. It definitely did not make me feel like I was “coming home”.But the piece of advice that was hardest to swallow was this: “Try to be ‘Jamaican’ – use local accents and dialect (overseas accents can attract unwanted attention)”.How was I supposed to “be Jamaican”? I had not set foot on the island since I was a child. Who was going to help me learn to be Jamaican? My mum and my support network were in England. “Try to be Jamaican.” They don’t know how hard that is.When I came back, I felt this kind of embarrassment: a stigma. As a deported person you feel small people stare at you. People don’t understand you and laugh at your “proper English”. When you go to buy things, they can tell that you’re “foreign”, and all of a sudden the price doubles.So maybe their advice wasn’t that bad after all. But it’s hard to “be Jamaican” when you speak in a Brummie accent with a twist of cockney.I stand out. I walk into places I don’t know and people shout: “Foreigner, let me sell you something.” So yes, overseas accents do attract unwanted attention, but what am I supposed to do about it? One thing is for sure, being sent from the UK to Jamaica was not “coming home”.I’ve been back for over a year now, and I still can’t handle the heat.My mum got sick immediately after I was deported. First she became severely depressed and started to blame herself for not being able to do more for me. Not long after, they discovered she had lung cancer. It happened so quickly. The day they shut her life support machine off, the electricity had gone from our district and the mobile networks were down. My family tried to call me to let me say my goodbye but I was robbed of that chance. I have been robbed of so much.In September 2017, one year after I was deported, I buried my mother in Jamaica. Maybe she was “coming home”, but this island is not mine. My home and my memories are in England. I try to be positive but I can’t follow the advice of that booklet. It is impossible for me to “be Jamaican”. I am British, and even deportation can’t change that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed77415370f1beeb1449f373865a79a67632f4b/0_130_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d67b9c2a5e04a5f4f3faa6cf7e493893 1240w","title":"commonwealth global climate change new zealanders","story":"The task ahead is immense, but New Zealanders know it can be achieved. We have a proud history of this kind of leadershipLeaders of Commonwealth nations are meeting in London this week instead of the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu because things did not go according to plan. In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches.In only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation’s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.Vanuatu is one of New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours and friends – and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents – the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm.Such extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge.The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year’s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action.And while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate.We were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.That is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law.Our plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 – setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon.We are also active in building international cooperation on climate action.Nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers’ yields and build resilience while reducing emissions.Alongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality.The international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to.At this week’s Commonwealth meeting, I’ll be thinking about Vanuatu’s experience – and the summit that couldn’t happen. I’ll also be guided by a Māori saying from my country – Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri, ā muri ake nei – for us and for our children after us.That is what’s at stake when we talk about climate change – the world we’ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage.• Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister of New Zealand"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832a539d471bd5f7042f32752b3171c6c5316f34/0_131_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9dca786004a4423f4cf76d5c10617bfd 1240w","title":"first human on mars should be woman","story":"What do the names Kalpana Chawla, Mae Jemison, Valentina Tereshkova and Sally Ride mean to you? Until fairly recently, the names of these female space pioneers didn’t mean much to me. Despite being obsessed with all things space as a six-year-old girl, who thought a day out at the Jodrell Bank Observatory was as exciting as a trip to Disney World, I was never taught about them. I didn’t know that Dr (!) Tereshkova was the first woman to fly into space, that she was 26 when she went, and that when she took off she said, “Hey, sky! Take off your hat, I’m coming!” Nor did I know that Dr Chawla was the first Indian-born woman to go into space and that after she died in the Columbia disaster they named a hill on Mars after her.A senior Nasa engineer, Allison McIntyre, said this week that the first person on Mars should be a woman. And she’s right, because despite the incredible work of many female scientists and engineers involved in space exploration, there has historically been a “space gap”.Nasa is light years away from where it started: in 2016, it selected its first gender-balanced cohort of astronauts and it has a number of outreach programmes geared towards inspiring girls. We are also starting to see the traditional under-appreciation of women’s role in space being addressed in wider culture, from films such as Hidden Figures, which tells the story of the three female Nasa “human computers” working in the 1950s-60s, to the women featured in books such as Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls and A Galaxy of Her Own.But Nasa being one-third female isn’t good enough, and women still face barriers when it comes to representation in science, technology, engineering and maths. They face biases both explicit and unconscious, which can affect them throughout their careers, impacting whether they get research grants and lab space. There is a clear gender gap that opens up at age 16 before then, equal numbers of boys and girls study sciences. This gap gets wider the further up you go – we make up only a small proportion of professors. There is much that can be done about this, such as peer-reviewing hiring decisions, but the pace of change is agonisingly slow.A woman being the first person on Mars would not solve all this. But what a statement for Nasa to make. The gravity of it makes my head spin. Perhaps it is a failure of imagination on my part but the feeling of watching a woman become the first human to walk on Mars … I can’t imagine how it would make me and millions of other women and girls feel. How does it feel to watch a person of your gender set foot on a faraway celestial body for the first time? Could you write to me, men, and let me know?And while it wouldn’t make up for all the gender injustice in the world, it would be a damn good start. It would make a statement to the planet – not to mention possible life on other planets – that women are as deserving of stardust as men. I know I shouldn’t get my hopes up after all, look at what happened with Hillary Clinton. But nonetheless, this is my plea to Nasa: make a woman the first human in history to set foot on Mars. For six-year-old me. For all of us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41b88cca3c973ed7bfe5d3eea9a4505e45d0550d/0_29_886_532/master/886.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b9e10b7fa5d255f6f7533440dd3fdaea 1240w","title":"balkan dam projects could result in loss of one in 10 european fish species","story":"Exclusive: Plans for a network of hydropower plants in three countries would cause ‘chain reaction’ for endangered species, report warnsNearly one in 10 of Europe’s fish species will be pushed to the brink of extinction by a constellation of hydropower plants planned in the western Balkans, new research has found.Eleven endemic species would be wiped out, seven more would be critically endangered, four types of sturgeon would be devastated and the number of endangered species would double to 24, according to the University of Graz report.Prof Steven Weiss, the paper’s author, told the Guardian: “It is the largest systematic construction plan with negative environmental impacts that I know of, since world war two.”Weiss said: “The high density of what is being planned affects everything in the region. It transforms whole river systems into a series of reservoirs that need to be flushed. It breaks up migration corridors, and drains and isolates wetlands that have a dramatic effect on birds. There is a whole chain reaction.”The 11 fish populations most at risk are: Cobitis jadovaensis Alburnus vistonicus Delminichthys jadovensis Delminichthys krbavensis Phoxinellus dalmaticus Telestes polylepis Telestes turskyi Telestes ukliva Knipowitschia mrakovcici Eudontomyzon hellenicus and Zingel balcanicus.These are all endemic to the Balkans, Europe’s most important bioersity hotspot for molluscs and fish.One EU official told the Guardian that the study “should give us pause for thought. It’s clearly not possible for everyone’s plan to be built. Otherwise, you’re just pouring concrete over the entire region.”RiverWatch, the conservation group which co-commissioned the research, estimates that 2,800 hydropower plants are planned or under construction in the region, more than a third of them on Natura 2000 sites.Just three pristine waterways – the Neretva basin, Morača and the upper Drina system – alone host around 50 endangered and protected fish species.The countries through which they flow – Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro - are all investing in hydro, in a bid to meet the EU’s clean energy targets before joining the bloc, even though research suggests that hydropower annually emits as much methane as Canada.“This is one of the very painful activities we have to go through,” the EU source said. “These countries have plans for hydro to align with the EU’s rules on renewable energy but it is a sad state of affairs. The alternative for a number of them is not solar or wind, but coal and particularly, lignite.”The EU’s leverage over countries not yet in the bloc was limited to offering guidelines on standards, although technical assistance for environmental protection might also be considered, the official added.Ulrich Eichelmann, Riverwatch’s chief executive, said: “This report proves that Balkan rivers are the fish paradise of Europe. At the same time it is unbelievable that in the 21st century, hydro investors and politicians are risking this enormous natural value for something they call ‘green’ energy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a50e17b2d20ddc22271e71dfe82bda8d6c4e945/0_171_5126_3075/master/5126.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c0d79663a4ae459d75de6b4e45624286 1240w","title":"clean energy renewables projects stifled by tory reforms says labour","story":"‘Outrageous financial demands will have serious repercussions across the renewables sector’Labour has accused the government of holding back clean energy projects in the UK by allowing energy networks to impose “outrageous” charges on renewables developers.This week, two of the six companies that run the country’s local electricity grids began making green energy firms pay for an estimate of how much it will cost to connect their solar and windfarms. Previously the grid connection estimate was provided for free. However, it will now cost anyone hoping to connect a small renewable power station between £2,500 and nearly £10,000, even if they do not go ahead with the scheme.The shift was made possible by a government change to regulations earlier this year.Rebecca Long-Bailey MP, the shadow business secretary, said: “It was the Tories’ recent reforms that allowed for these outrageous financial demands to be made, which will have serious repercussions right across the renewables sector and for the future of clean energy.”Jeremy Corbyn has singled out network companies for criticism, saying they should be nationalised because they are overcharging and causing delays to green energy projects. Renewables firms said the move could deter new green projects. “It’s yet another hurdle on the path to a renewable energy future,” one small solar developer told the Guardian.They went on: “Until now grid connection applications for solar or windfarms were free – developers would put in an application to see if they could get a connection at a cost that would make a project viable.“But now the distribution network operators have decided to wring yet more cash out of the sector on top of already overcharging for grid connections.”Documents sent by network companies to renewable energy firms show that the cost estimates will be priced between £2,556 and £9,740. Green energy developers will now have to pay that cost regardless of whether they go ahead with their scheme, and before knowing how expensive the connection will be. The cost of the actual grid connection is in addition.Two network companies, UK Power Networks and the networks unit of big-six energy supplier SSE, have already informed customers of the changes, which they argue will spread costs more fairly.The other four groups that run local power grids, which solar schemes connect to, are due to follow suit.Network companies, which have come under fire from consumer groups for “eye-watering” profit margins, said the reform was necessary to make the connection process more efficient. Distribution network operators are receiving “hundreds, if not thousands” of requests each month for the estimates, known as ‘connection offer expenses’, one source said. The firms said the changes were revenue neutral for them and would not result in higher profits. A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association said: “The charges for connection applications have been introduced following a recent government consultation, which found that the majority of industry supported the change.“Under the old system a large number of speculative applications were being made without being followed through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6199c2342bf2024a7310dc1b94705df9fac0e99/0_190_3120_1871/master/3120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1bfcb2e6fc7a0e12d3926507e20cd7e3 1240w","title":"grease review john travolta olivia newton john","story":"Rereleased on its 40th anniversary, the nostalgic rock’n’roll high school musical remains a sugar-rush of a film“What happened to the Danny Zuko I knew at the beach?” With this stunned and plaintive cry, Olivia Newton-John introduces the main theme and narrative dynamic of this still very enjoyable 1978 movie based on the original stage musical, which is now on rerelease.Newton John plays Sandy, and she’d met such a sweet boy over the summer, enjoying a more-or-less platonic beachside romance and imagining she would never see him again once she went back to Australia. But her family’s plans changed and, with the new term, Sandy shows up at the local high school and is astonished to see Danny, played by John Travolta. Compelled to be super-cool in front of his gang buddies, he is crudely dismissive of Sandy, but secretly still in love with her.We hear the classic split-point-of-view song Summer Nights, in which Sandy regales her saucer-eyed friends with Danny’s gallantry and Danny jeeringly implies he’d had his way with her on the sand. The movie is all about male identity, peer pressure, sex in that pre-pill era and innocently imagined rock’n’roll. Grease was also about race: the title had overtones of “greaseball”. Blond Sandy is as Waspy as they come Danny and some of his gang are regarded as outsiders partly because of their Italian American ethnicity – and the same goes for Rizzo, as tough as any boy, played by Stockard Channing.Grease broke John Travolta through to family audiences who might have been chary about his more adult movie sensation, Saturday Night Fever, the year before. It was part of the 70s fashion for 50s nostalgia that also had its expression in George Lucas’s American Graffiti and Garry Marshall’s longrunning TV show Happy Days, and survived in the form of Robert Zemeckis’s Back to the Future in 1985. Travolta’s effortless dancing here is different from his lithe and narcotically sexy disco performances in Saturday Night Fever. In Grease it is more family-friendly. Still superb, less about pelvic grinding than about the quiff, elbows and the knees rotating in 45-degree shunts, as if he were appearing in an Egyptian frieze.

The project channels that movie’s hip activist sensibility. In one scene, a character wears the classic Talking Heads: 77 T-shirt, and it’s this combination of a band T-shirt and the film’s motif of female strength that, in early 2017, inspired Maycock to consider her own venture. “It made us think, ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if women in film were treated like rock stars – if Greta Gerwig and Annette Bening had their names on T-shirts, too?’” Celebrities and actors started to wear the T-shirts, too. Lady Bird cast member Tracy Letts proudly showed off his Greta Gerwig T-shirt at the Toronto international film festival Gerwig herself wore an Agnès Varda tee for a magazine feature. However mind-boggling such moments are for a small start-up brand, Maycock focuses on their cinephilic potential: “If Rooney Mara is seen wearing a Lynne Ramsay T-shirt and that means one more person sits down to watch Morvern Callar, we’re happy.”More than a year old now, Girls on Tops keeps expanding its reach. “We’ve been shown a lot of support, so we want to pay it forward,” says Maycock. Girls on Top has donated sales proceeds to Amanda Eliasson’s animated film Favourite Thing for Channel 4’s Random Acts Nia Childs’s debut short, The Other End, offers the chance to win T-shirts in exchange for funding via Indiegogo, and the brand’s website will become a platform for female-led film criticism. Meanwhile, Maycock’s team keeps adding names to its inventory. The transgender actor Daniela Vega, acclaimed for her turn in Sebastián Lelio’s A Fantastic Woman, will soon join the ranks of Girls on Tops, proving the brand’s determination to go beyond the mainstream film industry’s traditional, discriminatory limits.Today’s cinephiles are more aware of gender disparities. With the possibilities for streaming and conversation that the internet offers, they can expand their tastes beyond the usual canon of mostly male film-makers. In that sense, the shirts have a political dimension. “T-shirts have a great history as objects of protest. There’s a feeling of empowerment in being part of a collective who share similar ideas and want the same positive changes,” Maycock says.As its name suggests, Girls on Tops is elevating a new group of heroines to where they belong."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86390fa2d20a3ca7d122e937ae760358800fd533/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e9bbff51bb9013245bef5b5c622f0c2 1240w","title":"accrington stanley promotion league one","story":"Accrington, the small Lancashire town with a Football League tradition dating back 130 years, is celebrating as never before. Its team, for so long synonymous with underdog ignominy, have secured a first league promotion, more than 50 years after going bust and tumbling into oblivion. Their ascent to League One is the latest step in the extraordinary revival of Accrington Stanley, the self-styled “club that wouldn’t die”.Stanley first joined the league in 1921, following in the footsteps of Accrington FC, an inaugural Football League member who lasted for only six years. Their successor survived for longer but found things no easier. Trapped between Burnley and Blackburn, and circled by even bigger fish in Merseyside and Manchester, Stanley faced a constant battle to stay afloat.The club’s only respite from the bottom tier came in 1958, when they were drafted into the new national Division Three. Four years later financial problems forced them out of the league and by 1966 the club had folded. Stanley disappeared for two years before being reborn in the back room of a pub and settling into non-league anonymity.Their name became best known for a mocking reference in a milk advert. “Accrington Stanley, who are they?” may still have its own Wikipedia page but the team that the club president, Peter Marsden, called “the most famous minnows in the world” have now returned emphatically to the map.The stewardship of the long-time manager, John Coleman, and the owner, Andy Holt, who took over in 2015, has allowed the perennial strugglers to broaden their ambitions.The windfall helped Accrington climb into the Conference and secure full-time status, laying the foundations for an unexpected league return in 2006. Their new status brought back old financial concerns, with Coleman conjuring a late run of wins to keep them up in their first season, and the threat of a second bankruptcy was never far away.The team owe their league return and subsequent survival to a string of benefactors with roots in the town, from Whalley and Marsden to the banker Ilyas Khan and former Lancashire and England cricketer David Lloyd, enamoured of his hometown club’s will to “fart against thunder”. Marsden also wanted to turn Stanley’s hard luck story into a motivating source of pride. When he reappointed Coleman and his assistant, Jimmy Bell, in 2014 after a two-year absence, he urged the club to put aside their “misplaced sense of inferiority”.Holt’s investment has bolstered this new self-belief and the owner has become a prominent cheerleader. Last year he pointed out that the club’s £2.2m turnover was less than every current top-flight club spent on agent fees in a single year – in short, Stanley are “a starving peasant begging for scraps” from the Premier League table.The club’s main men have also endured run-ins with the Football League. Coleman spoke out after Carlisle were allowed to move home games in the wake of flooding in 2015, an option he claimed was not available to Accrington. This season Holt’s revelation that he gives the team £200 to spend in McDonald’s after wins has led to ill-advised EFL intervention. The league has since tried to bury the hatchet, presenting Holt with a burger at its annual awards ceremony days before promotion was confirmed.The Lancashire club\u0027s landmark moments  since they reformed in 1968620 fans turn up to watch the club’s first Lancashire Combination game – with Terry Tigle becoming the only player to play in both the old and new teams.The famous Milk Marketing Board advert airs for the first time, featuring two young Liverpool fans, Carl Rice and Kevin Staine. Their exchange – “Accrington Stanley, who are they? Exactly” – becomes the talk of school playgrounds nationwide.Now in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, Stanley reach the second round of the FA Cup, but lose to Crewe.A year after relegation, new manager John Coleman takes them straight back up to the Premier Division as champions.Stanley win the title and reach the Conference. They finish 10th in their first season, and reach the FA Cup third round, going full-time soon after.Coleman’s side wins the Conference by eleven points. Advert star Carl Rice is guest of honour as they reach League Two.After 16 months under ex-England striker James Beattie, Coleman returns, and, four years later, they reach League One.The forward Billy Kee, named in the EFL’s team of the season at last week’s ceremony, truly embodies the Accrington way. Released by Leicester City at the age of 20, Kee was nurtured by Coleman at a time when he wanted to walk away from football. The manager has not forced a nutritional regime on his target man and gave the striker time off to deal with anxiety and depression. He has repaid his manager with more than 50 league goals, including the double that secured promotion against Yeovil on Tuesday.On and off the field Stanley have reaped the benefits of doing things differently. After home wins at the Crown Ground, £1 pints of beer are served up to supporters, and Coleman has built a team worthy of promotion at an equally modest price. Promotion to the third tier for a team once best remembered as a punchline is an incredible achievement but not a shock based on recent results. Stanley missed out by the width of a post in 2016 and have lost once since Boxing Day.Kee, Coleman and even Holt, who has thrown himself into the realities of lower-league football, may need time to adjust to their new surroundings. They will play teams whose grounds could hold most of the town’s 35,000 population, but it would be a mistake to write them off. Theirs is a club that has survived and thrived by doing things on their own terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eae78171d03d7ce13200a6f8c99138603119dbb/144_87_1915_1149/master/1915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5e18e7cc3fc9dd0036e94c1b12b51437 1240w","title":"manchester city dominate pfa premier league team of the year","story":"Five Manchester City players have been named in the Professional Footballers’ Association Premier League Team of the Year.Having been confirmed as champions on Sunday after second-placed Manchester United lost 1-0 to West Bromwich Albion, the Etihad celebrations continue with the choice, by their fellow professionals, of defenders Nicolás Otamendi and Kyle Walker, midfielders Kevin de Bruyne and David Silva and forward Sergio Agüero as part of a three-man attack. Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah, currently leading the Premier League scoring chart on 30 goals, accompanies Agüero and Tottenham’s Harry Kane, who has scored 26 league goals, in that attacking line-up.

Completing the line-up, and despite last season’s champions’ disappointing title defence, Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso was named in a team he failed to make last year when losing out to Tottenham’s Danny Rose. Alonso held off strong competition from left-backs such as Liverpool’s Andy Robertson and Tottenham’s Ben Davies.On Sunday, the overall winner of the PFA Player of the Year award will be unveiled, with De Bruyne, De Gea, Kane, Silva and Salah all nominated, along with City winger Leroy Sané, surprisingly omitted from the Team of the Year.Wolves will be playing Premier League football next season after securing promotion, and have three players in the PFA’s Championship team of the year.

There was the accusation by Gambia on its withdrawal from the organisation that it was a “neo-colonial institution” and persistent charges of lack of imagination in its sometimes opaque bureaucracy.Then there has been concern about its vulnerability to exploitation for political gain by states stained with human rights abuse allegations – most notably Sri Lanka. But despite the periodic controversies, the real problem is how forgettable the Commonwealth has become, more associated with the quadrennial games in the public’s mind than with much else.In terms of global development – and at the centre of its renewed focus – ostensibly, its aims are admirable, not least the charter’s 16 values of democracy, gender equality, sustainable development and international peace and security. On climate change too, in particular ahead of the Paris agreement, the Commonwealth acted as a conduit for the views of smaller countries from the global south.In practical terms, much of what it does, not least in terms of the delivery of sustainable development goals, is open to the criticism that it only duplicates UK commitments whose main effort goes on in other forums like the UN. Perhaps most serious of all is the way in which – as Murphy intuited – the Commonwealth has become a vessel to be filled by the Conservative politics of Brexit, rolling a rose-tinted view of lost empire into the exigencies of finding new markets, gilded with a glib free market view of trade as the answer to poverty.What that means, as development secretary Penny Mordaunt and Liam Fox made clear in a joint article for the Telegraph this week, is what they described as “the beginning of a new approach to inclusive trade, development and prosperity”. In short that means increasing trade for the Commonwealth’s biggest economy – the UK post-Brexit – and pretending that is aid.It is the cynical papier-mache vision of not-quite-empire and of not-quite-development for a not-quite-important institution that only the dull fever dream of Brexit could inspire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f676da3c33daa5ea13a5503b6c2cccf5bc364/0_547_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d52132ac0838201978989a0f677b89cb 1240w","title":"held back from promotion too honest","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

I am strongly attracted to a friend with whom I work. We meet up once a year and work together for several weeks across the summer. The rest of the year, I’m in another country.Last summer I told him I was attracted to him, and his reaction was initially one of joy and surprise. Moments later his attitude changed and he started to talk about his “issues”. Over the next few weeks, he distanced himself from me. We did have one good talk, during which he said he was worried about detrimental effects on his mental health if things didn’t work out. I get strong signals that he would be very interested, except for this fear holding him back.Since separating our work has required us to remain in email contact. Besides work emails, I have sent several personal emails in which I have told him in detail about how I feel about him and how much I value and admire him, in the hope that it will give him some reassurance. I’ve not had much response, other than a brief thank you in acknowledgement, to these.I am in a quandary about what to do when we meet up again this summer. I flip between thinking I will keep my distance and let it go, and thinking I will push things a little further. But I am very worried that pushing things further may constitute harassment.You say you get “strong signals that he would be very interested except for this fear holding him back”, but the signals that you’ve described here are, alas, not that. You told your friend that you were attracted to him in person and he told you that he didn’t want to be in a relationship with you. You told him again, over email, how you felt about him, and you’ve “not had much response”.I’m sorry to say that I don’t think that your friend wants to date you. Who knows why not? It may be the “issues” he professes. It may be something else altogether, but the bottom line is that it’s not your job to persuade him otherwise.That’s not to say I don’t understand your desire to encourage him to feel otherwise! You mentioned that his initial reaction to you confessing your feelings was joyful, and it’s natural to wish that you could help him get back to that feeling. But what I learned from my own experience with ambivalent men (and oh my, I have known quite a few ambivalent men) is that the key to a successful relationship is two people wanting to be in a relationship. You can be kind and you can be encouraging, but you can’t make someone want to be with you by persistence and force of will.Will trying again to persuade your friend constitute harassment? I think it could be viewed as unwanted behaviour. Imagine if the gender roles were reversed: in this post-#MeToo world, a man who asks a female colleague out repeatedly after she says no would be seen as a creep. Even if he did not make a formal complaint if you “push things a little further”, your continued pursuit after your friend gave you a pretty clear no may make him uncomfortable, and have a negative effect on your experience working together. That would be a shame, since you clearly care about your friend and your work.Please don’t lose heart, or at least not too much. That you’ve written to ask me this question and that you don’t want to step over the line shows that you are a thoughtful and caring person. I’m certain that you will meet someone who you adore who will adore you back without caveat or condition or hesitation: someone who, like you, is ready, not afraid. I teach English as a foreign language and I’ve always been a bit wary about relationships related to work – both with colleagues and students (adult students, obviously). Although I’m relaxed about being friends with adult students outside of the classroom, I’ve always personally carried the idea that dating students is something that shouldn’t happen.However, I’ve met other teachers who’ve ended up in great romantic relationships with students (often after they’ve stopped being their teacher) and who now have happy marriages. I’m curious to know what you and others think, especially as it could potentially be an issue for me in the future.You gut feeling is correct: you should not date your students, even if they are adult students. The student-teacher relationship is inherently imbalanced in favour of the teacher’s authority, even if the student pursues the teacher, rather than vice versa. (Jo Livingstone wrote very well about this in the New Republic.) Your no dating students rule is right because it respects the reason that your students are spending time with you: to learn. A classroom is not a singles bar. I would also say that if a teacher is standing in front of a classroom of adult ESL students and thinking about which one of them is most attractive, rather than how to help them learn English, the teacher is … not really doing their job?Drawing the line at dating students also eliminates risks: that your relationship with one student might have a negative impact on your other students, your ability to do your job or your employer’s perception of your motivation and performance. These are all things that you’ll put on the line if you date a student, even if the relationship itself is True Love.Once someone is no longer studying under you, I think you can feel free to ask them out – when they’re not your student, but your peer. But maybe wait until they’ve been out of your classroom for a few days before you make your move, lest this give your employers the impression that you’ve been counting the days until the end of term."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffcb6ac076ffb304448ff2002ccc514ee36d052f/0_1420_3475_2085/master/3475.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b17fd15d7ea47fe7365b66134176a80 1240w","title":"pierre koffmann recipe for salade nicoise with seared tuna","story":"Avoid the pitfalls of a bad niçoise with this recipe that tops the salad with tuna steakThe “authentic” ingredients of a salade niçoise are debatable – potato and tuna being the most contentious.

Are cinephiles – and conventional broadcasters – right to fear for the future?At the Berlin film festival last February, Clare Binns took her seat for the premiere of a Spanish film that was generating a quiet buzz. She hoped it might play at Picturehouse Cinemas, the British chain of cinemas she runs. In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar.“It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.”Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly isive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds.Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.”Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form.Last week, Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.”Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sarandos was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sarandos wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”.But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year.“He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.”Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”.The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home.In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says.For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.”iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says.Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes.Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes.“If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test” if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds.Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so.In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e929a1bb0a90230afe46b51fe1064a265666ac3e/0_75_2216_1330/master/2216.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a790c3dfbc097779b1384770dedeafb9 1240w","title":"brexit first talks on uks future relationship with eu begin","story":"Senior British and EU officials to meet across a table to discuss the future trade ties more than a year after article 50 was triggeredSenior British and EU officials will discuss the UK’s future relationship with the European Union for the first time on Wednesday, in a milestone for the Brexit talks.More than a year after the government triggered article 50, British and EU negotiators will meet across a table to discuss the UK’s future trade ties.The talks will be mostly limited to a formal presentation on the negotiating guidelines agreed by EU leaders in March, as well as setting a schedule for future meetings. Nonetheless, it is a significant moment for the UK, 10 months after the Brexit secretary, David Davis, was forced to bow to the EU’s timetable, having previously promised the “row of the summer”.Before Wednesday’s meeting, the European parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, stepped up his call for guarantees to ensure that EU citizens can avoid the “bureaucratic nightmare” that has ensnared the Windrush generation.Speaking in the European parliament in Strasbourg, Verhofstadt called on the chief Brexit negotiators, Davis and Michel Barnier, to be ready to make changes to the withdrawal treaty, if MEPs deemed modifications were needed.“Certainly after the Windrush scandal in Britain we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens and that there is no bureaucratic nightmare there,” he said.Home Office officials will be grilled by a special group of MEPs next Tuesday in Brussels, where they will be quizzed on the procedure for 3.5 million EU citizens to obtain special status. Following that meeting “if there are changes needed we will also communicate to the negotiators, to David Davis to Michel Barnier, what modifications are needed to avoid problems for EU citizens” Verhofstadt said.While the European parliament is not negotiating Brexit, it has the power to veto the final deal and MEPs insist they are ready to use it.Wednesday’s talks are being led by Barnier’s deputy, Sabine Weyand, and the UK prime minister’s Europe envoy, Olly Robbins. Before talks on the future relationship, the pair are meeting to discuss progress on resolving the status of the Irish border, the most intractable issue of the talks.As that meeting was getting under way, Donald Tusk, the head of the European council, reiterated his warning that the UK risked leaving the EU without a deal if there was no solution on Ireland.“The UK’s decision on Brexit has caused the problem, and the UK will have to help solve it,” he told MEPs. “Without a solution, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition.”The Irish government, which is frustrated by slow progress, is pressing for a solution to the border question by June. So far Ireland has benefited from solid support from the rest of the EU, illustrated by a Manfred Weber, the leader of the largest European parliament group, who told MEPs on Wednesday: “We are all Irish in this regard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2019fced7d93af14d85ce6216f74d9ada8979306/0_14_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=53318337177f31f19695436b134fdcf6 1240w","title":"ministers to announce brexit climbdown as they face lords defeat","story":"Government braces for series of amendments including over customs union as withdrawal bill goes through upper houseThe government is preparing a climbdown over its key Brexit bill in the House of Lords over EU rules on clinical trials, as it braces itself for a series of defeats.Ministers are expected to accept the substance of an amendment tabled by crossbench peer Lord Patel, which would keep EU clinical trial regulations – which have not yet come into force – in UK law.The rules are aimed at streamlining clinical trials across the EU, allowing drugs firms to submit a single cross-EU application – and making it easier for pharmaceutical companies to conduct cross-border trials.A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DexEU) said the concession underlined the government’s willingness to accept changes to the complex bill as it makes its way through parliament.“We have always said we are open to listen to expertise, be it from peers or MPs, and if we think the bill can be improved, we will move to do so. That will be the approach through the whole process.”The EU withdrawal bill transfers EU law on to the UK statute book in preparation for Brexit – and grants the government sweeping powers to tweak it in the process.It reaches its report stage in the Lords on Wednesday, with the government expected to lose at least two votes: on a customs union, and future changes to protections such as workers’ rights and environmental law.Nine senior Conservatives, including two former Cabinet ministers, have put their name to various cross-party amendments.One deemed likely to succeed on Wednesday – because it has crossbench, Labour and LibDem support – was tabled by Lord Kerr, who drafted article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU.The amendment would commit the government to report to parliament “outlining the steps” it had taken, to secure “an arrangement which enables the UK to continue participating in a customs union with the European Union”.The DexEU spokesman stressed that even if the amendment were accepted, it would not keep the UK in a customs union, which is not government policy.But opposition peers hope that if the government sustains a hefty defeat, it could strengthen the hand of pro-customs union Conservative MPs, who have said they plan to force the issue in the Commons.Once the Lords has amended the bill, it will be returned to the House of Commons, which will decide whether to accept the changes, or refer them back to peers, in a process known as “ping pong”.The prime minister has postponed crucial votes on other Brexit bills, on customs and trade, to delay a confrontation over the issue of remaining in a customs union, which is now Labour’s preferred policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1cdd64d1c49b9ddfb95406961320f76beb9c109/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=852964bcd42088a8d6e8ee46b291a048 1240w","title":"split universal credit payments between partners to curb abuse ministers urged","story":"Experts tell MPs single household payments make it easier for domestic abusers to seize and regulate family incomeUniversal credit payments should be split between the male and female partner in claimant households to minimise the risk of domestic abusers exerting financial control over their victim, MPs have been told.Experts told the work and pensions select committee that universal credit’s single monthly household payment made it easier for domestic abusers to seize and regulate family income and prevent partners from leaving the home.Marilyn Howard, a financial abuse expert at the University of Bristol, told MPs: “Our concern is the one payment of universal credit can concentrate power and resources in the hands of one partner, and that carries the risk that abusers can take advantage.” Asked by the committee chair, Frank Field, whether the switch to universal credit increased the risk of women being bullied by their partners, Howard replied: “Yes, I believe it would do.”Witnesses from grassroots domestic violence refuges and charities giving evidence to the committee said the single universal credit payment allowed abuse perpetrators to “distribute family income in the way they see fit”.Universal credit rolls six working-age benefits into a single monthly payment with the aim of simplifying the social security system. However, MPs heard this this in effect “de-labelled” constituent payments, such as child tax credits, that were previously clearly earmarked for children, and paid to the main carer, normally the mother. Concerns over domestic abuse and universal credit were raised at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, where the the Scottish National party MP Philippa Whitford appealed to prime minister, Theresa May, to end the practice of single universal credit payments.May replied that single payments were available on request, but Whitford said changing the claim in this way made women more financially vulnerable. “Eighty-five percent of abuse survivors say they wouldn’t have dared to request single payments as a special measure as it would have worsened abuse.”Earlier this month the family support minister, Kit Malthouse, told the work and pensions committee that it was “completely without foundation” that universal credit would exacerbate domestic violence and insisted that single payments could be made on request. The committee heard that frontline domestic abuse workers were spending increasing amounts of time trying to sort out universal credit problems for victims of domestic violence, at the expense of the wider direct support they could offer.Delays and bureaucracy experienced by universal credit claimants had driven some domestic abuse victims back to their abuser, Nicola Kyser-Forrest, of Calderdale council’s homelessness department, told MPs.In one case an abuse victim had lost a place in a refuge because it was impossible to get officials to rule whether the woman, an EEA national, qualified for universal credit housing costs. “We couldn’t speak to anybody to get that confirmation, and so the refuge were unable to offer her a place, knowing that she may not be eligible for assistance. That led to the lady returning to her partner.” Demelza Lobb, of the Refuge charity, said the uncertainty and stress caused by universal credit delays had led to several women going back to their abusive partners. “They say: ‘It might be easier, at least I’ll have an income, I’ll be able to get food,’” she said.

Smith and Flower have both been interviewed for the position along with the former England players Mike Selvey and Derek Pringle, with the ECB poised to confirm its appointment this week.The move comes as part of a major shake-up of England’s selection process, instigated by Andrew Strauss, the director of England cricket, which will also involve Fraser and Mick Newell – directors of cricket at Middlesex and Nottinghamshire respectively – leaving their positions on the three-man panel. Instead, a new independent selector will appointed by the new national selector with the England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, remaining on the panel.Ashley Giles turned down an approach to succeed Whitaker this month while the Lions head coach Flower, who coached England between 2009 and 2014 before becoming the ECB’s technical director of elite coaching, retains a strong relationship with Strauss but is not expected to be given the role.Meanwhile, Australia have rejected speculation linking Justin Langer with the vacant head coach role, insisting an appointment has yet to be decided. Reports on Wednesday suggested Langer was close to being named successor to Darren Lehmann, who stood down in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last month.A Cricket Australia spokesperson said: “The process to be undertaken for the appointment of a new Australian men’s head coach will be discussed and agreed at the CA board meeting this Friday.“No appointment has been made, and nor will any candidate be put to the board for ratification on Friday. We expect to have a clearer understanding of the approach and appointment timelines following this meeting.”Langer, a former international team-mate of Lehmann, is among the front-runners for the position having enjoyed success with Western Australia and Perth Scorchers during his coaching career."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9993bc439a19bbfdcb3fe4b8969e0da7a58b9ecf/0_140_2159_1295/master/2159.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=34a3b37af2af13de6712a5da49f803a2 1240w","title":"leon pryce over coaching england australia rugby league","story":"The former Great Britain half-back Leon Pryce has said young English half-backs are being “over-coached” and prevented from playing the way which could be the answer to ending Australia’s dominance of world rugby league.England came within one game of winning the World Cup for the first time in 45 years last year, but their tournament was bookended by defeats against Australia in the opening game and the final, when they failed to score a point against the all-conquering Kangaroos in Melbourne.Pryce, who retired from playing last year to begin a coaching career, has concerns that part of the problem in competing with the best in the world comes from the way players are being encouraged to play from an early age.“I worry that coaches are working with these young kids, and in particular the half-backs, stopping them every two minutes during training and scrutinising their every move with them and, in truth, just over-coaching them,” he said.“We can’t keep over-coaching these lads let them play, let them try things outside of the box. It’s the only way we can compete at the highest level against the best in the world – by taking risks.”Pryce believes a solution would be in ensuring the previous generation of elite British halves remain in the game and working closely with clubs – something he believes is reaping rewards at the Super League leaders, St\u0026nbspHelens.“The likes of Lee Briers, Sean Long and Paul Cooke were all coached by the players themselves – and they learned by making mistakes,” Pryce said. “We’re blessed with a crop of highly promising youngsters right now. Players like Jack Walker and Danny Richardson look like absolutely phenomenal talents.“If they keep going down this path, they could easily be the answer – but a lot of what they’ll do is down to what they’re taught day-to-day. Richardson has the blessing of working alongside Sean every single day in training at St\u0026nbspHelens, so it’s no surprise to me he’s being talked up as a great half-back in the making.“Is a way to help by ensuring every club has a specific halves coach who’s played the game so they get proper tuition? Maybe. I’d love to see a way that the powers that be ensured people like Lee and Sean, as well as many others, aren’t lost to the game, because what they can bring to the table is vital for us as a sport and our hopes of winning major trophies at the highest level.”Pryce also feels the British game has to look at the Australians for answers as to how the issue could be resolved. “There’s a formula in rugby league that seemingly works, and it’s about completion rates and always taking the safe options. I’m not knocking any particular coach or any specific club, but if you go to Australia you’ll see that the half-backs are taught to play a completely different way down there.“We’ve continuously matched the Australians in the forwards for the last 15 years but it’s in the half-backs – and I include myself in that – where we fall short. The likes of Johnathan Thurston, Darren Lockyer and Andrew Johns have all been able to dissect a game with the skills and risks they’re encouraged to try from a young age.to pull apart the way young half-backs do things on video – it’s all very stop-start and if you make the smallest mistake it’s seen. I do genuinely worry that you’re coaching the genius and the ability out of these kids.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7c34991e4cd9f4f17332ff36d37fc9164eb43d2/0_120_3481_2089/master/3481.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c807245f033d76e21ba6f668e5d131a2 2600w","title":"peter sagan pope cyclist cycling paris roubaix interview","story":"His dramatic victory in the Paris-Roubaix has elevated the Slovakian to the pinnacle of his sport but his humble roots and carefree attitude seem certain to keep cycling’s new hero groundedSagan is the most popular rider in cycling today and, with the murky uncertainty surrounding Chris Froome and Team Sky, his victory felt like a shaft of light which revealed panache and grit. They call Paris-Roubaix the ‘Hell of the North’, because its 29 cobbled sections have a bone-juddering impact on even the toughest and most brilliant riders. It is also the glittering peak among the five monuments which are cycling’s oldest and most prestigious one-day races.This year the severity of the challenge was underlined by the death of the young Belgian cyclist, Michael Goolaerts, who suffered a heart attack. For just under six hours Sagan was also tested and his feat was accentuated by the fact he broke for glory a startling 53km from the finish. The Swiss cyclist, Silvan Dillier, clung to a narrow lead as they entered the velodrome, but Sagan was imperious in the final 100m.“Twice I didn’t finish Roubaix,” Sagan says, “and in those races I did finish I was in much worse condition than this year. If you’re fighting for first position your emotions are very different. I was not thinking: ‘This is the hell of the north.’ But you realise one, two, three days later how tired you are. Especially the first morning I was so tired when I woke up from shaking on the cobblestones.”Sagan sinks into the couch in a Maastricht hotel. We’re a week past Paris-Roubaix and it’s the day before he finishes fourth in the Amstel Gold Race – a 261km ride featuring 35 serious climbs – and the toll is obvious. Yet he is much more involved than he had been in a stilted press conference preceding our interview. As the routine questions from the Dutch press corps arrived slowly, Sagan quipped: “Is this a funeral?”Here, in a more relaxed setting, it seems appropriate to consider Sagan’s remarkable rise from obscurity in Slovakia to becoming the world’s premier sprint cyclist and star of the peloton. The 28-year-old, who rides for the German team Bora-Hansgrohe, became the first reigning world champion to win Paris-Roubaix since Bernard Hinault in 1981. This second classic, after Sagan won Flanders in 2016, sits alongside other milestones. Last year only a controversial disqualification, after Mark Cavendish fell heavily in a bunch sprint, ended Sagan’s run of five successive Tour de France points victories in the green jersey. He then won a third consecutive world championship in Norway.After that victory, Bradley Wiggins tweeted, of Sagan, “Cycling’s saviour! This man is currently bigger than the sport, look after him. Congrats Peter, a true legend and one of the all-time greats!” This gushing reaction mirrors the online response whenever Sagan pulls a giddy stunt – as in 2015 when he was John Travolta to his wife Katarina’s Olivia Newton-John and they acted out the fairground scene from Grease.Sagan reaches an audience which might not know the difference between the cobbled hell of Paris-Roubaix and the hilly agony of Liège-Bastogne-Liège. Yet Sagan can also be crass and, after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, he pinched the behind of a podium girl.It feels apt to linger over Roubaix. Sagan’s instinctive daring meant he accelerated away early from his main rivals and hunted down the breakaway riders. “It wasn’t planned. It just happened. I started to believe this year could be the year so I told Silvan Dillier: ‘We must work together because behind us are strong guys. If you stick with me there’s a chance for you.’”Afterwards, Dillier said evocatively: “Sagan is an angel and a devil in the same person – an angel because he took me with him and a devil because I had to go man-to-man with him.”Sagan nods. “A race is a race and at the end you take it.”He pauses when reminded of Goolaerts’ fate. “I didn’t know him personally. But it’s a shame and I’m very sorry. I don’t know exactly what happened but I don’t think we can blame the sport.”His victory was watched by his father and the emotion they shared sparked memories of their humble Slovakian past, in the town of Zilina, a world away from cycling’s heartlands. “My parents met at a restaurant where they worked as waiters,” Sagan explains. “After some time my father opened a small supermarket. It was still one of the bigger ones in our city. Lots of people came to us and we were also selling beer in tanks. But after they opened big supermarkets in Zilina – like Tesco and Carrefour – in two years my parents’ business was gone completely. My father opened a pizzeria next but they had to work very hard.”When I mention seeing people chortling at his internet escapades he smiles. “Oh yeah? That’s a pleasure for me. I’m happy.”There are moments when Sagan reminds me of Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He is capable of outrageous brilliance, amusing arrogance and sly wit – even if Sagan is a much more measured talker. He still once described himself as an artist. Sagan nods and points to a bland painting behind us.“For me art is not just a picture like this. Art can take many forms – even in sport. Look at motocross where they do triple back-flips in the mud and land without any issues. That’s art because the rider is doing something impossible for other people.”Sagan might be an artist on his bike but does he feel a responsibility to improve cycling’s battered image? “If you ask me how could I help cycling I would say by being myself. I want to make people enjoy life – because so many people have a hard time. Maybe some of the videos are a little ridiculous, like I’m a clown, but it’s fun. The Grease thing with my wife was my idea. I tried to be good.”I am curious to know what Sagan thinks of Froome. Should the four-time Tour de France winner be allowed to race while his lawyers try to clear his name after he was found to have twice the permitted amount of Salbutamol at the Vuelta a España last year?Sagan starts to answer but his team’s media officer, an otherwise genial man who accompanies him, interrupts. It’s team policy not to comment on the affairs of other riders. I try again and ask Sagan directly. “It’s not my responsibility to discuss this,” he replies.What about the grey area of TUEs– therapeutic use exemptions – as Froome insists his doctor advised him to use his inhaler more when his asthma deteriorated? Sagan shrugs. “If somebody’s sick then …”It is, however, an important area as Team Sky have been castigated in a parliamentary hearing for their use of TUEs and Wiggins, another British winner of the Tour de France, has been implicated. “I don’t worry about this,” Sagan stonewalls.Some cycling fans are worried about motors being hidden on bikes but, for Sagan: “If somebody has not been proved guilty then what do you say?”Sagan is amused when I ask about his infamous bum-pinching moment on the Flanders podium five years ago. “That was young Peter,” he laughs, raising his hands in guilt. “But she reacted really well and thanks to her for understanding. She did not turn it into a serious problem. But it was a difficult time. I thought: ‘What’s going to happen?”Why did he do it? “Maybe it’s my personality. I don’t know. I was happy I came second and I had my friends around the podium. One of them said, spontaneously, ‘Just touch her thigh or ass’ and I said: ‘Yeah!’ I didn’t think about the consequences. But you have to respect people – otherwise it’s anarchy.”Six months ago Sagan became a father. “Marlon is healthy. He’s laughing, he’s a good boy,” he says of his son. “It’s too early to speak about whether there’s been any change in my perspective because he’s still very small.”As his fame grows so Sagan’s world expands and in January he met the pope. “I was very happy to bring my mother to see the pope. It was her present. I also gave the pope his personal bicycle which was specially made for him. It’s not every day you shake hands with the pope.”Sagan is not the saviour of cycling. He is just an ordinary man, with an extraordinary talent, and so he smiles. “I think being the pope is much harder than being a cyclist. I’m not the superhero. I’m not saving people’s lives. I’m just a sportsman. It’s something I’m doing for myself and if people enjoy it then I’m also happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20e96e0d0735c548e74147fb4a5d7beab10c4ec5/0_0_2612_1567/master/2612.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5fc195ad9faf5551fa828418ffb01693 1240w","title":"iliza shlesinger review dating mating mars venus cliches","story":"Queen Elizabeth Hall, LondonThe US comic has charisma and craft but reinforces gender stereotypes with cartoonish vigour in a set that falls flatIliza Shlesinger raised hackles last summer when she criticised other female comics for their “low-hanging fruit” material.

None of the three gave a reason for their absence.The tech accord commits companies to responsible action in four key areas: strengthening defensive capabilities, refusing to provide offensive ones, helping customers and users defend themselves, and working collectively to minimise the potential for damaging cyber-attacks.Most important, the companies have committed to never launching attacks themselves. “The companies will not help governments launch cyber-attacks against innocent citizens and enterprises,” the accord says, “and will protect against tampering or exploitation of their products and services through every stage of technology development, design and distribution.”Kevin Simzer, the chief operating officer of Trend Micro, said: “The real-world consequences of cyber threats have been repeatedly proven. As an industry, we must band together to fight cybercriminals and stop future attacks from causing even more damage.” Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, has been the key force behind the creation of the accord. The executive has argued for months that the tech industry needs “a digital Geneva convention that will commit governments to protecting civilians from nation-state attacks in times of peace”.“The tech sector plays a unique role as the internet’s first responders,” he wrote in February, “and we therefore should commit ourselves to collective action that will make the internet a safer place, affirming a role as a neutral Digital Switzerland that assists customers everywhere and retains the world’s trust.”The creation of the loose grouping comes a day after US and UK authorities issued a joint warning blaming the Russian state for a massive cyber-offensive that targeted millions of routers around the world.“Russian state-sponsored actors are using compromised routers to conduct spoofing ‘man-in-the-middle’ attacks to support espionage, extract intellectual property, maintain persistent access to victim networks and potentially lay a foundation for future offensive operations,” the two nations said in a joint statement.That same day, US regulators banned companies from selling parts, software or services to Chinese mobile phone maker ZTE, arguing that the firm had violated sanctions against North Korea and Iran.Britain backed the ban, and noted that the firm poses a security risk to British digital infrastructure.

Her single-minded determination is a subject that comes up again and again when talking to her close – and very passionate – family and friends about her rollercoaster career.After an injury five years ago, Perri had to learn to walk again and switch disciplines from hurdles to sprinting. And this month, despite doctors and physiotherapists setting her chances of a full recovery at around zero, she’s competing as a member of Team England in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia.“She wasn’t so focused at first,” says Chris Zah, her trainer for the past 18 years. “When we started working together, I made her do everything from 60m sprinting to cross-county. She hated it, and didn’t see the point. As a kid from east London, she really wasn’t keen on mud.”Perri’s outlook changed in 2007, after coming second in the 400m hurdles at the European Athletics Under-20 Championships.“She grabbed me and said: ‘What are we going to do about this then?’” Chris says. “From then on, we agreed to think outside the box. I’d watch her competitors and say: ‘This girl gets to the first hurdle in 6.2 seconds, so you’ve got to get there in 6.1.’ She’d reply: ‘Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it.’”This attitude, along with her natural talent, pushed Perri to the world No 2 spot in women’s hurdles. But in 2013, she suffered a torn ligament and cartilage damage in her left knee at the finals of the World Championships in Moscow, leaving her unable to walk. “It’s when you’re at your fastest that your body is most likely to break down, and I’d just won two gold medals,” Perri says. “I tried to stay positive, but I went to some dark places.”Her family, along with Chris, rallied round to encourage Perri not to give up, even on her lowest days. “I used to be so frightened, I could only watch her run by peeping between my fingers,” says Perri’s mum, Norma. “I’d get so nervous – like it was me on that starting line. I’d tell her to run like she could see me at the finish line with my arms open. So when she got injured, it was a terrible time – I can’t put it into words. There were a lot of tears. It’s amazing to think how far she’s come since she was sitting on the sofa with her leg up, recovering.”Norma is speaking from LA, where she’s helping niece Jodie celebrate her 30th birthday. The pair’s enthusiasm for talking about Perri, who they call “the CEO of the family”, sees them scrambling to finish each other’s sentences.“We grew up together, so she’s more like my sister than a cousin,” Jodie says of Perri. “When she got injured I dragged her out to parties on her crutches. I told her it could be worse, that she’d bounce back. Now, she’s better and stronger than ever, and she amazes me every day.”Part of Perri’s fierce determination is a legacy from her father, Patrick, who for 14 years was one of boxer Lennox Lewis’s fitness trainers. “She’s passionate and competitive, and so am I,” Patrick says. “I’ve always been there in the background to guide her if she comes unstuck and asks her dad for help.“If she’s down, I’m a picker-upper, and I was there for her for physio and hospital appointments. It’s taken determination and grit to get past her injury, but having good people around you, that’s what gets you through.”In 2014, during her rehabilitation, Perri met her fiance, Mike Edwards, an entrepreneur and athlete. Welcomed by the family with open arms – “It’s like I’ve gained a brother and Norma has gained a son,” Jodie says – he helped Perri to connect with the world beyond sport during her recovery.“Perri had a strong desire to get back on top, but I wanted to offer her positive distractions and give her a bigger life beyond track and field,” Mike explains. “With my cigar business, I’d developed myself as a person and, in turn, Perri had achieved athletic goals I was trying to achieve myself. We really inspired each other.“After all she’s been through, she’s bulletproof. It’s great that we’ve been able to support each other.” Perri has come a long way – and as always, her family will be right behind her in Australia. “Everything she feels, we feel, so it’s like we’re all running that race with her,” Jodie says. “We lifted her back up as a family – and when she competes at the games, everyone will see what we see.”npower – proud sponsors of Team England and Jerusalem, their official anthem for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Who needs to stop aping Easy Rider? Here’s our rundown of telly’s sartorial underachieversIf your classic superhero is all about a telephone box transformation, Jones’s bandwidth is pretty jammed. Hence she leaves the leotards to the cast of Glow. Instead, she dresses in the kind of clothes that semaphore this is a woman who has too much going on to worry about where to dry-clean her cape. Sure, grey marl T-shirts, hoodies and the kind of ripped jeans preferred by Premier League footballers are never going to see her on best-dressed lists. But file her next to Mr Robot’s Elliot Alderson wearing the ‘damaged genius’ uniform.So much about Kalinda Sharma is all kinds of formidable. The PI skills. The shady past. The slightly suspect methods for getting at the truth. The constant notebook-as-accessory. But the fashion? This is a rare disconnect between character and look. The knee-high leather boots, 10 denier tights, fitted biker jackets and short skirts feel too close to something Presidents Club-approved to fit a woman who is anything but compliant. According to The Good Wife’s costume designer, the character has 60 biker jackets in her wardrobe. We would argue that is 60 too many. If a spin off was in the works (hey, we can dream), we’d advise a trench. Stan Rizzo’s bro-hemian role in Mad Men can be seen just by looking at him. He likes to spell out his allegiances in caps with his clothes. The Easy Rider jacket. The love beads. The beard. He’s all Cedar Tavern, waiting for a sighting of Dylan or De Kooning, getting wasted and picking up chicks. He’s the kind of man who puts a paperback of Last Exit to Brooklyn in his back pocket to impress. That is, of course – spoiler alert! – until Peggy steals his heart. He’s probably wearing something far more discreet now. There really is only one question when it comes to Chandler Bing, isn’t there? “Could he have any more sweater vests?” This is the man who immortalised the knitted garment, remaining resolute in his affection for the item for 10 seasons - we’ve never known such on-screen wardrobe loyalty. But it really is something that should have been marked up as: “What were you thinking?” He more or less single-handedly elevated its dad-factor to higher than that of even the anorak. It’s telling that even purveyors of the current dad-core trend chose to let it stay where it belongs in 1994 as it resurrected its sartorial bedfellows from the archive.There’s no doubt that Tahani, aka Mean Giraffe, is insufferable. Even before she opens her mouth, those floral frocks and blow-dries should send alarm signals – and they do to jeans-and-a-T-shirt-clad Eleanor Shellstrop. What self-respecting millennial dresses as if she’s ready for a garden party at a moment’s notice? It’s suspect in the extreme. And that’s even before we get to the picture hats. We’d like to see her switch it up and be more Jason Mendoza. We’d feel a lot more comfortable with tracksuit and sliders – and, let’s face it, she would be too.Don’t let the sheepish expression fool you – Gus isn’t Mr Nice Guy. In fact, as one culture site had it, he’s actually the “biggest asshole on TV”. Just ask the team he works with on Wichita. The real Gus is subtly there in his uniform of thrift finds: preppy shirt-sleeved plaid shirts and chinos. Sounds harmless, right? A bit ironically All-American? Wrong. Actually, that unassuming garb is the sign of sneaky overfamiliarity and economy with the truth. Even with Mickey’s influence in series three, and that cool military jacket, Gus isn’t quite what he seems.

For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija.

Roadside grasslands are particularly attractive to breeding birds because of their the abundance of clover leaves and protection from predators.Hundreds of geese have been spotted off roads in Gelderland in the east of the country and elsewhere. Others have been swooping down into the paths of cars and lorries, presumably seeking to protect their offspring. A stretch of road in the town of Opheusden, in Gelderland, reported four collisions in a week.Albert de Jong from the Sovon centre called for drivers to be wary, but insisted that it was for the government now to take the risks seriously and build infrastructure to deter the birds from major roads.“We have during the summer more than 500,000 geese and we are a small country,” he said. “That’s because we are very suitable for them. The junctions on the motorways provide small pieces of nature. There is grass, access to water, and they are away from predatory risk as it is too dangerous for the foxes. Geese are very opportunistic.“It is a dangerous situation. I have seen some just flying in front of vehicles or walking on to the roads. They are defending their territory. First of all we need to discover the areas where they are breeding, where this is a problem. We know a lot of them but not all of them. We need to make it less attractive to the geese. Drivers aren’t going to drive more slowly for them.”The Dutch government had said in 2013 that it wanted to reduce the size of its goose population back to its 2005 levels which, experts say, would entail the slaughter of 500,000 birds. The state pays tens of millions of euros to farmers every year to compensate for damage to crops caused by greylag, barnacle and white-fronted geese.Schiphol and Noord-Holland have been in a long-running fight for approval to gas thousands of geese in the area around the airport, one of the biggest in Europe, despite a court ban.A spokesman for the Rijkswaterstaat, which is responsible for road safety, told Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that it was constantly erecting fences to keep animals off the roads but that this was impossible for flying birds. “We cannot quite avoid that entirely,” the spokesman said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74fb414b85f91523bcf7755c30724c92b1f6855a/0_129_4823_2894/master/4823.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e6450cca6d129aa9897fdcc2916671d5 1240w","title":"macron gets backing from parliament in tussle with rail unions","story":"Poll suggests majority of French public back plans to reform debt-ridden state rail operator France’s striking rail unions face a test of their popular support after Emmanuel Macron’s bill to reform the country’s debt-ridden state rail operator sailed through parliament and a poll showed a majority of the public backed his plans.One in three high-speed TGV trains and one in four inter-city services were running on Wednesday as striking workers disrupted services for a seventh day this month in protest at plans to phase out the SNCF’s passenger rail monopoly and end jobs for life and early retirement guarantees for new staff.Macron, elected president last year on a sweeping programme of pro-business economic and social reforms aimed at liberalising France’s economy, has insisted he will not back down, and won a convincing victory in the lower house on Tuesday night when his SNCF reform bill was passed by 454 votes to 80. “Unions are free to do as they see fit, but a majority of the French want this reform,” the labour minister, Muriel Pénicaud, told French television. “Democracy is calling on the unions to find a solution that moves things forwards, not backwards.”Public sector workers, care home staff and students have been urged to take to the streets on Thursday as trade unions seek to build a broad-based movement of resistance to the government’s plans. Students angry at changes allowing universities to select undergraduates, which they argue breach France’s principle of free education for all, occupied the elite Sciences Po university in Paris – once attended by Macron – in the latest of a series of sit-ins, including at the Sorbonne. The militant CGT union has also called for strike action on the Paris Métro, with the head of its energy branch, Sébastien Menesplier, saying his members could consider targeted power cuts, causing more disruption.But unlike in 1995, when rail workers spearheaded a mass public-sector walkout that eventually forced the centre-right government of Alain Juppé, the then prime minister, to call off its reform plans, the rolling programme of rail strikes – two days out of every five – has not yet secured majority public backing.Ifop’s deputy general manager, Frédéric Dabi, said public support for the protesters was “relatively low: this is seen as one of the least legitimate strikes we have worked on over the past 20 years.” While the unions’ campaign was not yet lost, Dabi told Le Monde, there seemed at present to be “implicit public support, beyond his political base, for Macron’s reforms”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd673b1b51c09e2540fe115527a06191bd63bea3/0_27_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75fa8643351789ab5c1f2d04c5fb0ea2 1240w","title":"raul castro cuba step down leader miguel diaz canel","story":"Cubans greet end of the Castro era with indifference, not hope, as current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel is expected to replace RaúlWhen Cuba’s president stands down this week, it will mark the first time in nearly six decades that the island will be led by somebody whose last name is not Castro.The Cuban national assembly meets this Wednesday to elect the next president, and Raúl Castro is widely expected to be replaced by the current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel.The handover will mark the end of an era: Cuba without the Castros has been the holy grail for Florida-based Cuban exiles – and a policy vigorously pursued by a dozen successive US presidents. But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a new president were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised in an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/113b8ed6891824c910bf24a4bf94a5b7a21ea6d4/0_186_3964_2379/master/3964.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1056492c4e589683d3fad64e1677a147 1240w","title":"turkey to hold snap elections on 24 june says erdogan","story":"Turkish president says country urgently needs to make switch to an executive presidencyThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has announced snap elections on 24 June, more than a year earlier than planned, saying the country urgently needed to make the switch to an executive presidency.Whoever wins will be vested with extraordinary powers after a referendum last year transformed Turkey into a presidential republic instead of a parliamentary one.Erdoğan said he made the decision after speaking to the head of the Nationalist Movement party (MHP), Devlet Bahçeli, who a day earlier had floated the prospect of early polls. The parliamentary and presidential elections had previously been expected in November 2019.Erdoğan has established a formal alliance with the MHP to fight the elections, which made it hard for his Justice and Development party (AKP) to to dismiss Bahçeli’s call out of hand. “Even though the president and government are working in unison, the diseases of the old system confront us at every step we take,” Erdoğan said in a speech broadcast live on television. “Developments in Syria and elsewhere have made it urgent to switch to the new executive system in order to take steps for our country’s future in a stronger way … We discussed Mr Bahçeli’s call with our relevant authorities. We came to the agreement that we should approach this early election positively.” A failed coup attempt in Turkey in July 2016 was followed by a wide-ranging crackdown that has led to tens of thousands of people being imprisoned or dismissed from their jobs in the judiciary, civil service, military, police, media and academia – a purge that has gone beyond the alleged coup plotters to encompass dissidents of all stripes.The plot was blamed by the Turkish government on a movement led by Fethullah Gülen, an exiled preacher based in the US with thousands of grassroots followers.In a related development, Turkey’s parliament is due to vote later on Wednesday on whether to prolong the state of emergency that was declared after the failed coup. Parliament is widely expected to extend the state of emergency for a seventh time despite calls at home and abroad for it to end.On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspThe broad crackdown has polarised Turkey. Opponents of Erdoğan say he took advantage of the plot to consolidate his power, purging dissidents and persecuting critical media outlets.The extra powers granted by the referendum are not due to take effect until after the presidential election, and Bahçeli argued on Tuesday that there was “no point in prolonging this any longer”, citing efforts by unnamed circles to foment chaos in Turkey. Bahçeli, the MHP leader since 1997, is seen as a kingmaker in Turkish politics and has played a role in some key moments of its modern history. He precipitated the 2002 snap elections that brought the AKP to power. It has ruled Turkey ever since."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e46764ecac0ad5ea53cdea644bcdee83215fcc7d/758_165_2635_1581/master/2635.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8301fc9ecf450dca4a6ec3cb1cbf5417 1240w","title":"zimbabwe sacks thousands of nurses on strike for better pay","story":"Vice-president says all strikers fired with immediate effect in interest ‘of saving lives’Zimbabwe has fired thousands of nurses who went on strike to demand higher salaries, in a hardline response by the country’s leadership to growing labour unrest.The vice-president, Constantino Chiwenga, sacked the nurses in a terse statement issued on Tuesday evening, in which he claimed their industrial action was politically motivated.Patients were turned away from major hospitals after the nurses began their strike on Monday, shortly after doctors ended industrial action lasting several weeks earlier this month.“Government has decided in the interest of patients and of saving lives to discharge all the striking nurses with immediate effect,” Chiwenga said.He said unemployed and retired nurses would be hired to replace those fired.Chiwenga was the military general who led the ousting of Robert Mugabe in November, when the army briefly took control of the country and ushered Emmerson Mnangagwa into the presidency.He described the nurses’ strike as “deplorable and reprehensible” because the government had released £12m to increase their pay and allowances.He said the funds would now be used to employ new nurses.Zimbabwe’s nurses association said it noted Chiwenga’s statement, but the nurses remained on strike.Mnangagwa has vowed to revive the country’s moribund economy and attract foreign investment to fund better public services.“Government has done everything to comply with the demands of the striking nurses,” Mnangagwa said, according to state-owned media. “This leaves us with no option but to dismiss them.”Zimbabwe is due to hold an election in July or August, the first since the fall of Mugabe, who had ruled since independence from Britain in 1980.Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s former deputy, is a veteran loyalist in the ruling Zanu-PF party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce336712643553b02b346f4b06255c0040075960/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=5250\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e528a9f9964e906a14d9e802bc6db6ee 10500w","title":"destruction in douma latest photographs from the conflict in syria","story":"Images from eastern Ghouta taken after Syrian forces reportedly defeated opposition fighters in the area "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8edb61ad5c7191e98f8f5006611cdaa6f8bee085/0_0_1920_1280/master/1920.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=41bb4f79e301dfd490c31c98b1065c9b 2020w","title":"how to buy your first house","story":"Many of us aim to own our own home. But with buoyant house prices and stagnant wages, what are the steps to getting on the property ladder?If you’re dreaming of buying your first home, it’s not surprising. It will mean the freedom to put your stamp on a place that’s truly yours, but some say you’ll also save money. According to research published by the Bank of Scotland in February 2018, buying a home is cheaper in terms of monthly costs than renting, and saves first-time buyers between £590 and £2,190 a year around the UK, on average, depending on area. So how can you join them?How much you can potentially borrow will also have a bearing on how much you need to save. “As a very general rule of thumb, you’ll usually be able to borrow around four times your salary, which, if you earn £30,000, means a potential mortgage of £120,000,” says Wallis. “The difference between your borrowing power and what you have to pay for a property is the minimum you should save.”In addition, Audhlam-Gardiner suggests that a Lifetime Isa is more flexible in terms of the type of house you can buy: if outside London, the most you can pay for a property with a Lifetime Isa is £450,000, rather than £250,000 with a help-to-buy Isa (for Londoners the limit is the same as for a Lifetime Isa). Plus, with the help-to-buy Isa, the government bonus can only be used on completion, whereas it can be used towards a deposit or split up across the process with a Lifetime Isa. Finding the right first home for your savings is just half the battle. “First-time buyers can take years to save for a deposit for their dream home,” says Lisa Hardstaff of credit reference agency, Equifax. “But a lack of understanding about the mortgage application process – including how credit information is used – could push their dream back even further.” About half of first-time buyers take between one and five years to save a deposit, says Hardstaff. “It is worth using this time to get your credit report in good shape.” David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London \u0026amp Country Mortgages, agrees: “Ensuring that you are on the electoral roll where you live is a simple thing to do but could make a big difference. Having one or two well-managed credit cards can help, while having none could go against you. Regular use of payday loans could result in a straight decline from a lender.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Weekend cardiac care at University Hospital Waterford needs to be provided, say familyDenis Naughten to address D\u0026aacuteil at about 4.20pm on contact with INM lobbyistApproximately 200 students and 34 teachers at the school have been screened by HSE staffPro-Life Campaign makes claim as it unveils \u0026lsquoLove Both\u0026rsquo campaign in DublinSector has fears over labour supply and frictionless borders, Westminister committee hearsBailey loses appeal over costs of failed damages claim against GardaFreeing of Christy Griffin raises fears of third gang feud in inner city DublinOmbudsman had found some women who worked in laundries were treated unfairly by Department of JusticeThe on-going controversy over non-specialist-doctors in specialist positions has intensified in recent daysThe proceedings arose after Coillte got permission for eighteen wind turbines close to the villages of Timahoe and BallyroanMaynooth University programme to support migrants, Travellers and disadvantaged studentsInside Politics: No minister for finance can have enough in his treasury to satisfy all the demands of colleagues\u0026lsquoExtraordinary\u0026rsquo spending demands strike note of caution despite positive economic outlookCork County Hall continues to loom large on Cork landscape and in Cork affectionsShop owners say the ban is leading to a drop in footfall and could put them out of businessKevin \u0026lsquoBoxer\u0026rsquo Moran and Se\u0026aacuten Canney disagree over rotating ministerial postIn London, he played for those who dreamt of an idealised Ireland that never wasDrive towards better environmentally-friendly farming practices\u0026lsquoIts beautiful prose is put to devastating effect in his vivid story of the Irish potato famine\u0026rsquoThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3465630.1524053625!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach naughten did not release sensitive information over inm takeover of celtic media","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDenis Naughten arriving at the Dáil.

Plans by Mr Naughten to refer the proposed takeover to the BAI were relayed to Denis O’Brien two months before they were made public, according to court documents and reported by this newspaper this morning.Mr Naughten’s intentions, outlined on a private call with a PR executive acting for INM, were among information shared in nine communications that the State’s corporate watchdog has claimed may amount to “inside information” and potentially a breach of stock market rules by the company’s former chairman Leslie Buckley.Director of Corporate Enforcement Ian Drennan made his claims as part of his application to have inspectors appointed to investigate the company, which is being opposed.“It doesn’t appear to me that this is sensitive or confidential information,’’ said Mr Varadkar.Mr Naughten is to make a statement to the Dáil at about 4.20pm on the issue.Mr Varadkar said it might the case that a lobbyist, acting on Mr O’Brien’s behalf, claimed that it was, but that was part of what lobbyists did.“They often take information that is publicly available, or easily available, and present it as being confidential in some way,’’ said Mr Varadkar.Mr Varadkar said Mr Naugthen had told him about the matter on Tuesday evening.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said she hoped the Minister had full, transparent and credible answers.Labour leader Brendan Howlin said it was an extraordinary revelation that the Minister provided key information to an INM lobbyist, considering he refused to engage with the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) on that same issue.We send our newsletter out every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morningOur politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day in your inbox each Tuesday, Wednesday and ThursdayThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Passengers reported seeing a woman being given medical attention on the plane.“One passenger, a woman, was partially … was drawn out towards the outside of the plane … was pulled back in by other passengers,\u0026quot Todd Burr, the father of another passenger, told NBC10.Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers said their prayers and braced for impact.Investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane \u0026quotI just remember holding my husband\u0027s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,\u0026quot said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York.\u0026quotAnd the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\u0027t grow up without parents.\u0026quotMs Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.Passengers on board the plane wear oxygen masks \u0026quotEverybody was crying and upset,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotYou had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \u0027It\u0027s OK! We\u0027re going to do this!\u0027\u0026quotShe added that passengers clapped and praised the pilot after the aircraft touched down.Passenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask. He posted, \u0026quotSomething is wrong with our plane! It appears we are going down! Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!\u0026quotVideo: Passenger records mid-air drama on FacebookAfter the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.Ms Bourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.How the Southwest Airlines tragedy happenedTammie Jo Shults, a former Navy pilot, was at the controls when the plane made the emergency landing. She walked through the aisle and talked to passengers to make sure they were OK after the aircraft touched down.\u0026quotShe has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,\u0026quot said Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. \u0026quotI\u0027m going to send her a Christmas card, I\u0027m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.\u0026quotPilot Tammie Jo Shults was praised for her handling of the mid-air dramaIn a recording of conversations between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, an unidentified crew member reported that there was a hole in the plane and \u0026quotsomeone went out.\u0026quotMr Tumlinson said a man in a cowboy hat rushed forward a few rows to grab the woman and pull her back in.\u0026quotShe was out of the plane. He couldn\u0027t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,\u0026quot he said.Passengers struggled to somehow plug the hole while giving the badly injured woman CPR.As the plane came in for a landing, everyone started yelling to brace for impact, then clapped after the aircraft touched down safely, Bourman said.The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window.The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s incident.It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotA Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida.Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Family, friends and community leaders are mourning the death of Mrs Riordan, a Wells Fargo bank executive and mother of two from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was well known in New Mexico, where she had built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications after graduating from the University of New Mexico.Gov Susana Martinez called Mrs Riordan \u0026quotan incredible woman who put her family and community first\u0026quot and said her loss would be felt across the state.\u0026quotThe hearts of all New Mexicans are with the Riordan family,\u0026quot Ms Martinez, a Republican, said in a statement on Tuesday.Jennifer Riordan was described as \u0026#39an incredible woman\u0026#39Before starting with Wells Fargo in 2008, Mrs Riordan had worked for the University of New Mexico hospital system in public relations and for Citigroup.At Wells Fargo, she was the vice president for community relations and was in charge of managing employee volunteer and board service to nonprofit groups in New Mexico and parts of Texas. She also served on numerous boards and oversaw the annual United Way community campaign.Mike English, a spokesman for Wells Fargo in New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan \u0026quotwas a well-known leader who was loved and respected\u0026quot.Jennifer Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, had been married for more than 20 yearsAlbuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said his thoughts and prayers were with Riordan\u0027s family.\u0026quotToday, Albuquerque lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community,\u0026quot Mr Keller, a Democrat, said in a statement.Mr Keller said Mrs Riordan\u0027s leadership and philanthropic efforts \u0026quotmade this a better place every day and she will be terribly missed\u0026quot.State Attorney General Hector Balderas called Mrs Riordan a dear friend. \u0026quotI was honoured to work with her on financial literacy issues for over a decade,\u0026quot said Mr Balderas, a Democrat. \u0026quotJennifer was exceptionally active and passionate in working to improve our community, and I express our sincerest condolences to her husband and children.\u0026quotJennifer Riordan was returning from a business trip to New York Members of the broadcast community shared their condolences on social media, remembering the volunteer efforts and outreach spurred by Mrs Riordan through her many roles in the community.In a tweet, the New Mexico Broadcasters Association expressed its heartbreak over Mrs Riordan\u0027s death, noting that she was a former board member and scholarship winner.Mrs Riordan also served on the boards of Junior Achievement of New Mexico, New Mexico First and The Catholic Foundation.Ryan Cangiolosi, chairman of the Republican Party of New Mexico, said Mrs Riordan loved Albuquerque and worked tirelessly to help others.\u0026quotHer leadership in numerous charitable causes made a real impact on our state and earned her the respect and admiration of New Mexicans across the political spectrum,\u0026quot Cangiolosi said.Mrs Riordan and her husband, Michael Riordan, a former chief operating officer for Albuquerque, had been married for more than 20 years.A lack of oxygen above 10,000ft means cabins have to be pressurised to ensure those on board can keep breathing. When the seal is broken - such as by a smashed window - compressed air rushes out, as conditions inside and outside the aircraft equalise.Chartered aeronautical engineer Guy Gratton said plane windows are thick and strong but \u0026quotlike anything else, they\u0027re capable of being broken\u0026quot.He said: \u0026quotIf you lose a window then you\u0027ve punched a hole in the pressure vessel. The air inside will try to escape.\u0026quotFor anybody close to that window, there\u0027s going to be an incredibly strong wind heading out. It\u0027s strong enough to suck somebody out of the window, potentially.\u0026quotMr Gratton outlined a number of other effects a severely damaged window could have.\u0026quotThe pressure will drop and the temperature will drop,\u0026quot he said. \u0026quotQuite likely it will suddenly get foggy inside the cabin, it will be really noisy.\u0026quotLots of people will be getting popping of ears. The oxygen masks will all drop. That all happens in a couple of seconds.\u0026quotIn 1990, a poorly-fitted section of the windscreen of a British Airways aircraft blew off, causing the captain, Tim Lancaster, to be pulled halfway out at 17,000ft over Oxfordshire.Cabin crew held on to his legs and co-pilot Alastair Atchison made an emergency landing in Southampton, where Mr Lancaster was treated in hospital for frostbite and a broken arm.Two years earlier, an Aloha Airlines flight lost a section of its roof when a hole caused decompression.A flight attendant was sucked out of the plane and died, but everyone else on board was wearing their seatbelt and survived.Please review our commenting policyRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsWhat caused the Southwest Airlines tragedy and what are the risks of something similar happening again?Stephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainNikki Haley hits back at White House claims she is \u0026#39confused\u0026#39 over Russia sanctionsHairdresser sentenced to life for deliberately infecting men with HIV by tampering with condomsUN security team \u0026#39shot at\u0026#39 in Syria ahead of chemical weapons inspectionErdogan calls snap elections in Turkey amid crackdown on dissentLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchJapanese workers banned from lifts for 45-minute \u0026#39decontamination period\u0026#39 after smoking Former first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Meghan Markle joins Prince Harry as she begins work with Commonwealth youth group\u0026#39World\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 that takes two years to complete revealed - can you solve it?Queen \u0026#39hit extremely hard\u0026#39 by death of her beloved last Royal corgiDonald Trump reveals CIA chief Mike Pompeo formed \u0026#39good relationship\u0026#39 with Kim Jong-un on secret North Korea visitAlfie Evans\u0026#39 father kisses Pope\u0026#39s hand as he flies to Rome to urge: \u0026#39Your holiness, save our son\u0026#39On this day in 1909: Joan of Arc, French heroine in the Hundred Years War and national icon, is beatifiedFrom steak to aftershave to urine tests, how Donald Trump’s merchandising empire has collapsedChina warns it will do \u0026#39everything\u0026#39 to defend its sovereignty as it holds drills in Taiwan StraitUK enjoys hottest day of the year as country basks in mini heatwaveWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/18/TELEMMGLPICT000160774771_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq1otmVHALaTv2ghQ0pTDq-HpDg9BxLZzwDfiPKIQ2Cwk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"erdogan calls snap elections turkey amid crackdown dissent","story":"Erdogan has consolidated his power following the 2016 failed coupPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday called snap elections in Turkey for June 24, bringing the polls forward by over a year-and-a-half after a call from his main nationalist ally.Both presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on the same day. They had originally been scheduled for November 3, 2019.Erdogan made the announcement in an address at his presidential palace after meeting Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) chief Devlet Bahceli who the day earlier had urged early elections.\u0026quotAs result of consultations with Mr Bahceli, we decided to hold elections on June 24, 2018, a Sunday,\u0026quot said Erdogan.The move comes amid a crackdown on dissent in Turkey since the failed 2016 coup. Erdogan faced street protests this week as he prepares to extend the state of emergency that has enabled him to rule by decree.Bahceli stunned Turkish political observers on Tuesday when he urged the government not to wait for November 2019 to hold the presidential and parliamentary elections.Bahceli told MHP lawmakers that the elections should in fact be held on August 26, 2018.But the date announced by Erdogan is even earlier and will precipitate an intense and hurried election campaign as opposition parties seek to challenge the Turkish strongman.Erdogan shakes hands with Bahceli, who surprised many by calling for an early pollThe MHP chief\u0027s intervention surprised commentators since the government led by Erdogan has repeatedly insisted there will be no early elections.Bahceli met Erdogan earlier at the presidential palace to discuss the proposal in an eagerly-awaited meeting that lasted only half an hour, the presidency said.In a highly unusual move, Erdogan then made his statement in person at the palace, standing in front of a row of Turkish flags.The elections are significant as a new executive presidency - agreed in a 2017 referendum and denounced by the opposition as giving the head of state authoritarian powers - will come into force.The polls will also give Erdogan a chance to extend his stay in power with a new-five year mandate, after already serving 15 years in power as premier and then president.Erdogan has established a formal alliance with the MHP to fight the elections, making it hard for his party to dismiss Bahceli\u0027s call out of hand.MHP leader since 1997, Bahceli is seen as a kingmaker in Turkish politics and has played a role in some key moments of its modern history.He prompted the 2002 snap polls that brought Erdogan\u0027s Justice and Development Party (AKP) to power. The AKP has ruled Turkey ever since.Bahceli, who has led the MHP since 1997, used to be an outspoken critic of Erdogan but has closely aligned with the president since the July 2016 failed coup aimed at ousting him from power.Analysts had said that the state of the Turkish economy could have tempted the government to consider the early election call and hold polls before there is any serious deterioration.While growth in Turkey was 7.4 percent in 2017, double-digit inflation, a wide current account deficit and the need for debt restructuring at top companies could be harbingers of trouble ahead.Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the head of the main opposition Republican People\u0027s Party, said Tuesday he welcomed the prospect of early polls. \u0026quotAnd we will send them (the AKP) out,\u0026quot he said.Please review our commenting policyRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsWhat caused the Southwest Airlines tragedy and what are the risks of something similar happening again?Stephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainNikki Haley hits back at White House claims she is \u0026#39confused\u0026#39 over Russia sanctionsHairdresser sentenced to life for deliberately infecting men with HIV by tampering with condomsUN security team \u0026#39shot at\u0026#39 in Syria ahead of chemical weapons inspectionLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchJapanese workers banned from lifts for 45-minute \u0026#39decontamination period\u0026#39 after smoking Former first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Meghan Markle joins Prince Harry as she begins work with Commonwealth youth group\u0026#39World\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 that takes two years to complete revealed -

Justin Welby, will, as expected, officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding serviceAt 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle, who will receive new titles reflecting their married status on the day, will leave Windsor Castle by carriage, via Castle Hill, along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for their reception.“They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day,” a spokesman said.Guests from the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate with the first of two receptions.The second, for close friends and family, will be thrown in the evening by Prince Harry’s father, the Prince of Wales.A view of St George\u0026#39s Hall, at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will hold a reception after their weddingThe timings should go some way to allaying the fears of those concerned about a clash with the FA Cup final, with the football match likely to kick off at 5.30pm. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: “Prince Harry and Ms Meghan Markle are hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement. “They are very much looking forward to the day and to being able to share their celebrations with the public.”While the final arrangements for the wedding are expected to reflect the personalities of the Prince and Ms Markle with some unique elements, the basic outline of celebrations, as announced by the palace, follows tradition.Other Royal couples, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex, have also undertaken a carriage procession after their Windsor weddings, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge enjoying the same two-tier receptions following their 2011 nuptials.While their reception ended with an energetic Prince Harry rounding younger guests onto a minibus to continue the party into the early hours, the calming  influence of Ms Markle may see a more sophisticated conclusion to the Prince’s own day.After announcing their engagement, the couple gave an insight into their 16-month romance in a BBC interview - and described how they met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.Ms Markle told how she could not wait to say \u0026quotyes\u0026quot to the prince when Harry got down on one knee a few weeks ago as they cooked a roast chicken dinner at his home, Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace.Indicating the depths of his feeling for his bride-to-be, Prince Harry said: \u0026quotThe fact that I fell in love with Meghan so incredibly quickly was sort of confirmation to me that everything, all the stars were aligned, everything was just perfect.\u0026quotIt was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life, I fell into her life.\u0026quot Full interview: Harry and Meghan reveal engagement joyA few months into the relationship, Harry said he had to have \u0026quotsome pretty frank conversations\u0026quot with Meghan about how her life may change when she entered the royal family.He added: \u0026quotBut I know that at the end of the day she chooses me, and I choose her, and therefore whatever we have to tackle together or inidually we\u0027ll always be us together as a team, so I think she\u0027s capable... she\u0027s capable of anything.\u0026quotPlease review our commenting policyRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsWhat caused the Southwest Airlines tragedy and what are the risks of something similar happening again?Stephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainNikki Haley hits back at White House claims she is \u0026#39confused\u0026#39 over Russia sanctionsHairdresser sentenced to life for deliberately infecting men with HIV by tampering with condomsUN security team \u0026#39shot at\u0026#39 in Syria ahead of chemical weapons inspectionErdogan calls snap elections in Turkey amid crackdown on dissentLocal elections 2018 polls: Latest predictions on what will happen and key seats to watchJapanese workers banned from lifts for 45-minute \u0026#39decontamination period\u0026#39 after smoking Former first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92\u0026#39World\u0026#39s hardest crossword\u0026#39 that takes two years to complete revealed -

It\u0027s something I\u0027ve learned from.\u0026quotI owe a great deal to the whole reggae bass community.

regardless of their command of the English language.Even easier clues - such as \u0027Fuss about a large bear (6)\u0027 - are said to be \u0026quotsignificantly harder\u0026quot than those found in most newspapers, it is claimed.The crossword has even defied attempts of fellow compilers who described it as \u0026quothorrendously tricky\u0026quot and \u0026quotthe world\u0027s hardest\u0026quot.Marc Breman says his most difficult clue is \u0026#39Dishonest, short of getting further at King\u0026#39s Head (6)\u0026#39 because it \u0026#39relies on an uncommon usage of an obscure word\u0026#39Breman and his peers believe it would take the normal crossword fan at least two years - and possibly even longer - to complete it.Breman, writes an average of 13,500 clues per year and has constructed more than 30,000 puzzles since 1991.He said: \u0026quotI\u0027m not saying that this crossword cannot be completed, because of course it can.\u0026quotBut it is nevertheless fiendishly tough and significantly harder than anything I\u0027ve ever compiled before.\u0026quotIt was referred to by a colleague as the \u0027world\u0027s hardest\u0027 -

which he devised for \u0026quotfun\u0026quot - lies in its linguistic wordplay, codes and numerous hidden meanings.Its hardest clue is said to be \u00274 down\u0027 - Dishonest, short of getting further at King\u0027s Head -

Because crypto-assets know no boundaries, international cooperation will be essential.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But with economic growth expected to come in weaker in Q1 owing to the snowy weather, and the need for further evidence of rising wage pressures, it will be a less clear-cut affair than anticipated,” said Tej Parikh of the Institute of Directors.Earlier this week sterling had risen to its highest level against the dollar since the Brexit vote - $1.4335 – as expectations grew of a May rate rise by the Bank of England.Sterling: Warning of imminent slump against euro and dollarSterling suffered a record intra-day plunge against the dollar of more than 11 per cent on the night of the June 2016 referendum, falling to $1.32.In January 2017 it hit a low of $1.21, before recovering over the course of the year.Despite the pound’s gradual clawing back of post-referendum losses against the dollar, the trade-weighted value of sterling – which values the UK currency against a basket of the currencies of our major trading partners – still stands 10 per cent down on its level before the Brexit vote.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Remnants of those early planets have never been found.“Because we had collisions you should find some remnants of that,” said Prof Gillet, explaining what led him and his team to the Almahata Sitta meteorite.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceNasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

The committee is minded to issue a formal summons\u0027The suspended boss of Cambridge Analytica is facing an official summons after refusing to appear before a committee of MPs investigating the Facebook data breach scandal.The committee’s chair reacted angrily after Alexander Nix claimed an investigation by the information commissioner meant the controversy was sub judice.Damian Collins said: “We have taken advice and he is not charged with any criminal offence and there are no active legal proceedings.“There is therefore no legal reason why Mr Nix cannot appear. The committee is minded to issue a formal summons for him to appear on a named day in the very near future.”The refusal came as the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into the scandal was told that the misuse of voters’ personal data was “rife” during the Brexit campaign.A former Cambridge Analytica employee alleged that the group Leave.EU may have also used data from the insurance businesses run by its funder Arron Banks, to target potential Brexit supporters.It may also have broken electoral law because work was done by Cambridge Analytica that was not paid for and because data from UK citizens appeared to have been processed abroad, Brittany Kaiser said.In written evidence, Ms Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of programme development, said: “I now think that there is reason to believe that misuse of data was rife amongst the businesses and campaigns of Arron Banks.“If the personal data of UK citizens who just wanted to buy car insurance was used by GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for political purposes, as may have been the case, people clearly did not opt in for their data to be used in this way by Leave.EU.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“I have similar concerns about whether Ukip members consented to the use of their data.”Mr Nix was asked to make a second appearance before the fake news inquiry after telling it, in February, that Cambridge Analytica did not have or use Facebook data.It was then revealed that the personal information of at least 87 million people was harvested from Facebook by a company with a deal to share it with the London-based communications firm.Mr Collins demanded Mr Nix, who was suspended from his role as chief executive, return to be quizzed on “a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us”.Brexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a ‘fool’s errand’ by MPWindrush scandal ‘deeply worrying’ for EU citizens, says VerhofstadtHow Brexit is set to cause chaos at Europe’s ports‘People’s Vote’ campaign group calls for referendum on Brexit dealHe warned that “giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter” and urged Mr Nix to “explain” his comments.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”In her evidence, Ms Kaiser said she believed the number of people whose data was harvested from Facebook was “much greater” than the 87 million acknowledged.And she claimed Cambridge Analytica, which she left in 2012, had created several of its own Facebook quizzes designed to harvest data from iniduals.They included a “sex compass” quiz, which would tell Facebook users what their “personal preferences” were, and a “music personality” quiz.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There are so many things that have gone wrong,” Ms Abbott said of Ms Rudd.“She has information about who was deported and who was in detention, and she needs to make that information public.“This has caused so much misery and has ruined so many people’s lives – and there is so much unity in the House of Commons on both sides of the chamber about this subject – she needs to consider her position.”On Monday, Ms Rudd, when she apologised for the scandal, announced a taskforce to help the people affected prove, within two weeks, their right to remain in the UK.Tens of thousands of people are believed to lack the documents they need, under the “hostile environment” for suspected illegal immigrants introduced by Theresa May as home secretary.But Ms Abbott, speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, said: “I would believe that when I see it.”She warned that members of the Windrush generation were being rejected despite having tax records dating back 30 years.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

russia","story":"International chemical weapons inspectors\u0026nbspfinally set to visit\u0026nbspsite of the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.Theresa May says ‘element of surprise’ was crucial in Syria bombingThe development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.Syria bombing: EU ‘understands’ recent airstrikes but calls for ‘urgent’ resumption of peace talks“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.Chemical weapons inspectors have entered Douma, Syrian media says‘Very likely’ evidence disappearing from Douma site, France saysCorbyn leads debate in Parliament on Syria strikes- as it happenedMay defends Syria air strikes amid criticism over lack of voteTrump halts plans for new sanctions on Russia If May wants to help Syria she should accept more refugeesA vote related to the Syria action was already won by the government on Monday, though it was not on a substantive motion – one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Kenneth Clarke criticises Theresa May for failure to consult parliament over Syria bombingSpeaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel to the site on Wednesday.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has flatly denied that Russia had “tampered” with the evidence, and insisted there is no proof that chemical weapons had even been used in Douma.Douma chemical attack: Syria war in picturesDouma chemical

dangerous development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

The whole descent took about 15 minutes.It was reported that the passenger who died, Jennifer Riordan, was a Wells Fargo banking executive and well-known community volunteer from Albuquerque, New Mexico.She was reportedly on the way back from a New York business trip, where she had sent a tweet on Monday showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan with the caption: “Great business stay.” Her Facebook page shows she was married with two children.After the emergency landing ensured the survival of everyone else on board, Ms Shults was unofficially identified by passengers, rather than by Southwest Airlines.She is now being compared to Chesley ‘Sully’ Sullenberger, the pilot who in 2009 successfully landed a stricken US Airways passenger jet on the Hudson River, and whose life saving feat was turned into a film starring Tom Hanks. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

He couldn’t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her.” Passengers gave CPR to Ms Riordan, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, while others struggled to plug the window as pilots began a rapid descent before performing an emergency landing in Philadelphia.Passengers did “some pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances”, said Philadelphia fire commissioner Adam Thiel. Ms Riordan later died from her injuries. She is the first person to die in an accident involving a US airline in nine years.Her Facebook page shows she was married to husband Michael and had two children.In a statement issued to Texas TV news station WFAA, her family said: “Jennifer’s vibrancy, passion and love infused our community and reached across our country. Her impact on everything and everyone she touched can never be fully measured.“But foremost, she is the bedrock of our family. She and Mike wrote a love story unlike any other. Her beauty and love is evident through her children.”Before she set off, she sent a tweet showing the view from her hotel in Midtown Manhattan, captioning the photo: “Great business stay.”Jennifer Riordan was flying home from a business trip when she was killed (AP)Ms Riordan led volunteer work in New Mexico and built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications.Mike English, a spokesman for Wells Fargo in New Mexico, said Ms Riordan “was a well-known leader who was loved and respected”. Seven other passengers on the plane suffered minor injuries.Some of the 149 people on board said prayers as they braced for impact before landing, using oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling during the descent.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,” said Amanda Bourman, of New York. “And the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn’t grow up without parents.“Everybody was crying and upset. You had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, ‘It’s OK. We’re going to do this’.” Passengers clapped as the jet landed at 11.27am on Tuesday and praised pilot Tammie Jo Shults for averting a disaster.Shrapnel from the plane’s engine smashed through the plane’s window forcing and emergency landing (Marty Martinez)“She has nerves of steel,” said Mr Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. “That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card, I’m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.” Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed Flight 1380 was heading west over Pennsylvania at about 32,200 feet and travelling 500 mph when pilots were forced to abruptly ert to Philadelphia. In a recorded conversation between the cockpit and air traffic controllers, the pilot is heard asking for emergency services to be ready for the landing.Ms Shults, a former US Navy fighter pilot, said at the time: “Could you have the medical meet us there on the runway as well. We’ve got injured passengers.”Asked if the plane was on fire, she said: “Not on fire but part of it is missing. They said there’s a hole and someone went out.” National Transportation Safety Board investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane (Reuters)The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of “metal fatigue”, it said. One of the engine’s fan blades was separated and missing, NTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt told a news conference.Photos of the plane on the tarmac showed a missing window and a chunk gone from the left engine, including part of its cover.Mr Sumwalt said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. A full investigation into what caused the failure could take 12 to 15 months. “It is very unusual so we are taking this event extremely seriously,” Mr Sumwalt said. “This should not happen and we want to find out why it happened so that preventative measures can be put in place.”Pilot Tammie Jo Shults was hailed a hero by passengersSouthwest said the plane had passed an inspection over the weekend. The airline’s chief executive officer Gary Kelly said there were no problems with the plane or engine when it was last examined.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators would take the plane’s engine apart to understand what happened and will look at maintenance records for the engine.Southwest said Ms Riordan’s death was the first fatality of its kind in the carrier’s 51-year history.Republican governor of New Mexico Susana Martinez paid tribute to “an incredible woman who put her family and community first”, and said her loss would be felt across the state. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Others wrote “#Iambreakingthelaw”.Weibo, which is similar to Twitter in format, appeared to then ban the hashtags and deleted many of the 150,000-plus comments related to them.The company’s Nasdaq shares fell in value on Friday amid the controversy.In an update on Sunday, Weibo said the “clean-up” would “no longer target gay content”.Censors will “primarily focus on pornographic and violent material,” the social network said, adding: “Thank you everyone for your discussions and suggestions.” The company had previously said it was acting in accordance with China’s cybersecurity laws.The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, has not commented.But the People’s Daily, the official paper of China’s ruling Communist Party, also appeared to criticise Weibo in an editorial on Sunday. “Intellectually speaking, there should be a consensus around respecting other people’s sexual orientation,” the column said, adding that comparing homosexuality to pornography and violence and regarding it as “abnormal” would go down badly with the public. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Regulators have been ratcheting up control over Chinese microblogs in recent months, ordering platforms like Weibo to set up a mechanism to remove false information and criticising them for allowing prohibited material to spread.President Xi Jinping’s government has been tightening control over what China’s public can see and say online while attempting to reap the economic benefits of internet use. Homosexuality was legalised in China in 1997 and few in the country have religious objections to it. However, a traditional, conservative preference for conventional marriage and childbearing creates barriers for LGBT+ people. Following Weibo’s initial announcement on Friday, more than a million users have viewed hashtags in support of LGBT+ rights.Hua Zile, the founder of Voice for China LGBT, Weibo’s first LGBT-themed account, said he was encouraged by the widespread anger over the site’s censorship plan. “The response shows that we LGBT people in China are slowly realising our rights,” Mr Hua said. “Gay people who would not have spoken out years ago are now letting their voices be heard.” He said a Weibo manager had told him to stop posting while the “clean-up” was taking place.China’s Weibo will soon overtake TwitterHe complied, and his announcement that Voice for China LGBT would be going on hiatus was shared nearly 40,000 times. After Weibo’s u-turn, Mr Hua called on the firm to apologise to the LGBT+ community. “Like China, which has developed so quickly in such a short time, sex education in the country is a work in progress,” he said. On Sunday, an LGBT+ group of more than 100 people took part in a marathon in the city of Nanjing, holding rainbow flags to raise awareness of gay rights.The group had planned to take part in the marathon months in advance, but its organiser, Lucas Chen, said Weibo’s announcement gave it “added significance”. The main objective of joining the marathon was to “help everyone courageously come out of the closet,” Mr Chen said. “So it was meaningful that people online were also bravely speaking out and showing that they were not defeated by negativity.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
