In 2018, 178mm fell. In 2019, only 127mm fell.So far in 2020, Wild says more than 500mm has fallen on the cattle and wheat property.Photographs Wild took in December 2019 and then again in March 2020 show the area escape from a moonscape of rocks, dust and dry creek beds.“It was probably the longest prolonged dry period in recorded history. We really did get to a dire situation with a lot of these townships looking at day zero and not knowing what was going to happen.”Merenele is now run by a caretaker with Benjamin’s father John, 71, and mother Vicky, 70, living in the nearby township of Warren.Benjamin Wild, an occupational therapist and poet, lives in Lismore, but goes back regularly to Merenele.“I had a really strong affinity with nature growing up,” Wild says. “I was very much attuned to it. I used to collect seeds and rocks and fill up my drawers with all the junk I found.”Benjamin was born and raised on the farm with his two older sisters Julia and Kate, and older brother Tom.“It was just a state of freedom but, on reflection, it’s growing up in a workplace. Mum and dad were always around and I’d be out shooting or doing farm work. It becomes ingrained in you.”In a good year, the farm now runs more than 400 Shorthorn Charolais cross cows but by December 2019 as Benjamin returned for Christmas, they had de-stocked to 50.He remembers taking a picture as he entered one of the property’s main grazing paddocks, with a cow in the foreground.“That was a horrible day – hot and windy. We were out feeding all day and it was filthy. It would blow a dog off a chain,” he says.“That day showed just how bad it could get. Dad has been out there all his life and it’s rare that the ground gets stripped back to the bone.”The farm faced a bill of about $10,000 every six weeks just to feed the cattle.“The biggest commitment is just keeping everything alive,” Benjamin says.Wild’s photographs show the paddocks returning to life, and the creeks and rivers of the property and other spots close by filling with rain.Marthaguy Creek that forms the eastern boundary of the property was a place Wild watched black cockatoos and water rats play. He doesn’t see those anymore.“The saddest thing has been the numbers of tree deaths over recent years. That stands out for me.”Wild says the region has always had variable weather – with cycles of wet and dry – but he feels something has changed.“I feel like a tourist in my own town because I go back and see these extreme changes. It would always get to 38 or 40 degrees (centigrade) in the late summer, but recently it’s been getting up into the 45s and 47s for extended periods.“I hear the climate change denial in people, and I ask them when was the last time the Arctic and Antarctic was melting?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc34881fb1af8b088f6b978ddbd9ba892ac0b4e/188_243_3039_1823/master/3039.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=25ea15687eaf80a7e6f0b6cfc9fc8fbf","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

You’re right. He has reportedly been filmed entertaining an audience of rightwingers at a March for Our Rights 3 rally in Olympia, Washington. What form did the entertainment take? It’s claimed he sang a pleasant country number about coronavirus being a hoax and other hot-button topics, and managed to get the rather sparse audience to sing along with the lyrics.Sparse audience? Yes, the joke is that it was even more poorly attended than the average Trump rally.Are you going to give us a sample of the lyrics? You bet. “Mask-wearers. What we gonna do? Inject them with the Wuhan flu. Journalists. What we gonna do? Chop ’em up like the Saudis do.”Sounds like a riot. It almost became one when the organisers rumbled him – the lyrics were a little too outre even for the pro-gun, anti-federal government beardos of Washington state. Baron Cohen (who has yet to confirm it was him) had to make a hasty exit in a private ambulance. Uninjured, thankfully.What was the purpose of the stunt? As ever, he is being secretive about what the footage is for, but the assumption is it will be used in the next series of Who Is America?What’s Who is America? A satire show on Channel 4 and the US pay-TV network Showtime that got mixed reviews when it came out. How disappointing. You’re right. It’s just that so much was expected of it that when it aired in 2018, it was a bit of a damp squib. The show does have its moments, though, notably the sequence in which Baron Cohen, in character as Israeli antiterrorism expert Colonel Erran Morad, instructs the Republican politician Jason Spencer on how to detect terrorists.How? By putting a selfie stick underneath someone wearing a burqa to check whether it’s a real woman or a bloke with explosives.How did Spencer react? He bought into the idea completely. He also used the N-word, mocked the Chinese and exposed his buttocks when Morad told him this was a tried-and-trusted technique to repel Islamic State terrorists.I guess this hasn’t helped his political career. He resigned from the Georgia house of representatives.Any other infamous pranks? Morad entranced gun enthusiasts with the idea of arming a new generation of toddlers, known as “Kinders”, to protect American schools. Not to be confused with: Ali G, Borat Sagdiyev, Brüno Gehard, Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen.Do say: “Baron Cohen is a genius and a fearless exposer of rightwing propaganda.”Don’t say: “Yes” to an interview if approached by a man in disguise with a wobbly accent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2dfa1d12436d7f4064fad859a5f47a1e1c0bf1c/385_8_2006_1204/master/2006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df9dc270d6c002fa6078e7a401629d49","title":"how long is an acceptable time to wait before discussing spoilers avengers endgame","story":"In a new weekly column answering crucial cultural questions, we explore the etiquette around pesky TV and film spoilersSpoilers used to be so easy. First you watched something, then you discussed it with your friends, who were almost certainly watching at the same time, and then that was it. Now, though, it’s a minefield. Nobody watches anything at the same time, and everyone blurts their opinions on social media as soon as they’ve seen anything. It’s a free-for-all, and it’s untenable. This can only mean one thing: it is time to definitively locate the point when spoiling a film or TV show is OK.Clearly, that isn’t before the thing has actually come out. Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped an entire spoiler cottage industry from springing up in recent years. Some nefarious movie insider will post spoilers – sometimes the entire plot – of a film to Reddit, and these secrets are then disseminated online and into newspapers. Before you know it, everyone knows what happens in Infinity War and nobody has any fun watching it, all thanks to a mouthy berk on the internet.You should also be careful if you are tweeting while a TV show is actually being broadcast, because these days the live audience only represents a fraction of total viewers. Sure, if a show isn’t particularly high-status, you’re probably fine to spoil it like crazy because most people won’t care (so by all means tweet “OMG I can’t believe this guy on Traffic Cops was driving relatively fast in a residential area!!”). But if it’s a show you’ve been looking forward to, it’s best to assume that others who aren’t watching live will also be looking forward to it. Tweeting gifs of Daenerys dying before the final episode of Game of Thrones has finished is, and will always be, a dick move.However, there is a way round this, and we’ll use Avengers: Endgame as an example. Before its release, the film’s directors and stars relentlessly tweeted the hashtag #DontSpoilTheEndgame, asking fans to keep shtum about plot details until the Monday after its release. It was a genius move: at once raising the profile of the film, making fans feel complicit in its success and encouraging everyone to cram into cinemas during opening weekend. Increasingly, this feels like the best way to go. If creators can be proactive in asking viewers to keep a secret, it has a much better chance of working. That said, if they had asked for longer than a three-day silence, the embargo would have crumbled. So: when is it OK to spoil a film or TV show? The answer is after between three to five days, unless informed otherwise.However, please remember that spoilers are a two-way street. If you are particularly spoilerphobic, it is your responsibility to tread carefully. Assume that the thing you want to watch has already been spoiled and take the proper precautions. Don’t Google the thing until you’ve watched it. Mute the title of the show on Twitter in advance. Definitely, under no circumstances, visit any sort of pop culture site between the time of broadcast and the moment you watch it. Or it will be spoiled. I didn’t see Endgame until the Tuesday after its release. I know what I’m talking about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fabc6d3f405482414f6185d40b007eadda3cdd23/0_31_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=609db36619afa1c352ef81779671ab5c","title":"help springs up for uk graduates facing bleak job market","story":"Volunteering scheme and assessed virtual internships among initiatives on offerNew graduates facing the toughest labour market for 75 years can increasingly turn to innovative schemes set up to redirect them into areas of need.Last month the charity upReach set up Assessed Virtual Internship, a programme to help graduates whose career opportunities have disappeared. Two graduates have set up a volunteering initiative, Generation Help, to link new graduates with SMEs, with the hope that once connected a job might arise.There is also a push to build a national youth corps that would guarantee jobs for all young people. In an open letter to the government, a coalition of British youth charities backing the plan said: “Generation covid … face having their lives altered as no other generation since the war, with scars that will last their entire lives.”John Craven, the chief executive of upReach, said: “We created our programme at record speed to tackle the dearth of opportunities brought about by covid. We have offered the chance to apply to over 1,000 young people and had hundreds of applications already.”UpReach’s four-week programmes are delivered by volunteers from employers including Allen \u0026amp Overy, the civil service fast stream, Deloitte, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey and Slaughter and May, as well as team members from upReach itself.“Employers are aware that if they are seen to be cutting jobs they have offered for this autumn then the reputational damage could be quite significant, but it doesn’t mean they have to carry on recruiting at those same levels in the future,” said Martin Birchall, the founder of High Fliers Research.Gwenan Jones, 23, is about to graduate from the University of Durham with a degree in modern languages. “I’m so worried about the future that I can’t even think about it. There’s just no point is there? Each day I read about the damage to the UK economy that this pandemic is causing, how more and more people are being made redundant,” she said.Rachel Deakin, 22, is about to finish her PGCE at the University of Bristol. “I have been explicitly rejected from three jobs during lockdown because I’m too much of a risk, having had my placement cut short by lockdown, by fve weeks. Having specifically trained for this role and accrued another year’s worth of debt, this was heartbreaking to hear.”Zoe, 22, is about to graduate from a PGCE. She had planned to become an art teacher. “My future and the future of university students becomes more dark each passing day,” she said. “I am terrified to finish university even though I know what I want to do.“I am not hopeful that there will be enough job opportunities out there for us. Overall I have great fear and anxiety over my dream profession. I also have anxiety and fear of being made redundant from my part-time job at a supermarket because a job that was meant to keep me going through university is now the only way I have to make money for the foreseeable future.”Matthew Thomson, 24, is studying architecture at the University of Dundee. “The uncertainty appears to have dried up almost every prospect of finding employment. To get to the end of an unbelievably stressful year and see very few options is very disheartening.”Mia Stubbings, 25, is in her third year at Lamda, studying stage management. “I don’t currently have an industry to graduate into,” she said. “All my plans for my future have been taken away from me and now I’m left with a gaping hole.“It’s unlikely I’ll get a job in theatre until next year at least and even then the competition will be fierce. I’ve spent three years working immensely hard and and now I need to change my dreams and plans so I can pay my rent.”Charys Newton, 23, will graduate in September from a master’s in music industries from the University of Glasgow. “The live music industry has been completely shuttered by the pandemic and is not expected to open up again until summer next year at the earliest,” she said. “This means that by the time the live music industries are hiring again, my degree will be nearly a year out of date, and many promoters and venues will have gone out of business. My prospects of getting a job in this area are super slim.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75a1e1bb8b5788ebc719d1459d02bd5da037c4c9/0_0_4626_2776/master/4626.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=143eaf5aa611e563eb3976eea0b4caed","title":"rachel roddys eight rules of pasta plus favourite sauce recipes","story":"How much water and salt to use? Drain the pasta well or leave it dripping? It depends on whether you’re making this double tomato sauce or this courgette-almond pesto A few days after we bought our cooker, a book arrived in the post. The cooker was a secondhand Gasfire Cucina – identified by the man who came to service and fit it (a 40-minute job that cost twice the price of the cooker) as one of the last to be made entirely by hand before the factory was mechanised in the late 1960s. The book was In The Kitchen With Love, Sophia Loren’s first cookbook a surprise gift from a woman called Cathy Whims, whom I’d met at a lunch.A cooker and a cookbook: the two were already related. They were also both beautiful, singleminded, previously owned, smelled vaguely of well-done toast, and both special (one handmade, the other first-edition). Add to all that the proximity of their arrival and the fact that the book was first published the year I was born. Also, that Sophia, too, had a Gasfire cooker, larger than mine, with hub-cap-like vents and two ovens, and that features in three of the book’s eight colour plates so saturated with colour and flair, they seem to glow and throb. It is my habit to look for messages – in clouds, coincidences, song lyrics, the condensation on train windows – a habit that verges on superstition at times. But there was no doubting that there was significance in it all, and that Sophia, her chin resting in her hand, her elbow resting on a table heaped with vegetables and dry spaghetti threatening to slide off, was glowing and speaking directly to me.“Here are the rules that I want to suggest to you,” she writes at the start of the pastascuitta section in her book, some of which I don’t agree with – so I share my own pasta rules with you here.1 You need a large pot with plenty of water, so that each sprig of pasta can cook separately, free to move in the water without clustering. I never imagined I would be so dedicated to pasta, but I am, and putting on the water for it marks the middle or end of our every day. I have a lightweight pan that holds six litres, but as I am usually cooking 400g dried pasta, I fill it with four litres (one litre for every 100g pasta).2 Add salt (10g for every litre) when the water is boiling – this will increase the violence of the boiling.3 Turn the flame even higher to compensate for the fall in temperature when you add the pasta.4 As you add the pasta, stir to spread it out.5 Keep a careful eye and pay more attention to tasting than to the manufacturer’s timings taste and taste – it should be firm, but not raw.6 This is where is Sophia and I disagree – disagreement being a fundamental tenet of home cooking. She suggests adding oil to the cooking water to make the pasta more “mobile” when adding sauce I keep back the starchy pasta cooking water, which I then add back to the dish if it needs loosening.7 Careful draining. Again, I disagree with Sophia here, because it depends on the dish. For some pastas, dripping like Colin Firth as Mr Darcy emerging from a pond can be a bonus. Courgette pesto, for example, a vivid green, pounded sauce that owes everything to classic basil, pine nut, garlic, olive oil and pecorino, but replaces some of the basil with grated courgette and some of the (fiendishly expensive) pine nuts with almonds. Pasta dripping with starchy cooking water (helped by the addition of a diced potato) is required for the dish to have a soft swish, and to curl it around a fork. When it comes to double tomato sauce, on the other hand – a Puglian recipe via Emiko Davies, in which the pasta is layered with an olive-oil-rich cooked tomato sauce and a raw one also gratings of salty cheese – well-drained pasta is key.As is 8: waste no time in mixing the pasta and the sauce and bringing it to the table, steaming hot. Use the rest of the pasta cooking water to do the washing up – and to wipe the red or green splatters from the cooker, but not the book.400g pasta – I used linguine, but trofie or penne would also work2 small, firm courgettes40g almonds or a mix of almonds and pine nuts1 garlic cloveSalt1 big handful basil leaves100ml olive oil50g pecorino or parmesan, or a mix, gratedA small potato, peeled and dicedBring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta.Wash, top and tail the courgettes, then, using the coarse side of a box grater, grate into a clean tea towel and squeeze all the excess water out.In a blender or mortar, blitz or pound the nuts, garlic and a pinch of salt until the mix resembles a coarse rubble. Add the courgette, basil and oil, and blitz or pound again, until you have a rough, vivid-green paste. Scrape into a large bowl, stir in the cheese and taste for salt.Salt the boiling water and cook the pasta, adding the diced potato, too, until the pasta is cooked but still has some bite.Drain the pasta (saving some of the cooking water) and combine with the pesto. Swirl it around, and add more pasta cooking water to achieve a soft, swishy texture. Serve immediately.500g pasta (I used penne)Ricotta salata, pecorino or parmesan, gratedFor the cooked sauce500g ripe tomatoesExtra-virgin olive oil1 x 400g tin plum tomatoes, drained1 garlic clove, left whole but bashedDried red chilliOreganoFor the raw sauce300g cherry or small plum tomatoesExtra-virgin olive oilFresh basilFirst, make the cooked sauce. Peel the fresh tomatoes by plunging them into a pan of boiling water (save the water to cook the pasta later) for one minute and lift out into cold water, at which point the skins should slip away. Roughly chop, discarding any hard bits.In a large, deep frying pan, heat six to eight tablespoons of olive oil and fry the garlic for a few minutes. Add the chopped fresh and tinned tomatoes, a pinch of dried red chilli and a pinch of oregano, and simmer for 20 minutes, pressing the tomatoes with the back a wooden spoon or potato masher, until rich, saucy and to your liking. Pull from the heat.For the raw sauce, quarter (or eighth, if they are big) the fresh tomatoes over a bowl to catch the juices, add a good pinch of salt, four tablespoons of olive oil and lots of ripped basil, and leave to sit while you cook the pasta.Bring the pan of water back to a boil, add salt, stir, then add the pasta, cook until al dente, then drain.Spread a little cooked sauce in the base of a shallow bowl, add a layer of hot pasta, then some uncooked sauce, a grating of ricotta … Continue layering like this until all the ingredients are mixed, ending with cheese and some basil leaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08492731a37a19a6e290454f91773348daa75bb2/0_2040_5685_3411/master/5685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a3e6406f69e180c57d4e94e8c1b4391","title":"thomasina miers recipe for tomato and green bean spaghetti with lemon garlic crumb","story":"Green beans in a tomato sauce tossed with spaghetti and scattered with lemony breadcrumbs for irresistible crunchThis exceptionally delicious plate of pasta shows how, with heat and a little time, ingredients can be transformed.

It has been a turbulent week for them: one that began with a chastening 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium, and has taken in an injury crisis, a brewing storm between manager Sean Dyche and chairman Mike Garlick over expiring contracts and transfer investment, and a pitched battle against the racist elements of their own fanbase.And yet, at the end of it, they sit eighth in the Premier League: level on points with Tottenham, within touching distance of European football.A header by the captain, Ben Mee, just after the hour was enough to seal all three points for them here against a poor Crystal Palace. Truly, this is a club continuing to defy not just gravity, not just sporting economics, but occasionally even simple logic.It is, perhaps, a testament to the sound fundamentals of the club, however uncertain the future, however frail the squad. Dyche deserves plenty of credit for again devising a solid gameplan designed to neuter Palace’s multiple attacking threats. Above all, however, tribute needs to be paid to the players, and particularly the indomitable back five.Most of them were playing their third game in a week, and as Palace threw wave after wave at them in the closing minutes, their thirst for the grapple, the desperate deflection, the must-win header, the anatomy-threatening block, was again astonishing. James Tarkowski was probably the standout, but in truth they all played their part: a footballing brick wall that has allowed this modest-sized club to punch well above their threadbare resources.Again, Dyche was able to fill only five of his eight outfield substitute berths. Injury to Jay Rodriguez left Matej Vydra leading the line as the only fit senior forward, and from the off Burnley’s approach revolved around hitting him early, and then using their tireless midfield runners – particularly the slippery Dwight McNeil at No 10 – to forage on the second balls.Initially, McNeil looked the likeliest player on either side to create something. Quick, eager to roam and always showing for the ball, McNeil is the sort of one-man creative hub you so rarely see at the bigger clubs these days, with their all-star casts, their strictly delineated roles, their endlessly rotated squads (Jack Grealish and Wilfried Zaha, his opposite number here, also spring to mind). Most of what Burnley did well seemed to go through him.It was McNeil’s mesmerising run that provided the first half’s only real moment of grace: weaving past Luka Milivojevic, striding half the length of the field, and let down only by a weak shot. In terms of chances or indeed intrigue, it was pretty thin gruel.James McArthur was probably Palace’s best player, linking well with the returning Zaha and heading just over from Joel Ward’s brilliant cross.Overall, though, the impression was of two teams pushing themselves through the pain barrier, and determined to put everyone else through a similar experience.The second half began in an agreeably spicier temper. Jordan Ayew was fortunate to escape a red card after the VAR decided to take another look at his forearm smash on Josh Brownhill. Ayew himself was then punitively fouled by James Tarkowski on the edge of the area, with Milivojevic forcing a save from Nick Pope with the free-kick. But after an inert first half, Palace were just threatening to take a grip.Which is why the timing of Burnley’s goal was so crucial. It was another petty foul, this time on McNeil by James McCarthy, who had replaced Cheikhou Kouyaté at half-time. From the resulting free-kick, Mee ed in ahead of Gary Cahill and erted the ball brilliantly past Vicente Guaita at the near post: a header with the control and guile of a Van Basten volley. Perhaps Guaita might have done a little better with it. But now Burnley, whose record defending leads has been exemplary this season, had a golden chance to lock down the game and the three points.As Dyche seized the opportunity to add an extra defender in Kevin Long, Roy Hodgson rang the changes in attack. Andros Townsend was withdrawn for Max Meyer, seconds after putting one of his trademark left-foot scunners into the stand, and the hitherto ineffective Zaha was moved into the centre.Chances came, too: Milivojevic put a simple header over the bar, Ayew failed to bring the ball down six yards out. But saltily and heroically, Burnley held firm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42148bba4523b7f595688facfbe04b6687113dd5/0_120_3800_2280/master/3800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fa1af354a93adffd758cb724a593c03","title":"exeter city northampton town league two playoff final match report","story":"Northampton Town will play in League One next season, whenever that might be, and rarely can a win in this fixture have been so comprehensive.This was a brutal, utterly convincing disposal of an Exeter side who were simply overwhelmed throughout. First-half goals from Ryan Watson and Callum Morton always looked like being enough, especially when Dean Moxey was sent off, but when Sam Hoskins and Andy Williams added further blows it seemed a fairer reflection. Keith Curle’s side return to the third tier after two years away for Exeter, it is a third defeat at this stage in four seasons.Empty stadiums are a thoroughly worn topic by now but it was disconcerting to see Wembley Way, usually a bubbling throng of anticipation and angst at this time of year, deserted on a play-off final day. It felt like another step into uncharted territory and so did the sight of the sides emerging to a ripple of applause from club dignitaries.At least something about the past fortnight chimed with the end-of-season shootout: both sides had navigated typically topsy-turvy ties to qualify, Exeter overturning a deficit against Colchester while Northampton scored three at Cheltenham having lost 2-0 at home.A frenetic opening spell suggested the trend might continue and it duly brought Watson’s early goal. Northampton had already served notice that Charlie Goode, their captain, would hurl booming throw-ins towards Exeter’s six-yard box given the chance when they indirectly made one count.Although it was half-cleared to the edge of the area, Watson neatly moved the ball on to his left foot and drilled low past Jonathan Maxted via a slight deflection. Where one half of the national stadium would usually have rejoiced, the other gasping in horror, around 3,000 cardboard cut-out fans swayed in the evening breeze.Exeter’s contingent included a likeness of the Coldplay singer Chris Martin but it offered little obvious motivation. They were battered for the rest of the half, struggling to handle such direct, aggressive opponents and looking jittery every time early balls were aimed into their area. Maxted parried a Nicky Adams free-kick and watched as Vadaine Oliver, a towering menace at centre-forward, looped a header on to the roof of the net.A degree of respite looked possible when Adams, the influential winger, was withdrawn through injury but Northampton doubled their lead with the next action.Unsurprisingly it came after duels were won in the Exeter box, Scott Wharton nodding a long free-kick across and Jordan Turnbull helping it on. Morton, a striker on loan from West Brom, was perfectly placed to touch in.Before half-time Wharton, twice, Oliver and Goode all made Maxted work splendidly after rising highest. Exeter had simply not coped.Alex Bowman had squandered their best opening amid that barrage, losing control at the critical moment. Suggestions they had discovered some edge early in the second period were tempered by the fact that, as Morton showed by tracking back 50 yards to thwart a promising right-sided move, Northampton remained so much more intense.When Moxey tried to change that, he simply reduced their chances of a comeback to zero. Watson had just been booked for a foul on Randell Williams and perhaps Moxey, the 34-year-old, felt retribution was merited. But his tackle, thundering in recklessly as Watson sized up a pass in midfield, was vicious and impossible to excuse. It was the simplest of straight red cards for the referee, Michael Salisbury, to brandish.Morton slotted wide shortly afterwards but it did not matter. With 10 minutes left Morton harried Aaron Martin into an error, meaning Mark Marshall could blaze a trail before cutting back for Hoskins to convert. Any lingering doubts were eradicated and Williams then scored with his first touch, from another long throw, straight after coming on. It had been a meeting of men and boys."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925dad9029ab4f5f4086c28951fdd826ac0de87a/0_335_3203_1922/master/3203.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=5dbade63c61ea22d77e60fd975239801","title":"crystal palace v burnley premier league live","story":"Burnley moved up to eighth in the table after Ben Mee’s flying header gave them an excellent victory at Selhurst ParkPeep peep! Burnley move up to eighth in the table after an admirable, unyielding performance at Selhurst Park. Their captain Ben Mee scored the winner with a flying header, helped by a goalkeeping error from Vicente Guaita, and Burnley withstood a late barrage from a Palace side who didn’t really get going until the last 15 minutes.90+2 min Cahill’s flicked header is straight at Pope, who crouches to save comfortably. Palace have been terrific in the last 15 minutes and you couldn’t begrudge them an equaliser.90+1 min Another nervy moment for Pope. A cross from the left was punched away unconvincingly, only as far as van Aanholt on the edge of the area. His shot was saved by Pope, and then another follow-up shot was blocked by a defender.90+1 min van Aanholt’s corner is missed by Pope, who is relieved to see a defender behind him head the ball away.90 min McArthur’s excellent inswinging cross is headed behind by the backpedalling Mee, with Dann waiting behind him.88 min Ayew darts promisingly between Bardsley and McNeil on the left edge of the area, only to blast his shot out for a throw-in.87 min “When my dad was a panel beater in the 70s, he worked on a football scout’s car,” says Gary Naylor. “He asked him what he looked for in a player. The scout replied that once you got beyond Sunday football, there wasn’t much difference in the vast majority of players - except the ones with potential can do it more quickly. This has felt like a Hackney Marshes match on fastforward.”85 min Westwood’s angled free-kick is headed down by Tarkoski and half-volleyed into orbit by Brownhill, 15 yards from goal. It was a tricky ball to hit, although leaning back so much didn’t help Brownhill control the shot.84 min Burnley have parked the bus, which is an understandable if risky tactic. Palace are having all of the ball now.83 min “Amazon have gone a bit heavy with the crowd noise,” says Stephen Carr. “Close your eyes and you’d think you were at the Istanbul derby.”Wait until Palace equalise. You’ll be at El Monumental then.82 min Zaha’s driven cross-shot takes a deflection and spins over the bar.80 min “Go on Joel, make that run!” barks one of the Palace coaching staff. This is a decent spell for Palce, probably their best of the match in terms of sustained pressure. McArthur’s cross from the left is chested down by Ayew, but his touch is too heavy and it runs through to Pope.79 min: Chance for Palace! Ayew runs at Mee, who concedes a corner with a lunging tackle. van Aanholt takes the corner short to Zaha, whose clipped cross is headed over from eight yards by Milivojevic. That, by a distance, was Palace’s best chance of the match.78 min Zaha has moved to the right wing as a result of that substitution. He was ineffective on the left, where Bardsley and Brownhill doubled up on him.77 min Townsend tries a speculative shot from 25 yards. It’s a decent effort but flies over the bar Pope had it covered. That’s Townsend’s last touch - he has been replaced by Max Meyer.74 min Zaha gets away from Long and moves into the area, where Tarkowski comes across to poke the ball behind for a corner. Good defending, that. The corner comes to nothing.71 min The corner is only half cleared. Townsend moves the ball wide to McArthur, whose dangerous low cross is shanked behind for another corner by Pieters. Nothing comes of it.70 min Zaha wins a corner on the left. He has had very little joy against Bardsley and Brownhill. Before the corner is taken, Cork is replaced by Kevin Long.69 min Cork limps off to be replaced by ... nobody. Burnley are playing with 10 men while they assess whether Cork can continue.68 min “Not sure how you’re watching this, Rob, but your update about the goal came around a minute or so before it was shown on Amazon Prime,” says Colin Stevens. “Longest digital delay ever.”Ach, apologies. I’m also watching it on Amazon, so we must have very good wi-fi in Orkney.67 min Cork is down, and in considerable pain, after twisting his ankle while winning the ball in midfield.65 min Burnley deserve to be ahead, even if the goal was very avoidable for Palace’s point of view.Westwood curled a flat free-kick into the area, where the captain Mee launched himself in front of McCarthy and powered a header towards goal from 15 yards. Guaita seemed to have it covered as he ed to the left, but it went through him and into the net off the post. That’s a goalkeeping error.Ben Mee gives Burnley the lead with a long-range header!61 min There’s a fair bit of needle developing. McCarthy is booked for a foul on McNeil, who is accused of ing by Cahill.60 min Milivojevic’s free-kick is headed away by Taylor. It was smart thinking, though: he noticed that Pope was a fair way right of centre, to cover the clip over the wall, so instead he went to the far side.58 min Tarkowski is booked for a clumsy foul on Ayew just outside the area. 56 min “Looked a definite red to me,” says Will Morgan. “Ayew took a look at him then swung the arm. Bizarre, that.”I suppose he might argue he was trying to fend Brownhill off rather than clout him in the snout, but I agree he’s pretty fortunate. The more you see it, the luckier he looks.55 min Townsend cuts inside from the left and has a shot blocked. At the other end, McNeil’s errant cross-shot goes straight through to Guaita. The game is much livelier now.54 min: Chance for Cahill! I told you he was a good finisher, a-hem. A set-piece wasn’t cleared properly by Burnley and led to Palace’s best chance of the match. Ayew dragged the ball back to Cahill, who sidefooted tamely through to Pope from 15 yards. He usually hammers those.51 min: No red card for Ayew. That’s interesting. It could have gone either way, I suppose, but I think he’s a bit fortunate by modern standards of what constitutes violent conduct.50 min I think he’ll be sent off here.49 min It was a forearm into the face rather than an elbow, and it’s being considered by VAR.49 min Brownhill goes down holding his face after being fended off by Ayew, who could be in trouble here.46 min Peep peep! Palace begin the second half having made an early substitution. James McCarthy is on for Cheikou Kouyate.“I’m a huge fan of the ChampionMcCoist link-up,” says Stephen Carr. “So much so that I’m crowdfunding a banter-heavy remake of ‘The Persuaders!’ with Jon as Sir Brett Sinclair (Roger Moore) and Ally as Danny Wilde (Tony Curtis). It’s a ratings smash waiting to happen.”I’ve never seen an episode of The Persuaders! in my life, but you can count on my dollar. I reckon they could pull off a modern variation on Minder as well.Peep peep! Burnley have been impressive, with Dwight McNeil influential in the No10 role, but they have missed a few half-chances and thus the score is 0-0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8696d2635fbe8fd16712122d61ab9abdf103433b/0_147_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c5614cc7d78123fbcb68dafec502c57","title":"exeter city v northampton town league two playoff final live","story":"A brilliant, 90-minute performance from Northampton Town saw them thrash Exeter City to join Swindon, Crewe and Plymouth in getting promoted from League 2 to League 1Thanks all for your company and comments. Night-night. So there we are: Northampton Town absolutely demolished Exeter City in as good a final performance as you’ll see. They join Swindon Town, Crewe Alexandra and Plymouth Argyle in going up from League 2 to League 1.“We’re proud, as players and football staff, to represent them,” he says of the fans, and when a fan chucked a season ticket at him after defeat against Morecambe, he called him in and explained that “we’re on a journey”. And what’s he going to do tonight? “Have a hot chocolate, go to sleep, get up, watch the game back because that’s what I do.”I’m not certain his players will do likewise. Keith Curle says belief is the most important thing, and everyone at Northampton has it, confident in what they’re trying to do. He says he’s done it for the players, fans, staff and directors, then thanks his son, daughters and partner, who “make me tick”. Naturally, he then has champagne emptied all over him, then goes on to talk about the work, desire and attention to detail in the group.I wonder if Northampton will alter their approach next season. Ultimately, long-ball football can work, as we’ve seen, because you reduce pressure on your own defence and force the opposition defence to defend. There’s no reason to think it won’t work a level up, though if Morton isn’t there, it’ll be difficult.Keith Curle joins his captain to lift the trophy, and rightly so – this is his triumph, and he’s been so close before. He is a very, very happy man. The Northampton players collect their own medals, which is a shame – they could have fun presenting them to each other – and snaffle the champagne before it’s time.“We played out of our skin,” says Callum Morton, who says his team were quietly confident before the game. He reckons he’s developed as a player and always saw himself as a goalscorer, so hopes he’s proved that he is. He’s not sure what he’ll be doing next season – staying another season or going back to West Brom – but he looks like he’s got a lot to offer either club. The Northampton players are absolutely having it. It’s odd there being no fans, but they’re making the most of the moment nevertheless.Northampton have been superb, and fully deserve their promotion. You’ve got to feel for Exeter, but ultimately they were outplayed, outfought and out-everything elsed.90+4 min Talking of Goode, it’s not just his throw-ins that have been effective but how well his team-mates have used them. You can tell that they’ve worked hard and been worked hard.90+3 min Northampton play it into the corner, presumably for a laugh. 90+2 min Lee Hendrie gives Callum Morton man of the match, which I guess is fair enough because he’s been great, but when the game was in the balance, I’d say that Oliver and Goode were crucial. 90 min There’ll be four added minutes. What a substitution! Goode hurls towards the penalty spot and Smith flicks into the space behind the Exeter back line, Williams timing his run to prod home from close range. What a brilliant performance this has been from the Cobblers, the most complete final statement as I’ve seen in ages. 89 min Northampton win a throw, and Goode will have it....88 min Anderson and Williams A replace Watson and Morton. Morton has been really good. 87 min Have we any Northampton fans reading? I’m sure you’ve got more important things to do than talk to me, but I’m intrigued as to the vibe. On the one hand, you’re not there, on the other hand your team are going up and you’re proximate to a refrigerator.85 min Morton won’t let anything lie, and he dashes into space behind Martin, forcing the foul Martin is booked. 84 min Time elapses, as Northampton enjoy the moments.82 min Exeter replace Sweeney with Dickenson. It’s his big chance! 81 min This has been as good a final performance as you’ll see from Northampton, who’ve been focused, intense and absolutely fundamental from the off.More fine play from Morton, who controls on the chest as the ball drops, then scavenges for it when it looks to be running away, poking for Marshall, who screeches onto the pass then squares for Hoskins to sweep into the far corner. 79 min On Twitter, Jim White of the  has more Cureton gen: “The only player to have scored in all of the top nine levels of English football. Did an interview with him last season when he achieved that record and photographer got him to shoot at goal. He celebrated when it went in. Top man.”78 min Northampton are looking a little nervous, so are leaving Smith up and getting everyone else behind the ball. It’s pretty fundamental. 75 min Changes for Northampton: Olayinka replaces McCormack and Smith replaces Oliver, who’s been really good. 73 min The second half has been a lot more even, and an Exeter goal now would set us right up for an exciting finish. 71 min Martin brings the ball out like Sammer and gets caught, allowing Oliver to slide in Morton! This is the game! Maxted does really well to get out to him, but there’s space for yerman to jimmy around him or square to Hoskins. Instead, he looks to slot underneath him, and the effort bobbles just wide. 70 min Again, Northampton make hay down the right and Marshall stands up a cross for Oliver, who can’t quite apply brow to ball.66 min “Callum Morton is a Torquay fan,” says Chris Lintott. “Or at least he grew up watching his home team. Apparently he nearly came on loan to the Gulls but ended up in Northampton instead. Can’t say I mind now!”I doubt he’ll thank me for this, but I was once lucky enough to be in the crowd, watching our correspondent play University Challenge (one of my mates was the team captain). I’ll refrain from reporting the score, but Paxman was not amused and Gunnatillake of University College, Oxford was quite something. 64 min Again, Marshall scoots down the right and again his cross asks a question, Maxted responding with a clearing punch.64 min Good dashes across the centre-circle to rob Taylor before galloping up the left wing. He’s had a really good game. 62 min Collins has made a difference for Exeter, looking to get on the ball and keep it for his team. He was dropped following the semi-final, but based on what we’ve seen so far, should’ve started. His team have had 74 percent possession these last 10 minutes. 61 min Another change for Exeter, who are desperate now Sparkes replaces Atangana. He can’t have any complaints – he had a little conflab with McCormack, chucking an arm, then lost the heid completely and scythed through Watson. For a moment it looked like we were getting a proper rumble, but it defused all too quickly. 58 min Collins slides Law down the line and he finds Williams, whose low cross is hoofed away by Turnbull. 56 min This is a good spell for Exeter, who are having a lot of the ball. But they’re struggling to create and Atangana tries to force it, spraying wide to no one. 55 min Williams again makes space so Watson slides in nice and late. He’s booked.53 min Morton sprints onto a long ball, collecting beautifully then holding up well before unloading to Hoskins. He heads towards goal, before falling in a challenge with Atangana he wants a penalty, but the ref says not. It was close, though. 53 min Sensible from Matt Taylor it wasn’t working, so he’s given his subs a decent shot at making something happen. 52 min Double change for Exeter, Parkes and Collins replacing Richardson and Fisher. 51 min Williams on the ball again, squaring up Harriman and nipping outside him along the by-line, but his touch is heavy and he can’t catch up with it. 50 min Williams is doing his best to get his mates going, arcing a low right-footer towards the near post, but neither Exeter striker gambles. One of them has got to run across their man there. 48 min Morton holds up well and wins a free-kick, 45 yards out. Northampton have been really good from set pieces, and another, er ... diag is knocked back across by Wharton. When that’s semi-cleared, Watson absolutely punishes a shot that’s blocked at source.46 min Elsewhere, Palace and Burnley is 0-0, but Dwight McNeill is apparently being himself. He’s a lovely player, and you can follow him here. 46 min Exeter beat Northampton from a goal down earlier in the season – the only time they did that all season – so maybe they’ll bear that in mind as they kick-off the second half.Back come the teams... That was an extremely entertaining half (of football). Northampton were excellent and might be further ahead, but Exeter have the firepower to reel them in, if they score next. Join me again in 10 to find out what happens next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e575467cf54fa0214a606ebd3d1beb0c51f476b/80_319_3347_2009/master/3347.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfdcbd9e57ef823ab55468f74adedbf5","title":"balcony churches kenyans find new ways to worship in lockdown","story":"With no date set for religious buildings to reopen, an innovative priest brings his own brand of musical service to apartment complexesThe children hang over the balcony railings on Sunday morning, parents clutching on to their coat collars to keep them from tumbling over. In the parking lot below, a four-person band test microphones and practise harmonies.A moment later, the group break into an upbeat chorus, filling the Mirema apartment complex in Nairobi with music: “I’m happy today, so happy. In Jesus’s name, I’m happy.”The Rev Paul Machira, a tall, slender beanpole of a man with greying hair, leaps around energetically, encouraging the balcony worshippers to join in prayer. Sporting green overalls embroidered with his nickname, Uncle Paul, the 43-year-old has been traveling around apartment complexes across Nairobi, bringing his balcony services and Sunday school to families since the Covid-19 pandemic closed down places of worship in Kenya on 22 March.Machira has served at the 103-year-old Anglican All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi for the past year. He followed in the footsteps of his father, also an Anglican priest. Machira says he is dedicated to bringing the word of God to children, and styles himself as a “children’s pastor”.“I grew up always wanting to be the guy that makes children very, very happy. For them to really enjoy church,” Machira said.At Mirema Apartments, Machira and his band, which include a knockout female vocalist, an electric guitarist and a keyboard player, bring cheerful church music to an otherwise tranquil neighbourhood. Pairing dance moves with their tunes, the band encourage children and their parents to spend the hour dancing and praying together. When Machira realises that a crowd has gathered on the balcony of the apartment building next door, he shifts to a “360 service” to include those neighbours.The balcony church started when a Sunday school teacher at the cathedral delivered a service to children on their balconies to entertain them while they were stuck at home. The service was a success, and the teacher enlisted Machira’s help to spread this mtaani – “in the neighbourhood” in Swahili – Sunday school. While All Saints Cathedral has been providing online services for young people, Machira says the mtaani helps him reach more of them.“This Sunday school mtaani allows us to do ministry to children who do not necessarily go to church,” said Machira. “And children who do not necessarily have access to the internet.”Soon after its first Covid-19 case was announced in mid-March, Kenya closed down schools. “You’ll find children being confined in their houses from the time they wake up till the time they go to bed,” said Machira, who has three children himself. “It’s been a difficult time.”A night-time curfew and a ban on county-to-county travel has slowed down Kenya’s economy, and many of Machira’s parishioners are hurting economically.“Some members of our congregation have lost an income,” said Machira. “Some have been retrenched from their places of work. Others are in business. Business is doing not as well as it was before Covid.”Alexander Odhiambo, a resident of Mirema Apartments, has a two-year-old, Helen, and a baby on the way. Throughout the balcony service, he dances with Helen. The founder of Solutech Ltd, which provides custom software solutions, Odhiambo has seen his clients cutting their sales staff and even closing down because of the Covid-19 pandemic.Machira’s services are by invitation only. He says that the group have had to skip services because some of the neighbours have objected to “noise-makers” in their complex. Odhiambo decided to be Machira’s “host” in his block, but only after ensuring that all of his neighbours were comfortable with the service.“It brought down the tension,” said Odhiambo. “Even the adults actually enjoy it together with their children. Just coming out with family to fellowship.”Machira’s group have been booked for as many as four services in one day before. This popularity means that they sometimes have to split into two, renting an additional van and musical equipment to cover more ground. Machira and his colleagues provide the services for free, but it costs them in fuel and equipment rental.“The government needs to trust the church to being smart enough to put in place the necessary measures and obeying the guidelines as they restore the most needed worship in the country,” the petition, which so far has 29,000 signatures, reads.The government has assembled a committee of faith leaders to develop guidelines to help all kinds of houses of worship safely reopen amid the pandemic, but no reopening date has yet been set.While Machira misses the human interaction of his normal congregations, and wishes “churches never closed”, he acknowledged: “The threat of Covid is real.” The senior pastor of All Saints has had the virus himself and believes it would be irresponsible for the church to reopen until the pandemic has waned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4449164b15159b04d09d6f0159208ab6a663dd0d/0_126_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677d549b28f7372242702ab04131a96","title":"from promotions to gift cards how a great website keeps customers coming back again and again","story":"Customer loyalty is something companies crave, but how do they make it happen? Smartphone shopping, augmented-reality changing rooms, same-day delivery (perhaps soon by drone) – with so much innovative e-commerce out there, you would think that small and micro businesses were tooled to the hilt with technology. In reality, nearly half of UK small businesses lack even the most basic of 21st-century gizmos: a website.In recent months, consumer spending has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, but where money is being spent, it is likely to be through online purchases, so a website is more essential than ever if a business is to thrive. In fact, a survey for the website builder GoDaddy found that lockdown has prompted a fifth of micro businesses to set up an online presence for the first time, while nearly half of such businesses have boosted their digital and social media activity.Some savvy small businesses are tapping into this trend by using their websites to create additional opportunities for consumers to spend. Online promotions, reward schemes and e-gift cards are just some of the ways businesses can help keep customers returning.Promotions (vouchers, discounts and deals) are a great way to attract new customers and keep them coming back for more, as are contests, giveaways and flash sales. Meanwhile, free deliveries and automatic replenishment of perishables using a subscription model have become increasingly popular in the e-commerce world. Placing time limits on deals can create a sense of urgency and encourage uptake.Another way to spur bigger purchases is to create product or service bundles, or to cross-sell complementary items. Multi-buy deals – such as three for two – can result in a larger shopping basket too. And what about the customer who leaves your website without purchasing the items in their cart? A reminder email might entice them back.But be warned about heavy discounting, if it’s not done properly, businesses can end up reducing the perceived value of their products or services.Ultimately, it’s crucial to benchmark the results of any promotion against your regular pricing to see which strategy has the most positive impact on the top line.For small businesses, the prospect of running promotions can seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be if you know where to look. GoDaddy has created a suite of email marketing tools specifically designed with small businesses in mind. These tools let clients quickly and easily send out notifications about promotions, and even automate them to lighten the load.And to help you get to know your customers better – who they are and what resonates with them – GoDaddy makes it simple for its clients to create surveys and monitor the results. All of which will help you run your business in a way that bolsters your bottom line.Reward schemes differ from online promotions in that they encourage repeat purchases over an extended period.The added benefit is that your business can gather data on consumer behaviour and satisfaction, so you can tailor products or services to their needs. Your customers may also spread the word about your loyalty scheme and encourage others to join.For customers, there are many benefits – saving money and time, winning prizes, and early access to products, services or events. Communicating the advantages of a scheme is one of the keys to its success.Typically, customers earn “points” when they buy from you, refer friends or post about your business on social media. You can also award points for anniversaries and business milestones.Shoppers can be automatically enrolled when they make their first purchase, or can opt in via your app, website or social media channels. Customers then redeem their points to get products free or at a discount.Remember to take time periodically reviewing the performance of the programme. You can choose which metrics you measure – whether it’s number of members, or rewards earned or claimed – but it’s important to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and how to improve the programme.Digital gift cards could be the ultimate guarantor of customer loyalty during the pandemic. They’re not just a source of immediate income, they are an endorsement of your business from the giver and a warranty that you’ll gain a future customer. What’s more, they are a relatively cheap marketing tool that spreads awareness of your brand.Some businesses combine e-gift cards with promotions offering future discounts, which they hope will encourage recipients of e-gift cards to return and spend more.This makes sense as the cost of acquiring new customers can be far higher than retaining existing customers. And those existing customers are much more likely to try out new products and to spend more as their trust grows. This underscores the importance of a loyalty scheme for small businesses.Developments in technology might be moving at a rate of knots, but small businesses needn’t be left behind. Beyond the bells and whistles of drones and augmented reality, there is a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs.

Here, three businesses share what they’ve discoveredGiven the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the company’s strategy. “Chocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didn’t live near our stores,” she says.\u0026nbspThe company’s website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of “Knoopifier” chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the company’s strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.\u0026nbsp“While our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,” she says. “This importance will remain – the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.”For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, “chief toaster” at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasn’t really part of the business’s strategy.\u0026nbspBut when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. “We started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive – it’s become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadn’t thought about it as a sales channel and now we’ve suddenly realised its potential.”Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadn’t really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. “We had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped – it was a cliff-edge.”\u0026nbspLike Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.\u0026nbsp“At the moment we’re just doing local deliveries across the north east but we’re looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,” he says.When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand – a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.“I had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didn’t use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,” he says.“They do a free three-month trial, so there’s really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if you’ve got no skills whatsoever I don’t think many people would struggle with it.”At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an “amazing opportunity”, not just now but, he believes, in the future. “I would say that at current rates we’re looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around £1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Here, three stars of social share what they’ve learnedMost businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base – half the world’s population is now on social media – it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of “job done”, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.\u0026nbspBeyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and what’s important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.\u0026nbspBut as well as all this modern stuff – the basics are still important too.\u0026nbsp“On the high street you wouldn’t have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,” says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.\u0026nbsp“Social media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,” he says. “High-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.”The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people don’t engage and share your original posts then you’re missing a huge potential source of customers.\u0026nbspWhen Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers with GoDaddy.Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.\u0026nbsp“I just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,” says Plas.\u0026nbspHer efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.\u0026nbspThe first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.\u0026nbsp“I understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.”Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.\u0026nbsp“Some influencers get a bad reputation,” says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.\u0026nbsp“Influencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people don’t see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,” she says.Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether you’re filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.\u0026nbsp“Anyone can become an influencer if they want to, but I’d recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,” she says.\u0026nbsp“What’s the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting people’s lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?”Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand can’t be overstated.\u0026nbspThis is something Zaffrin and Brian O’Sullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.\u0026nbsp“Social media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,” says Zaffrin.\u0026nbspBefore setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.\u0026nbspThe stories the O’Sullivans shared weren’t all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.Once the social channels were up and running, the O’Sullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddy’s services – and they were in business.Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if you’re willing to put money behind it – paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is “one to watch”.\u0026nbsp“Our audience are our fans,” she says. “They root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether they’re letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

They now live in Honolulu, but are currently separated by the coronavirus pandemicAfter 10 years working as a merchant seaman in the US, Bruce James left his job in 1997 to move to San Jose, Costa Rica. He held a party the year after in October to celebrate his newfound freedom. “I met a beautiful Dutch woman called Julia,” he says. “I had a girlfriend at the time, but she stood out.” Several weeks later, he and his girlfriend attended a concert. “I spotted the girl from the party again, so I went over to say hello.” He soon found out it was a case of mistaken identity.Julia Piedra Gutierrez, who was from Costa Rica, was waiting for her date and had no idea who Bruce was. “I saw this American guy looking at me. He was wearing this horrible old leather jacket,” she laughs. “He called me by my name and I had to explain that he was mistaken. Then his girlfriend came over and also thought I was the Dutch Julia.” They laughed about the misunderstanding. “I was a single mum with a busy career, and I’d planned my first date in ages. When my date turned up, he brought his wife. Apparently, they were separating, but still friends. It was an absolute nightmare.” She admits she wishes she could have spent the night with the “badly dressed” American instead.In December that year, Julia and Bruce bumped into each other again. “We were in this smoky bar, and I went up to him to say hello,” she says. He didn’t recognise her at first. “I gave her the most horrible look. I think I’d had one too many beers.” Incensed by the idea that he thought she was flirting with him, Julia angrily explained who she was. “He realised and jumped up with such surprise that he accidentally pushed me over.” They spent the rest of the evening talking and laughing.Julia was impressed that he had driven all the way to her mountain home to pick her up. “None of my dates had ever done that before. He turned up in this old, noisy car, though, and I thought: ‘What the heck is that?’” But his old-fashioned charm worked. “He wasn’t like the usual men I went out with. But my friends kept telling me to give him a chance, and I found myself falling for him.”After several months of dating, Julia was shocked to find she was pregnant. Bruce moved into her home in San Jose so they could give their relationship a real chance. “There was a big learning curve when I became a stepdad to her teenage son,” says Bruce. Despite the challenges, the couple grew stronger. They married in July 1999 and their daughter was born in February 2000. In November 2002, they welcomed another son to the family.“We set up a business together building houses to sell, but it was hit by the financial crisis,” says Bruce. In 2009, he found a job towing oil barges in Honolulu, and they moved to Hawaii. “We didn’t want to stay for ever,” adds Julia, “so I started a women’s shoes business in Costa Rica so that we could retire there.” She is currently based there because of the lockdown, but plans to return to Honolulu in July. “I miss them, but I am so proud of how they are taking care of each other,” she says.Bruce adores his wife’s energy and her ability to make him laugh. “She always has a funny story to tell, and I love listening to her. I feel as if I won the lottery.” Although Julia never planned to marry again or have more children, it’s the best decision she ever made. “He is so calming and always sees the bigger picture. We’ve had so much fun, and I believe we are just better human beings together.”Want to share your story?

It’s very intentional. I remember spending a day in Stockport where some people were doing a citizen’s economic course – they weren’t economists, but they were interested. When you see the world through someone else’s eyes, it’s a genuinely enriching experience. I often think of the people I met years ago – I’m still in touch with a lot of them – and imagine what their take on something might be.I have an economics background so I have been trained to know that it is not a daunting subject, and people can understand more than they think. It is not an area that is closed off to them and it is so much more than the numerical. But putting a face to the story is important. When people think about austerity it’s hard to imagine just one or two people struggling – they think about society as a huge, overwhelming mass. Or with the production of iPhones, people don’t think about the Chinese workers putting them together. I consciously try to show that these are people like you or me – and they could well be you or me if there had been a couple of different rolls of the dice.In 2014 I was lucky enough to be shortlisted for the Orwell social evils award. I looked at Jeremy Corbyn and why he wouldn’t get elected, Apple and coerced labour, gentrification in London – a fairly wide expanse of subjects. In 2017 I was shortlisted but didn’t win. Every time I’ve looked at the Orwell shortlist, I’ve always thought the list of names is particularly formidable. It remains incredibly touching to be recognised in this way. In my teens I read all of George Orwell’s work and that has always loomed large for me, so to have that name waft over your name, like incense, is quite magical.At 16 or 17, I chanced across EP Thompson and the British Marxist historians and that decided me: I was going to study history. Decades later, they still influence how I approach economics. That’s often the subject of aggregates and means and all-else-being-equal, and what used to be called History From Below reinforces how those living in the same society can be affected entirely differently by the same events and harbour opposed belief systems and move at a completely differently chronological pace. When I was reporting on the Brexit referendum, those lessons kept coming home.And history and economics together – the study of slow processes and structures – form a very useful corrective to the breathlessness of news, its focus on personalities and its amnesiac insistence that what just happened is always of earth-shattering importance.Around 2013, I went to a housing estate in Barnet in north London. I wrote about it, as did Holly Watt when she was at the . There was old Ministry of Defence housing bought up by a guy who ran a private equity firm. It had great economic potential – it’s a lovely suburban area. One of the houses had been occupied by a group of anarchists, but with people from the estate coming back and spending time in the house. There were about 30 people there in total. They could talk about housing for hours and knew so much about how London was changing. These were not the sort of people who you’d see on the news, but I was pinned to the floor by the force of their opinions. They had been given short shrift by the housing association and moved into temporary accommodation where there was damp and insects crawling around on the floor. But you simply couldn’t pay for the knowledge and insight they offered. It’s a whole different register for talking about politics and we should be listening. After an Alternatives event we held in Preston, Lancashire, I went to a Sainsbury’s afterwards and I saw some people from the event having the debates all over again. It was remarkable and just highlighted how vital it is that we as journalists keep talking to our readers.I joined the  in 2007 as economics leader writer. I had been at the BBC – a fantastic news-gathering operation, but one that has to be fairly rigid about what is being broadcast each evening, because of the level of forward-planning required. The decisions that are made in a room in Shepherd’s Bush are the stories being discussed from Edinburgh to St Ives. What I love about the  is that editors will send you off to investigate a story and they will trust you enough to tell them what you think is interesting and worth writing about.I remember our now-editor-in-chief Katharine Viner telling me to go to Athens, when Greece was in dire straits, head to Syntagma Square, and just see what was happening. At that time, Greece was considered a lazy, corrupt country that had been living high on the hog for a long time, whose moment of reckoning was upon them, and this was being reinforced by the media. Because I had been allowed to go off and do my own thing, I wrote a piece that was completely different to anything else in the press at that moment. I met teachers who had top degrees but were working part-time in a phone shop because that was the best job they could get. I ended up going to a housing estate in Piraeus – a major shipbuilding town – and I met a former dockworker who told me about how his life had been since the crash. I asked him what kind of tensions it had caused in his life. He paused for a long time, and then he said that his mother-in-law lived in the flat below his family and she left her door open at night so they could go in and steal food from her fridge. Neither party ever mentioned it, but it was understood. “And for a long time, I haven’t been able to be intimate with my wife.” It was staggering to hear this candid story from a proud family man like him, and I wrote it into the piece. That night when I went back to the square, I saw students who had printed the story from the  website soon after publication, translated it into Greek and shared it on their own makeshift websites. These people fought so hard, but lost the battle anyway.Leader writers are often imagined to be comprised of what Larry Elliott calls “sherry corner”, and when I joined the  was pushing for some younger voices among its ranks. The banking crisis was unravelling in my first few months at the newspaper. There were so many changes happening around us. Later that year I went from Wall Street to Pittsburgh to LA to talk to people about Barack Obama and the state of the US economy, and getting the feeling even then that the craziness was not going to stop with the first black president. I went to a town called Stockton in California that had gone bankrupt and the mayor was working in a shop that sold balloons – I thought it was ironic for a place that been in a now-burst bubble.Then later, in 2015 and 2017, watching people who had never engaged with politics before getting excited about Corbyn and Labour. And then seeing so much of the spark that had powered the 2017 campaign and helped Labour hold Theresa May to a minority government – and how so much of the air had gone out of it by 2019. They had so many great ideas but these couldn’t stack up for people who were part of the so-called “red wall”.In 2019 I went to a former mining community in Derbyshire and found that the jobs were no longer in industry or mining, but rather in poorly paid social care or distribution, and they now had a Conservative MP. I knocked on one woman’s door and she initially thought we were canvassing for Labour. We got told to sling our hook, but we could hear shouting from inside the house and she invited us in to talk to her husband. They wanted to be listened to, and revealed how lonely they had become. I thought: “Here is a couple that has disappeared from the view of society, and the party that has always represented them for generations is no longer even talking about them.” I realised that in London, just a few hours away, there are young activists who are so removed from these communities outside the capital. It taught me that parties can change their leaders and their manifestos, but if you break trust and lose voters, you won’t get them back easily.I think it is marrying up the political with the personal. It has been really difficult to report during the pandemic. My natural instinct is to go out, meet people, talk to them, and hopefully arrive at a familiarity with them. When this knowledge is reported and fed back to the politicians, really powerful things can happen. By bringing in new types of information, you can change the discourse and break the feedback loops between Whitehall and Fleet Street. Over the course of the past decade, the  has done this again and again.I read some histories of the Spanish flu, which was the last great global pandemic. I realised that is seen, really, as a coda to the first world war, rather than being a hugely significant event in itself. When it got to Paris, it hit the wealthiest boulevards but it disproportionately affected lives below stairs rather than above – we have seen a similar thing with Covid-19 exposing “class” strata in society. We’ve also seen so many inspiring actions being taken by communities to protect lives and provide support for the most vulnerable. I guess the question we all have to ask ourselves is whether we want to go back to how life was before, or can we do better? I think the  has a big role to play in that conversation. It is our responsibility to illuminate alternative solutions to what the government is offering.I think we will soon be at a point where we need to reflect on the way the government said it was protecting key workers and the most vulnerable – the manifest failures, on the one hand. And also the opportunities that might arise from this crisis. We will emerge from this fog at some point and we need to consider how we should live differently, and what we owe those who have given so much – including their own lives.Don’t do what everyone else is doing. I’ve been a mentor to would-be journalists on the ’s Positive Access Scheme pretty much ever since I joined the newspaper and Joseph Harker press-ganged me into it, and the biggest trend I have noticed is 21-year-olds wanting to write comment pieces about Venezuela or Corbyn. Don’t do that. There’s already a giant slagheap of surplus comment, especially first-person comment. Where our media – and our democracy – suffers a deficit is reporting. I try and use my column to find stuff out and expose it, on housing scandals or corporate abuses. I would far rather read your fact finding on the asylum system in this pandemic or how temp agencies work than your collected tweets on Donald Trump.We are lucky to have a newsroom that is so much more erse than the ones I trained in – and still so much more so than a lot of our competitors. We’ve got a long way to go, but it feels so wonderfully different to write alongside people who might not have had a chance at another paper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ecd4beae976d6cdedd2b846e0cf5cf3e6b1f79c/0_64_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3212df302b8a245869b2784b9ffd8492","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”.   columnist John Harris has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster.

Now a new telescope could confirm their belief and change solar system scienceYou’d think that if you found the first evidence that a planet larger than the Earth was lurking unseen in the furthest reaches of our solar system, it would be a big moment. It would make you one of only a small handful of people in all of history to have discovered such a thing.But for astronomer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC, it was a much quieter affair. “It wasn’t like there was a eureka moment,” he says. “The evidence just built up slowly.”He’s a master of understatement. Ever since he and his collaborator Chad Trujillo of Northern Arizona University, first published their suspicions about the unseen planet in 2014, the evidence has only continued to grow. Yet when asked how convinced he is that the new world, which he calls Planet X (though many other astronomers call it Planet 9), is really out there, Sheppard will only say: “I think it’s more likely than unlikely to exist.”As for the rest of the astronomical community, in most quarters there is a palpable excitement about finding this world. Much of this excitement centres on the opening of a giant new survey telescope named after Vera C Rubin, the astronomer who, in the 1970s, discovered some of the first evidence for dark matter.Scheduled to begin its full survey of the sky in 2022, the Rubin observatory could find the planet outright or provide the clinching circumstantial evidence that it’s there.Discovery of the planet would be a triumph, but also a disaster for existing theory about how the solar system was created.“It would change everything we thought we knew about planet formation,” says Sheppard, in another characteristic understatement. In truth, no one has a clue how such a large planet could form that far from the sun.The distant solar system is a place of darkness and mystery. It encompasses an enormous volume of space that begins at the orbit of Neptune, some 30 times further from the sun than Earth, or 30 astronomical units (AU)the , and extends to about 100,000AU. That’s almost one-third of the distance from the sun to the next nearest star.It was in the inner regions of this volume that American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto in 1930. Although Pluto possessed just two-thirds of the diameter of our moon, it was originally classed as a planet.By the end of the century, however, telescopes were bigger and astronomers were beginning to find more tiny worlds beyond Neptune. They were all even smaller than Pluto until 2005, when Mike Brown from the California Institute of Technology discovered Eris. It was at least the same size as Pluto and probably bigger, so, if Pluto was a planet, so was Eris. Nasa hastily organised a press conference and announced the discovery of Planet 10.About a year later, the International Astronomical Union ruled that Pluto and Eris were effectively too small to be called planets and renamed them dwarf planets. So the solar system’s roll-call returned to eight: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. And a cottage industry of finding distant solar system objects really got going.The path towards Planet 9 began one night in 2012, when Sheppard and Trujillo were using the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory’s telescope in Chile. They were finding more and more distant objects, but one in particular stood out. Catalogued as 2012 VP113, they nicknamed it Biden after the US vice-president at the time (because of the letters VP in the catalogue designation). To their amazement, this far-flung world never came closer to the sun than about 80AU. At its furthest, Biden would reach 440AU into deep space, meaning that it followed a highly elliptical orbit. But that wasn’t the most remarkable thing about it.By some weird coincidence, its orbit appeared to be very similar to that of another distant world known as Sedna. This mini-world had been discovered in 2003 by Brown, Trujillo and David Rabinowitz of Yale University. It immediately stood out because of its highly elliptical orbit, which swings from 76AU to 937AU.“Objects like Sedna and 2012 VP113 can’t form on these eccentric orbits,” says Sheppard. Instead, computer simulations suggest that they form much closer and are then ejected by gravitational interactions with the larger planets. The truly odd thing, however, was that the two elongated orbits pointed in roughly the same direction.And the more Sheppard and Trujillo examined the other objects in their catch, the more they saw that those orbits were aligned, too. It was as if something was corralling those tiny worlds, like a sheepdog manoeuvring its flock. And the only thing they could think of that was capable of doing that was a much larger planet.Curiosity piqued, they did some calculations and discovered that the planet their results were hinting at had to be somewhere between two and 15 times more massive than Earth, on an orbit that lies on average somewhere between 250AU and 1500AU from the sun. Their results were published by the prestigious journal Nature in March 2014 and interest in Planet 9 began to sweep the astronomical world.The next big leap came in 2015 when Sheppard and Trujillo were among the scientists who discovered 2015 TG387. They nicknamed this one the Goblin. It’s the third most extreme object behind Sedna and Biden and it, too, lines up, reducing still further the idea that this alignment is a random coincidence.In 2016, Brown and his collaborator Konstantin Batygin, also of Caltech, published their own analysis of the data. Agreeing with Sheppard and Trujillo about the size and distance of the planet, they even suggested an area of sky where they thought it might be found.But not everyone is convinced.Pedro H Bernardinelli, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, realised that Sheppard’s data wasn’t the only place one could look for distant worldlets. So he turned to some initial data from a cosmological survey that was designed to measure the way in which the universe is expanding by looking at far-away galaxies. He searched the data for the celestial equivalent of a photobomb, looking for distant solar system objects that just happened to get in the way of the camera. He found seven.At first sight, it looked as if these worldlets were also aligned as expected, but the more rigorously Bernardinelli analysed the data, the weaker he felt the alignment became. “We don’t think we see the signal in our data,” says Bernardinelli, although he admits the he can’t yet definitely rule out the planet and has yet to run the analysis on the full survey data. “Our answer might change the next time we do this,” he says.These days, Sheppard can regularly be found using Japan’s Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, patiently scouring the sky for more evidence of Planet 9, maybe even hoping that he sees the planet itself. The scale of the task is enormous. It really is like looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. The planet – if it is even there – is very faint and the sky is very large. But help is on its way in the form of the Rubin observatory.Rubin is a monster that will devour the sky. Whereas most telescopes would take months or years to survey the whole sky, Rubin will do it in just three nights. Then do it again and again and again to see what’s changed and so catch the moving objects.Construction is nearing completion, and the telescope is set to open its giant eye for the first time later this year. Commissioning and tweaking will then take another couple of years.“That survey is going to change solar system science as we know it,” says Sheppard. And if Planet 9 is out there, Rubin should see it.“We can detect an Earth-mass planet at around 1000 AU,” says Meg Schwamb, of Queen’s University Belfast, who co-chairs the Rubin observatory’s solar system science collaboration. That puts Sheppard’s world easily within its sights. “If others haven’t seen Planet 9 before our survey starts then, I think, all eyes are on the Rubin observatory,” says Schwamb.Even if the telescope fails to see the planet directly, it will detect many more distant mini-worlds that can all be use to triangulate the planet’s position more precisely, thus helping to narrow the search area. And if Planet 9 really is out there, then the consequences will be huge. Astronomers think that the solar system formed in a disc of matter surrounding the sun. That matter condensed into smaller bodies, which then collided to form larger ones. At the end of this process, the planets were born. But the matter in this disc thins out further from the sun, meaning there is not enough raw material to form a large planet in the distant solar system.To rescue the standard theory, some suggest that Planet 9 was once destined to become a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn and so was forming alongside them. However, a gravitational interaction stunted its growth by hurling it out into the dark.But Jakub Scholtz of Durham University is sceptical. “It’s possible,” he says, “but it actually requires quite a lot of coincidences.” That’s because a single gravitational interaction can’t do the job. Instead, a series of interactions is needed to place it in an orbit that never brings it back to where it formed.Scholtz has a more exotic idea. Together with collaborator James Unwin, of the University of Illinois at Chicago, he has suggested that the object corralling these distant worldlets is not a long-lost planet but a black hole.If so, not even Rubin will be able to see it, because black holes emit no light whatsoever – they simply swallow light and anything else that happens to cross their path. It is a tantalising possibility because Scholtz’s black hole would have to be part of a long-suspected but never-proved population of black holes that were formed shortly after the formation of the universe.But for the time being, most other astronomers seem more than content with the idea that there’s a large planet out there in the darkness, just waiting to come into view in the next few years.And if Planet 9 really is there, then perhaps the first time Sheppard sees it through a telescope, he will finally experience something akin to a eureka moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cd5a3e48760105b1209d9e88aa208e5add9ed7a/0_38_2340_1404/master/2340.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=936bce4a798e78dac2f3bf98dfb37b88","title":"did you solve it the broken vase","story":"The shattering solutions to today’s puzzlesEarlier today I set the following three puzzles:1.

Volcanic eruptions have previously been found to have driven other mass extinctions, including the end-Permian mass extinction.Still others have suggested the two acted together, possibly with the asteroid the last straw after a long period of instability caused by volcanic activity.Now researchers say they have unpicked the mystery by modelling the ecological effects of the different possibilities.Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Chiarenza and colleagues report how they built models to explore how the different disasters would have affected the planet’s climate and, crucially, the habitats in which dinosaurs lived, from tyrannosaurs to the armoured ankylosaurs.In fact the team suggest that rather than wiping out life, the pulses of global warming resulting from carbon dioxide released from the volcanoes could have buffered the cooling from the asteroid strike and helped life recover – although the fate of the non-avian dinosaurs would have remained the same.The team say the findings tie in with other research, including fossil evidence from the Deccan that animals including dinosaurs survived previous high-intensity eruptions, and findings suggesting the mass extinction was a sudden event.But Chiarenza said he expected debate to continue, adding proponents of the volcanism theory were likely to push back. “I am pretty sure these guys will not take it easily,” he said.Gerta Keller, professor of palaeontology and geology at Princeton University, who was not involved in the work, criticised the research saying it ignored evidence from recent Deccan volcanism studies, including findings showing the largest volcanic eruption pulse coincided with the mass extinction.“When the basic assumptions of a study are based on cherry-picked data, the results are predictable and wrong,” she said. However, Steve Brusatte, professor of palaeontology and evolution at the University of Edinburgh, said the study was elegant and convincing.“It adds overwhelming evidence that the asteroid was the culprit, full stop,” he said. “Not only that, but it specifically targets one aspect of the asteroid’s arsenal of weapons as the one that felled the dinosaurs: it was the nuclear winter that fell after the dust and grime from the asteroid blocked out the sun for several years.”“It does, though, seem that volcanoes played a role, just not the one many of us suspected: they played a mitigating role,” he added.Brusatte said, he too, expected debate to continue. “But with each new study, and now especially with this outstanding piece of work, it becomes harder and harder to entertain anything other than the asteroid,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c7981cfe396262a5ebc4bad5074b9d45049e72d/0_170_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=655a2346cb2bfe46d1d598f5afd59cb2","title":"uk benefit sanctions to return as jobcentres reopen after lockdown","story":"Labour condemns move to restore claimant conditionality rules as ‘incomprehensible’The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, has indicated benefit sanctions will be reintroduced this week as jobcentres in England start to reopen after lockdown, saying it is important claimant rules are reinstated.Face-to-face meetings in jobcentres were suspended in March, and with them the system of “claimant conditionality” – a set of rules that require people to agree to carry out job search activities as a condition of claiming benefits.Speaking in the House of Commons, Coffey refused to extend the arrangements after the three-month period finished on Tuesday. “It’s important that as the jobcentres fully reopen this week, we do reinstate the need for having a claimant commitment,” she said.Sanctions are much-criticised financial penalties whereby claimants are docked at least four weeks’ benefit income if they break conditionality agreements, such as failing to attend a jobcentre interview or to spend enough time searching for jobs.The decision immediately came under fire from Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, who said it was “incomprehensible” that the government was threatening to reduce people’s financial support at a time when unemployment had risen sharply and job vacancies had dropped.Poverty charities also criticised the move: Iain Porter, a policy manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “The social security system must not be used to force people into searching for jobs which currently don’t exist at a time when many will still be facing restrictions.”Ayaz Manji, the senior policy officer at the mental health charity Mind, called the decision “appalling” and demanded it be reversed. “Suspending benefit sanctions was put in place to protect people from the impact of coronavirus. But reintroducing sanctions when coronavirus is still very much an issue is nonsensical,” Manji said.Abi Gill, the policy manager of the homelessness charity Centrepoint, said: “This simply isn’t a time for talking tough. The fact is that sanctions were never effective in helping people find jobs and they’re nothing short of cruel now those looking for work vastly outnumber an ever-shrinking number of vacancies”.However, the Department for Work and Pensions insisted that conditionality arrangements would be sensitive to new claimants’ local jobs market and personal circumstances, and that clear guidance would be issued to staff to ensure people were not sanctioned unless they breached conditionality “for no good reason”.A DWP spokesperson said: “Now our focus is rightly switching to getting Britain back into work. From July, people can make an appointment with their work coach if they can’t get the help they want online or over the phone and work coaches will be calling all claimants to help them get ready for the world of work.”Although the new conditionality arrangements would apply to new claimants, existing claimants would for now keep their existing job search agreements, suggesting that DWP officials will be given a large degree of discretion in judging whether sanctionable breaches of the rules have occurred.The announcement came as the main union representing DWP staff warned that many jobcentres would be expected to open on 1 July without having conducted a proper Covid-19 risk assessment, creating a risk of staff and public getting or spreading the virus.A staff survey by the PCS union revealed widespread concerns that there was insufficient space in jobcentres to implement a safe 2-metre social distancing requirement between staff and claimants, as well as a lack of plastic screens and personal protective equipment.A jobcentre official said: “This is a major change but there’s been no full health and safety risk assessment that looks at how the public and staff will be kept safe.”The DWP insisted that “staff and customer safety is our priority” and that sites were being “adapted to ensure they are Covid-19 safe”. It said it was fitting screens and social distancing signage, and providing masks and hand sanitisation facilities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93e32ad6a9c080e341b7a07f4d31221f61822718/0_38_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd0fc58f648d2312c27a85c352d26f85","title":"black trans lives matter march in london in pictures","story":"Thousands of transgender people and supporters gathered in London to raise awareness about the discrimination and prejudices faced by the black transgender community.

Less than two years after being acquitted of affray in Bristol crown court, the role would continue the upward career trajectory that included being awarded an OBE for his heroics during the World Cup and Ashes campaigns last year.“Getting the opportunity to captain England is a huge honour, even if it is only the once you can still say: ‘Yeah I’ve captained England,’” Stokes said. “It’s a huge thing to think about and, if it does present itself, then obviously I’m really looking forward to it.”“I don’t normally like to speak about myself in this way but, looking back, I’m proud of what I’ve been able to do since that incident happened. It’s been through complete dedication and hard work towards the job I do.”Stokes jokingly told the online media conference that his on-field approach will be “nine slips and a gully” and while this may have overlooked the need for wicketkeeper, it summed up the 29-year-old’s desire to stamp his mark on the short‑term role. “I’ve been a senior player since 2016 and learning from Alastair Cook and Rooty has rubbed off on me. And we’ve got some really experienced guys who I can use Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, who’ve got ample Test matches and wickets between them. I’d like to think I’ll be an open captain and won’t think my way is the only way.”Stokes last captained 12 years ago – a Durham age-group side – and said he had not viewed himself as the successor to Root in the same way the Yorkshireman was next in line to Cook (who in turn had been groomed for the top job under Andrew Strauss).England have 30 players at the Ageas Bowl, which will be whittled down to an official Test squad on Saturday after a three-day warm-up match that begins on Wednesday. Stokes does not expect to have an input here but will still want to be leading a team of his choice out into the middle.“I think a lot of what guys do in training and what guys do in this warm-up will have an influence. You can only pick 11. I might not have as many friends after this Test.”West Indies have announced they will have the Black Lives Matter logo designed by Alisha Hosannah, partner of the Watford striker Troy Deeney, on their shirt collars during the first Test and England appear likely to follow suit. There may also be a collective gesture before the match amid growing talk of the players taking the knee.Anthems are expected to be played on the first morning, while television viewers are due to have the option of background crowd noise – most likely a track of the famous Lord’s hum – despite the absence of spectators.Asked about the lack of atmosphere in the grounds this summer, Stokes replied: “I don’t think it’s a struggle to get yourself up for playing for England. I think what the crowd does is gives you an extra bit of energy.“I don’t think that we can use that as an excuse for our levels of intensity. We’re walking on to the field representing England. You’ve got the Three Lions on your chest, it is a completely different situation to what we’re used to but everybody will be fine.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb2551916e58186183b36f12d11eeb7448564425/0_222_6720_4036/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fb712ef74b4933166d7b9939776bca9","title":"liam plunkett overcoming anxiety has improved me 100 as a cricketer","story":"The fast bowler discusses his hurt at being dropped by England after winning the World Cup and how grit he gets from his mum keeps negative thoughts at bay“It was a gift for me when I got anxiety,” Liam Plunkett says calmly as if he is talking about a birthday present rather than the moment when he began to confront the stress and uncertainty which once plagued him.“If I didn’t get anxiety I probably wouldn’t have played in the World Cup. Many of us define anxiety as a really bad thing – and for lots of people it is – but when I deal with anxiety it helps me massively in other areas of life.”On Tuesday it will be a year since Plunkett was recalled to England’s World Cup side after they endured a third defeat in the group stages. England had won the four group matches when Plunkett had played and lost all three when he was excluded. He returned to face India and took three of the five opposition wickets to fall, including that of the great Virat Kohli, and helped England secure the decisive victory that led to the semi-finals and winning a final that needed a super over to decide the outcome.Plunkett is 35 and, bolstered by his intention to play first-class cricket as long as possible, he is philosophical and interested in examining how he turned his past anxiety into a constructive process. “I was fortunate my anxiety didn’t happen on the cricket pitch in front of 50,000 people. It was always when I was facing a one-to-one situation. I know it affects different people in different ways but, for me, it really became a gift.”At the time his panic attacks were distressing. “The first one happened when I was on a flight from Newcastle to Heathrow and then on to the US to see my wife. I had to get off the flight just before they closed the door. All of a sudden you’re sat in the plane and sweating. I really wanted to be with my wife but I couldn’t get over this massive hurdle of staying on that flight.”“It’s like an invisible wall. Everything is foggy and I couldn’t get through this wall. It was only that I’d handed my passport in and didn’t have the correct visa which distracted my mind. I managed to get the visa and made the flight. But when I landed at Adelaide I didn’t have the courage to get in a car, or take a taxi to training.”“I spoke to someone in Adelaide for a couple of sessions. He helped me. I tried to eat healthy and train smart. I was treating my body with respect and it helped clear my mind. But it’s frightening the first time. I know people who can go spiralling down and it can be fatal for some. But I always know there is a way out. There’re always strategies and people to talk to.”Plunkett has learned to control his anxiety. “I’m pretty good now. I know what triggers it and I don’t want to put myself out there within a few days of the trigger. I need time to recover.”“They’re incredible people. My old man had cysts that affected his organs. So he had both transplants. But they’re real strong and just cracked on with life. I’ve been a bit like Mum and Dad when I’ve hit roadblocks. I’ve always found a positive.In 2007 he offered his dad one of his kidneys as a potential donor. “He didn’t want none of it,” Plunkett says. “I was playing in the World Cup in the Caribbean and I offered it because he was struggling. But he’s in a decent place now.”Plunkett’s desire to help others is evident in his commitment to the Player Resettlement Programme he has just launched with Chris Peel of The Training Room – a company that educates people through health and fitness. The PRP offers courses in personal training, IT, education and events management to professional sports people so they can forge alternative careers in retirement.“I jumped at the chance,” Plunkett says, “because people in professional sport have such transferable skills. We want to help them think about using those skills to find new career paths. That question of ‘What next?’ can be a tough one but it can also be exciting. Cricket’s been a massive part of my life the last 16 years. While I’m still performing, and helping win games, I want to play as long as possible. But just because cricket stops one day doesn’t mean you can’t be passionate about another role – like the PRP.”Plunkett and his World Cup‑winning teammates enjoyed an all-day session on Zoom while last year’s thrilling final was screened again on television. “It was very cool. I’d recorded my bowling and watched that thousands of times but I’d not watched the full thing. People were coming in and out of the Zoom session all day and we had a couple of beers and a good chat. It was fun to relive that memory together – as a band of brothers who won the World Cup. Not many groups do that.”They needed some hard meetings during the tournament when England were on the brink of elimination. “There was a big one at Edgbaston. Everyone got to vent. I wasn’t in the team at that point and I said: ‘I’m pissed off I’m not playing, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want people to do well.’ I was dropped after performing well but there were lots of games and I accepted it. I said: ‘I’m not going to sit like a moody little kid in the corner. That’s poison for the dressing room.’ It cleared the air and helped us go in the right direction.”His teammates shared that positivity and, with some good fortune, England became world champions amid excruciating tension. “I was so proud to win with that bunch of boys. Everything was buzzing afterwards in the dressing room. I sat down to take my boots off and that wave of emotion hit me. I started to sob tears of joy.”Different emotions, pinned down by disappointment, were felt a few months later when Plunkett discovered on social media he had been dropped. “I think that’s what it is,” he says of the hurt caused by the inexplicable decision not to tell him personally.“I appreciate it’s sport, at the highest level, and new people are always coming in but do I still think I’m good enough to play for England? Of course. But that ship has sailed and I’m not a person to hold grudges. I’m trying to get on with the next thing at Surrey.”Plunkett has floated the idea of playing for USA in a World Cup, as he and his American wife may settle in the States, but he sounds philosophical. “I want to play for as long as I can for Surrey. Hopefully that’s another three years. Then it’s three years to qualify for the US.

He has seven of the 17 possible runners at his stable in County Tipperary, though none are shorter than 7-1 in the betting.O’Brien has so many talented horses in his care that he usually has several runners in the best Flat races in Britain and Ireland, the most recent example being Saturday’s Irish Derby, in which he had six of the 14 who took part and ended up with the first four home. That means he is well placed to influence the way in which a race develops and his several runners are generally eyed with mistrust by rivals with a single runner.Sheikh Fahad, whose Kameko is second-favourite for the Derby, spoke up through Twitter after the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, saying: “There’s no place for team tactics in racing, such a shame to watch the St James run like that.”Sunday’s Racing Post brought another intervention, from Bjorn Nielsen, whose English King is the Derby favourite. “A lot of people with good horses are worried,” he said. “Team tactics threaten to devalue racing at the highest class. A pacemaker is one thing but sitting there and forming a peloton is quite another.”While he also did not name O’Brien, he spoke approvingly of Ger Lyons’s comments after the Irish Guineas, in which Siskin had to be strong to establish racing room among Ballydoyle runners. “We knew through the history books what the Ballydoyle riders were going to try to do,” Lyons said, though he added: “All is fair in love and war. It’s a big boys’ sport and you just put on your big boy pants and get out there and do the job.”O’Brien was careful not to use any names in his answers, saying at one point: “I don’t ever talk about anyone else’s horses or any other people. I would be always afraid that I would offend someone and that’s why I say very little most of the time.”But he insisted rivals had nothing to fear on this score. “Every single horse, I will always give the jockey what I think is the best instructions for that horse to win that race. Some horses want to be ridden forward, some horses like to be mid-, some horses like to be dropped in.” He noted an apparent assumption on the part of his rivals that, when he fields several runners, one of them will set the pace.“What happens a lot of the time, if one of our horses is not making the running, there’s no pace and the race becomes an absolute muddle, everyone is jockeying for positions. It can become very messy.”While he did not wish to cite an example, O’Brien feels sour grapes can be a factor in some of the things said about his operation. “Sometimes what happens is a big jockey or a big trainer, high profile, they might start crying after the race, to relieve pressure off themselves, for their owners or for some mistake that they made. And it’s easy for them to point the finger at us.”O’Brien expects to have at least six Derby runners. Armory may yet be erted to France, he says, but that would still leave Vatican City, Mogul, Russian Emperor, Amhran Na Bhfiann, Mythical and Serpentine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01ad5516cfd55783090b45d23468bea7560f85c8/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9677459dfdd12d76d4f5be9636c83db4","title":"who is the greatest female tennis player of the last 50 years","story":"With no Wimbledon to entertain us, let’s reminisce about the great players we have enjoyed watching in years gone byThere will be no Wimbledon this year, but we can still have a good debate about tennis.

Dave Watts took this photograph of his daughter Minna, five, on the daily walk he and his wife, Frances, a landscape artist, have taken with their three young children. Watts and his family live on the edge of a town in Somerset, where he works as a commercial photographer, but when jobs dried up in April and the kids were home from school the days took on a less predictable, sometimes magical shape, one he has tried to capture.“There is a network of footpaths and we fell into doing the same route every day,” he says. “Probably about a mile and a half, always quite a leisurely pace. The children got into the habit of stopping in the same places to play. Because it was at the end of such a long dry spell, this place was dusty and Minna loved that she throws herself into being busy and messy.”In some ways, shrinking horizons have perhaps taken children across the country back in time a little – with not much traffic on the roads, and long days to fill.Watts started his career as a travel photographer based in London, before moving back to Somerset, near his childhood home, when his eldest child was born. The weeks of relative confinement have been a bittersweet time, he suggests – the fears and liberation of an empty schedule. The family has been sustained in part by Frances selling some work through the Artist Support Pledge. “To start with there was a lot of anxiety, with the pandemic and the lack of income, but then there were also these lovely sunny days outside with the kids,” Watts says. His pictures capture some of that contrast – the poignancy of living in the moment, and trying not to wonder what comes next."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18c101197884627a67ce52f0a67516a88393f16b/0_0_5381_3229/master/5381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62c2b8a26a836a6e724d4765aa651915","title":"are you thinking of booking a holiday abroad","story":"We want to hear from people who are considering or have booked a holiday abroad for the summer holiday or later in the yearThe current Foreign Office travel warning against all but essential international travel will be lifted from 6 July for countries deemed safe.

Having been locked down in Belfast for months, I was desperate to break out of my Covid-19 cocoon and stretch my horizons beyond the TV screen – and my legs beyond the local supermarket run.A 90-minute drive from Belfast, the Sperrin mountains, in mid-Ulster, are a place where the myth and the majesty of the country’s landscape overlap. It’s a vast, open space, one that Irish poet Mary Montague described as “Ulster’s wildest land”, adding that “the thickest sheets of the last ice age scoured these mountains into smooth undulations that banner the skyline”. “But”, she cautioned, “don’t be fooled by gentle curves – the Sperrins’ heart is vastly bleak.”Now, however, there’s a corner of comfort in this wild landscape, a place that also aims to capture the panoramic grandeur of the setting. With its upland coniferous terrain of mossy hills and winding trails, Davagh Forest, in the foothills just outside Cookstown, has recently become the first area in the country – and the third on the island of Ireland – to be accredited as an International Dark Sky Park. Within the forest, the OM Dark Sky Park and Observatory is a £1.25m facility with an interactive exhibition linking the landscape with the archaeological and astronomical heritage of the Sperrins, holographic installations, virtual reality headsets, and a state-of-the-art 14-inch aperture telescope. Scheduled to open in April, but delayed by the pandemic until autumn, it promises to be a spectacular voyage through the solar system.A mile down the road, and just opened, Sperrinview Glamping offers a range of luxury pods that are snug and reasonably priced. In a disused quarry, the four pods are clad in corrugated metal, each a different colour in keeping with the flora on the surrounding hills. From the outside they look a bit like asteroids that have plummeted into the ground: pointing up to the sky with a large triangular viewing window at the fore so that guests can gaze out at the stars from their bed.The wood-clad interiors feature two double beds and a sofa bed, a kitchenette and a shower room. Each pod has its own outdoor space defined by a circle of rocks, with fire pit and barbecue. All the pods were occupied on opening day, but they are set well enough apart to achieve the essential distancing necessary in these times. There’s hand sanitiser on each pod’s exterior, and it’s necessary to bring your own towels and bedlinen. The atmosphere remains relaxed, though. Children ran free and fire pits were lit as the night crept in.As constellations emerged above us, one group – a civilised hen or birthday party – made the most of the communal hub (a cosy space with kitchen, sofa and tables near the entrance). I opted to stargaze from the comfort of my bed, even getting a peek at what seemed to be the International Space Station passing overhead. Arriving from the increasingly busy post-lockdown streets of Belfast only served to highlight the appeal of this wilderness sanctuary. Straddling the counties of Derry and Tyrone, the Sperrins weave a mottled tapestry of mountains, bogland and inland tarns, as well as megalithic ruins and prehistoric curiosities. From the court and wedge tombs at Dun Ruadh (Red Fort) on the sweeping curve of Crockyneill, to myriad stone sites and alignments in the shadow of Slieve Gallion mountain, it’s a staggering invitation to reconnect with the land and delve deeper into its legends.A five-minute walk from the glamping pods and an essential portal into the history of the area is Beaghmore, a complex of seven low stone circles, standing stones and round cairns purportedly predating Stonehenge and even Newgrange, the ancient heart of Ireland. The best time to see them is before sundown, and I’d arranged to meet up with local historian Hugh McCloy, who leads tours through the area. Having the opportunity to delve deep into its history, a few days shy of Midsummer Day, wasn’t lost on me. As a sacred site, it genuinely felt like a gateway to beyond. Translated from the Irish Bheitheach Mhór, meaning “big place of birch trees,” Hugh told me that the area was once a woodland before being cleared by neolithic farmers that it was discovered in the late 1930s when the peat was being cut and that it is a bona fide “thin place”: a place where the veil between this world and the eternal world is slight. Hugh builds a heady narrative about those who inhabited the land thousands of years ago, as well as telling the tale of local giant, Callann Mór, believed to be buried at Carnanbane on the west side of Slieve Gallion mountain. At Ballybriest, a neolithic court tomb in the shadow of Slieve Gallion, we stopped for a picnic from local restaurant Apparo and Hugh shared his belief that “giant’s DNA still runs through the local population”.With the future of far-flung travel uncertain, the opportunity afforded us to explore the wonders on our doorstep is a gift, according to Hugh, a chance for people to “feel the wind in the hair and dream again”. The interconnectedness between ancient sites, nature and the stars above now seems like a worthy priority. And I speak as someone who actually grew up a half-hour from the Sperrins and is only now grasping just how much this world has to offer. Suddenly, Mary Montague’s description of this landscape as “vastly bleak” feels like a towering endorsement.• Pods start from £100 a night and sleep up to five, sperrinviewglamping.

He was joking, but he had a point. If Francesca hadn’t been an A\u0026ampE doctor this spring in the northern Italian city of Cremona, working 12-hour shifts at a hospital overrun with Covid-19 patients, things might have been easier for the Mangiatordi family.“We haven’t hugged each other for a month,” she said. Nor had she touched her son or daughter. That was not just sensible but remarkable, given that they live in a small flat.The news told the Mangiatordis that Italy had overtaken China as the country with the most Covid-19 deaths. Although the director, Sasha Joelle Achilli, filmed this intimate, moving, bleak diary in March and April, the pandemic has swept on so unremittingly since that it felt like a historical document.Francesca’s children veered between hero-worship for their mother and terror over what she might bring home. “I imagine mum like Captain America in Avengers: Endgame,” said 13-year-old Damiano. It’s not a perfect analogy – Covid-19’s endgame is more Beckett than Marvel.Every day, his mother did battle with something beyond Captain America’s skill set. She dealt with bed and oxygen tank shortages, decided whether a 35-year-old or an 85-year-old should get the single remaining free bed, decoded lung scans and phoned the nearest and dearest to say their loved one had just died alone. “There’s no dignity any more,” said Francesca, tired eyed and tearful, to camera at the end of her shift.“I’m scared she might bring it home not so much for me or my brother, but because of my father,” the 11-year-old daughter, Maria Teresa, confided to camera. She imagined what would happen if the virus killed her parents. “I don’t know how to cook and him neither,” she said, breaking into sobs. “Without them, we don’t know how to do anything.”Although Francesca did not contract the virus, her best friend at hospital, Dr Laura Bocchi, did. “I’m a patient and, unfortunately, I possess medical knowledge that sometimes makes my fears worse,” said Laura. She self-isolated in her son’s bedroom. She only saw her son and husband on video calls from different rooms in the same apartment. Every now and again, Laura would appear silhouetted at the frosted glass of the bedroom door, a spectral figure in a little flat pressing a hand against glass in a futile reach for human contact.Achilli’s genius was for capturing the quotidian human struggle for dignity against the odds. While 30-year-old Crystal awaited the result of tests in a hospital corridor, she rang her husband. She told him to go into another room so their three daughters could not hear. “I don’t know yet, Sebastian. Don’t say anything in front of the girls.”Everyone in this documentary was so beautiful that their tragedy reminded me of the one in Nanni Moretti’s 2001 Palme d’Or winning film, La Stanza del Figlio (The Son’s Room), in which a beautiful family’s beautiful son drowns, leaving his family decorously bereft. It seemed wrong that such tragedy should afflict anyone, but doubly wrong that it should afflict them.Add to this the fact that Achilli marginalised death and foregrounded survival, and you’ll understand my slight misgivings about the film. There was one short scene in which a corpse was taken down a dimly lit corridor to the mortuary and placed in a coffin by dignified staff. Otherwise, death was the unseen predator lurking behind these heartening stories of those who made it through.Achilli’s film nonetheless works as a moral lesson from humanity’s better selves about how we should behave with restraint and care for others in extremis rather than, say, sullying the name of Barnard Castle or wrecking Bournemouth.The hour-long documentary was threaded through with the story of 18-year-old Mattia, taken into intensive care with the virus engulfing his lungs. Hardly anyone made it out of the intensive care unit (ICU) with such symptoms, said nurse Cristina Pilati. His mother wrote in the local newspaper asking the nurses to do what she could not: hold him.Ultimately, like Crystal and Laura, Mattia fought off the virus. After 12 days in the ICU, he lay chastened in a recovery bed. “I remember that I sent my last texts. I gave my phone to the doctors.” An older patient in the next bed said: “After an experience like that, what could possibly scare you? Nothing!” Mattia looked thoughtful. Perhaps, his expression said. Perhaps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3890e5403d98ef6c78d3647b829ccf09206aceb3/0_73_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cde73ef5e28356474303f7bc8fa709ec","title":"ruperts radio can murdoch times radio compete with the bbc","story":"Hatched to rival Radio 4, the new station is closer in tone to 5 live or LBC – and a slow start means it still has much to proveTimes Radio – which launched today at 6am as a daily audio version of Rupert Murdoch’s highest-brow newspaper – had the coup of securing Boris Johnson’s first broadcast interview since his recovery from coronavirus. The conversation started with the prime minister, making space for his notes on the studio table, displacing the most crucial tool of radio broadcasting, making it sound as if he were whispering.“Sorry, we’re going to have to get your microphone closer,” said the co-host (and station launch director) Stig Abell. “You’ve moved it away.”There was a clatter as the presenter intervened. It is probably a good thing Johnson has already had Covid-19, as Abell had broken physical distancing rules.“Howzat?” boomed Johnson, sounding like one of the bowlers still banned from village greens.So, how was Times Radio? Since selling Sky TV, Murdoch has compensated by expanding his presence in UK audio broadcasting. This is his fourth wireless enterprise, after Virgin Radio, talkRadio and talkSport. The newcomer shares some on-air personnel with the other Murdoch speech networks (“That interview from our sister station, TalkSport 2”) and follows Virgin by eschewing adverts in favour of corporate sponsorship, which, in practice, means frequent commercials for the station itself and other Murdochian products.On the early evidence, Times Radio most resembled a good-quality karaoke BBC Radio 5 live. Abell’s breakfast co-host, Aasmah Mir, has Radio 4 on her BBC CV (as does the afternoon host Mariella Frostrup), but Mir learned her craft at Radio 5 live in her new role, she echoed the youngest BBC speech station’s chatty informality. Abell was also notably informal, pronouncing news as “nooze” and speaking so casually that the ends of sentences were sometimes incomprehensible. Laid-back is one thing leaning back too far from the microphone is another.Times Radio was talked-up in advance as a rival to Radio 4 – an antidote to the imperial self-importance of which detractors have accused that channel – but it seemed in competition only immediately after the 8am news, and less through its own efforts than a decision of Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser. He had not only given Johnson’s first on-air one-on-one for three months to a BBC rival, but offered him in the time slot that Radio 4’s Today prides as Britain’s premier platform for politicians.The launch felt like one of Murdoch’s more subtle moves in his long, hostile campaign against the BBC. The Cummings-Johnson administration seemed happy to cooperate, forcing Today and the BBC to credit a Murdoch outfit if they wanted to report what Johnson had said.That dilemma was reduced by the failure of the interview to produce much news of significance, partly because, despite being asked good questions on Cummings and Covid-19, Johnson ignores any topic he does not want to discuss. The only solution is to become furious, as Andrew Neil once did in a TV encounter, but that would not fit the general gentleness for which this station seems to be aiming.The prime minister oozed his usual bluff about doubling down on levelling up, whacking moles and putting his arms around workers. A fresher Johnson buzzword, “Rooseveltian”, was allowed by the presenters to pass without explanation, although, in after-chat analysis, the network’s “chief political commentator”, Tom Newton Dunn, eventually glossed the economic interventionism of the 32nd US president.The biggest and most expensive obstacle to setting up a speech station is the construction of a global news operation, but Times Radio can cannily recycle correspondents from Murdoch print titles. The excellent Newton Dunn has transferred full-time from the Sun, but Times and Sunday Times reporters were called on to animate other news stories, although the word is that they will not be paid extra for this moonlighting.In a welcome departure from Radio 4 and Radio 5 live – where, in male-female pairings, the man always seems to be top dog – Mir feels positioned as lead morning presenter, as befits experience and technique superior to Abell’s. If the network can establish an audience – and the airing of tweets from listeners in Australia and Bangladesh suggested widespread initial curiosity – then Mir could become the star that the BBC never quite allowed her to be.Her double act with Abell needs more work, though. He told the same story about his attitude to cashpoints in the first and second hours, although his co-host, either from politeness or tiredness, managed to express surprise at the reprise.Luke Jones, a talented young reporter bought in from Radio 4’s lunchtime news shows, made a bright start, reporting throughout the day from a maternity unit at a hospital in Newcastle – another very Radio 5 live type of feature. Jones suddenly lost an interviewee because she was “in the birthing pool and starting to push”, a line I have only heard previously on radio in The Archers. Trumping that, the reporter later introduced the debut day’s most startling sound-effect – a baby vomiting. Jones, who will also co-host Friday-Sunday breakfasts, feels like another loss to the BBC.Having started as a Radio 5 live tribute act, Times Radio, channelled a newer audio phenomenon in the second show on its schedule. Matt Chorley’s 10am-1pm programme is an expansion of his impressive Times podcast Red Box, which provides Westminster insight and rumour. Asked what he thought of Mir and Abell’s prime ministerial interview, Chorley tactfully, and accurately, replied that Johnson is “a hard one to pin down”.Between frontline political guests – Gus O’Donnell, Alistair Darling, George Osborne – Chorley’s opinionated soliloquies sound more LBC than Radio 5 live, suggesting that Times Radio is aiming to take listeners from a variety of rival stations. It was a wonder they didn’t put on Pachelbel’s Canon in D and go after Classic FM and Scala.While the pandemic made launching a broadcaster much harder logistically, the prevalence of video conferencing and phone interviews during lockdown has set technical expectations lower – listeners are more tolerant of blips and slips, such as the studio not being able to raise a line to Chorley’s third guest. But, in technical terms, it was generally a slick and confident launch.Judgment on content must wait longer. The new station’s parent paper was historically nicknamed the Thunderer. Some of the first day content suggested the risk of Times Radio becoming known as The Chunterer – especially when Mir and Abell swapped stories about their preferred nutritional smoothies and their children’s births. Or perhaps The Repeater: Newton-Dunn discussed the Johnson interview with Frostrup and then drivetime host John Pienaar in much the terms he had at breakfast. Pienaar, familiar with rolling news, was typically sharp and engaging, but Frostrup, new to the long magazine format, seemed to run out of material in the third hour. She filled a chunk with extracts from earlier programmes, including a replay of her own interview with actress and activist Rose McGowan that we had heard around 90 minutes before.The BBC’s squadrons of on-air correspondents and the alleged over-staffing in production have long been targets of editorials in The Times Times Radio, conversely, sometimes sounded under-staffed on and off air. If so, it was perhaps lucky to launch on a slow news day, with the reorganisation of the civil service the biggest tale in town. The big test will come when, in a year of events that have felt like an adaptation of the Book of Revelations, the next apocalypse invades its airwaves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bae33653f798a178342a7884231f46306291b74/0_115_5253_3152/master/5253.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b45549bf057cb0a5f097edd9ba8fd71","title":"san quentin coronavirus cases covid 19","story":"The number of coronavirus cases in California’s San Quentin state prison has crossed a thousand, with more than 900 cases being diagnosed in the last two weeks alone.San Quentin is the latest California department of corrections and rehabilitation (CDCR) facility to deal with a large coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic this spring. But the crisis in the historic state prison stands apart because of the rapid spread of infections.San Quentin is California’s oldest correctional facility, and has the state’s only death row for males. Organizers and attorneys say the outbreak in the facility can be traced back to the transfer of almost 200 people the CDCR considered highly vulnerable to Covid-19 from the California Institution for Men (CIM) in Chino to San Quentin and Corcoran state prisons. At the time, CIM had over 450 Covid-19 cases while San Quentin had zero reported infections and Corcoran had one.Within three weeks of the transfer, San Quentin had 499 infected iniduals and Corcoran had 148.Meanwhile, advocates worry that prison transfers from San Quentin to other facilities have sparked new infections. In Lassen county, almost 300 miles from the San Francisco Bay Area, positive cases at the California correctional center have shot from zero to 210 within a week following a June transfer from San Quentin.Since the start of the pandemic, organizers, attorneys and public health experts have called on authorities to release prisoners who are vulnerable to succumbing to the impacts of Covid-19 and to stop transferring people from one prison to another to curb the spread of the virus.They are also urging the CDCR to improve testing at the facilities and to limit the movements between different sections of the facilities.Nationally, coronavirus outbreaks in the prisons and jails have been described as preventable disasters by advocates, attorneys and public health officials. Many argue that ageing infrastructure and cramped quarters make prisons and jails a place where social distancing is impossible. In California, where prison overcrowding is the topic of the more than decade-long Plata lawsuit, organizers say that the only surefire way to avoid widespread infection and death among staff and inmates is to approve mass releases.Since early-March, as California’s first coronavirus-induced stay-at-home orders were enacted, California has released almost 8,000 people from their institutions.On 16 June CDCR announced their community supervision program that will allow people to spend the last 180 days or less of their prison sentence in home confinement under post-release supervision. The program is set to launch on 1 July and excludes people serving time for violent and serious offenses, domestic violence, and those who would have to register as sex offenders upon release.The news comes as California faces a surge of coronavirus cases across the state, prompting the governor, Gavin Newsom, to call on counties to roll back plans for reopening. Over the weekend Newsom ordered closed bars and nightclubs in nine counties, including Los Angeles, which has nearly 100,000 cases – the most of any region of the state.Newsom addressed the San Quentin outbreak at a press conference on Monday, saying he was formalizing plans to transfer patients to Seton hospital, an outside medical facility, if needed.Already the state has released roughly 3,500 prisoners early, prioritizing release for medically vulnerable inmates, those with little time remaining on sentences and prisoners convicted of non-violent crimes. Newsom said today another 3,500 have been identified as potentially eligible for early release.A key challenge facing both state officials and inmates is securing housing for those in consideration for early release, and not making “a bad situation worse by releasing someone who’s not ready to be released”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34b3e8911236dd30fbac329e30dd179537b15a45/0_243_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=244532177054f7cc92cd130be6f21ea6","title":"all children in england back at school in september","story":"All pupils expected to return on full timetable, with year groups separated in secondaries, guidance saysAll children in England will be expected to go back to school in September on a full timetable, with secondary pupils kept in “Covid-secure” year groups to limit transmission of the virus, according to leaked guidance.The government is said to be keen to avoid a “vague and woolly” start to the new academic year after months of uncertainty since schools closed to the majority of pupils in March, as part of a national effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus.Official guidance due to be published on Thursday is expected to advise secondary headteachers in England to keep entire year groups separate throughout the school day, with staggered start and end times, as well as lunch and break times.Specialist teachers will however be able to move between year groups, to ensure that pupils are taught the full curriculum where possible. Plans for primary school children, who are currently taught in “protective bubbles” of 15, will allow for them to be taught by a single teacher in groups of 30, which is the usual class size.Until recently the need for social distancing has been a key stumbling block to government ambitions to get all children back in school in England, but the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, indicated on Monday that a full return to school in the autumn was not dependent on social distancing.“It’s not about 1 metre, it’s not about 2 metres,” he told BBC Breakfast, saying that safety would be based on “reducing the number of transmission points” within schools. He also confirmed that from September parents would be fined if their children did not attend schools without a good reason.According to detailed plans reported by Huffpost UK, the government is keen to see a return to the full curriculum where possible, but secondary schools are expected to be told to focus on the core subjects, with some year 11 pupils allowed to drop other GSCEs to allow them to concentrate on English and maths.The NHS test-and-trace system is seen as a critical element in ensuring a safe return for all pupils, with plans for classes or entire year groups to be sent home if a pupil tests positive. All schools will be expected to draw up contingency plans in the event of a partial closure or local lockdown, with renewed pressure on teachers to provide high-quality remote teaching if children cannot be at school.Significant challenges remain, particularly around transport to and from school where it will be more difficult for schools to manage behaviour. It is understood pupils will be advised to walk or cycle where possible, while those on public transport aged 11 and above will be expected to wear face masks.Richard Sheriff, chief executive of the Red Kite Alliance, which includes nine primary schools and four secondary schools across Leeds and North Yorkshire, said: “I’m fully expecting all children to be back in school on a full timetable from September. The government is going to be very, very keen to make sure this is not a vague and woolly start. This is going back to a fully functioning, rich, deep curriculum as quickly as possible.”Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies, which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, added: “While class-based bubbles work for primary schools, the complexity of setting and options choices means secondary school bubbles should be on a year-group basis.“A bubble would occupy a set of ‘home base’ classrooms in close proximity to each other to restrict pupils’ movement. Pupils would receive as much subject teaching as possible within these. They could move between rooms in their bubble to facilitate setting arrangements but would not move beyond their assigned area unless there was a specific need to utilise another space. Where spaces occupied by one bubble need to be used by another bubble, thorough disinfection would be required before and after.”Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the leaked plans were “quite some way from being satisfactory for schools”. The Department for Education has been contacted for comment.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Pupils have been returning to school since 1 June – we’ve already given primary schools the flexibility to invite more children back if they have the capacity, and 1.5 million children were in school at the end of last week.“We’ve said we want to see all children back at school in September – returning to full primary and secondary class sizes in a safe way. We continue to engage with school leaders, teaching unions and the wider sector about our plans and will publish full details later this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c49f9e8658c5786acc5eb31f14a3b31551cf6b4/0_396_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b153d842ec3886e51499ca5d7afc8f97","title":"china sterilising ethnic minority women in xinjiang report says","story":"Uighurs are among those facing involuntary contraception or threats over birth quotasChinese authorities are carrying out forced sterilisations of women in an apparent campaign to curb the growth of ethnic minority populations in the western Xinjiang region, according to research published on Monday.The report, based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women, has prompted an international group of lawmakers to call for a United Nations investigation into China’s policies in the region.The move is likely to enrage Beijing, which has denied trampling on the rights of ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and which on Monday called the allegations “baseless”.The country is accused of locking more than one million Uighurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in re-education camps. Beijing describes the facilities as job training centres aimed at steering people away from terrorism following a spate of violence blamed on separatists.Zenz’s data-driven work on the camps – which uses public documents found by scouring China’s internet – has previously been cited by experts on a UN panel investigating the facilities.Women who had fewer than the legally permitted limit of two children were involuntarily fitted with intrauterine contraceptives, says the report.It also reports that some of the women said they were being coerced into receiving sterilisation surgeries.Former camp detainees said they were given injections that stopped their periods or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth-control drugs.Government documents studied by Zenz also showed that women in some rural minority communities in the region received frequent mandatory gynaecological exams and bi-monthly pregnancy tests from local health officials.Zenz found that population growth in Xinjiang counties predominantly home to ethnic minorities fell below the average growth in primarily Han majority counties between 2017 and 2018, a year after the officially recorded rate of sterilisations in the region sharply overtook the national rate in 2016.Uighur activists say China is using the internment camps to conduct a massive brainwashing campaign aimed at eradicating their distinct culture and Islamic identity.“These findings raise serious concerns as to whether Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang represent, in fundamental respects, what might be characterised as a demographic campaign of genocide” under UN definitions, Zenz said in the report.The Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), a group of North American, European and Australian members of parliament from a range of political parties, said in a statement on Monday that it would push for a legal investigation on “whether or not crimes against humanity or genocide have taken place” in Xinjiang.IPAC was formed in June with a stated mission of standing up against “challenges posed by the present conduct and future ambitions of the People’s Republic of China”.China’s foreign ministry said the allegations were “baseless” and showed “ulterior motives”.Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian attacked media outlets for “cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues,” saying at a regular press briefing that Xinjiang is “harmonious and stable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1098124256e8804dd85947d999a3b8b9c36ec2c/0_189_4280_2570/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=256f02671f8895609ebaa09b7635a505","title":"demand ppe soars again amid shortage us cases rise","story":"Fragile supply chains and wary hospitals continue to push some workers to wear N95 masks and and gowns for up to a weekDemand and prices for personal protective equipment is soaring again across the US as coronavirus cases continue to rise in more than half of states.One of the nation’s largest organizations donating personal protective equipment (PPE) said they have received a surge in requests from Covid-19 hotspots, especially in Texas, which has paused it’s reopening plan following record increases in cases and hospitalizations.Dr Megan Ranney, an emergency room doctor and researcher at Brown University in Rhode Island who co-founded the volunteer-run organization #GetUsPPE said as cases in Texas surged, requests for PPE from health facilities in the state shot up last week from less than 2,000 pieces of equipment requested to more than 220,000, though she says that may be partly due to increased awareness of the organization.“Overall the need for N95 masks, and to a lesser degree surgical masks, are still the top requests and they consistently have been,” Ranney said.Cases have also been surging in Florida, where Dequasia Canales, a vice president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) in Miami-Dade county has been delivering caravans of PPE to nursing homes.“There is a general and persistent shortage of PPE across the state of Florida,” said Canales. She said for-profit hospitals in particular, “have some supplies, but they are being too conservative and crass with the way they are distributing and using their PPE”.As the urgency of high-profile Covid-19 outbreaks in the north-east of the country and cities such as New York faded in late spring, so did attention to the acute PPE shortage for frontline health workers. But fragile supply chains and wary hospital administrators continue to push some workers to wear N95 masks and and gowns for up to a week, even though they are designed to be changed between patients.Frontline health workers have long warned that re-using such equipment leaves them at higher risk of becoming infected.“There is no question – there is PPE entering in the country or being manufactured at this point – but who it’s allocated to and how it’s allocated equitably is still an open question,” said said Andrew Stroup, co-founder of Project N95, which collects small orders for PPE and brings them together into bulk orders manufacturers will accept.All this happens as Covid-19 cases climb in June to record levels, with some estimates putting the single-highest ever caseload this month.Cases are particularly surging in Texas, Florida and Arizona, which pushed to reopen their economies early and had looser restrictions during the Memorial Day holiday weekend in late May, which many Americans consider the unofficial start of summer.Jude Derisme, another SEIU vice president, in Palm Beach county, said some hospitals stopped forcing workers to wear N95 masks for days at a time when, “when the Covid numbers went down”. But with cases rising, “The majority of the hospitals I see here in Palm Beach county are reverting back to that practice because of the surge of Covid-19 cases,” either because they lack supplies or worry supply chains will again break down.“There’s no excuse for this – none, none,” she said.Kennel said a trailer she had obtained to store bulk orders of PPE was broken into and equipment stolen. She called masks “the new gold”. Other healthcare providers have reported receiving delivery of fake PPE and having their orders go unfulfilled.Experts described supply chain “mismatch,” where small hospitals and healthcare providers could not access PPE, because suppliers demand minimum orders for tens of millions of masks, and normal distributors have no supply.“It’s a very, very, very challenging market, and you have to be very careful,” said Brent Skoda, whose company Urgent Response Network has handled massive purchasing orders for states. “You have to deal with vetted, legitimate US companies that have insurance.”The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), which is in charge of distributing medical supplies such as masks, appeared to struggle to distribute supplies in the spring. In June, the agency said it distributed millions of surgical masks, gloves and gowns nationally, but some nursing homes which received them said the products were defective and unusable. As of June, one in five nursing homes in Florida told the federal government they still have almost no masks or gowns, according to the Miami Herald.“It’s completely unacceptable that nearly four months into this pandemic, healthcare workers in hospitals, nursing homes and in the home care profession are still being put at risk due to a lack of personal protective equipment,” said President of SEIU International, Mary Kay Henry.Further, as more health facilities try to reopen under the relaxation of stay-at-home orders, demand rises.“Demand outweighs supply by very significant factors,” said Skoda. “You’ve got China that has the world’s largest manufacturing base, they have the machines and everything else. They are not able to generate enough PPE for China, so they are definitely not capable of servicing the rest of the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ef08f2c032d5d9504b64c8efde5bae8c06289c/126_0_2795_1677/master/2795.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97f42eeeb9bb8bc0fd637302cfd4506f","title":"have differing approaches to social distancing rules caused issues in your family","story":"We want to hear from people who have experienced issues with family or friends over different approaches to physical distancingThe prime minister has confirmed that the 2-metre rule would be dropped in favour of a “1-metre-plus” approach, as people from two different households will be able to drink or dine together from 4 July in England.However, those who are more at risk or vulnerable may choose to continue to maintain the 2-metre rule or wear face masks or gloves.We want to hear from people who have experienced any issues with friends or family over different approaches to physical distancing.We are keen to hear from more than one person in the same familycouplefriendship group, if they have differing views.

It comes after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the confrontation with Chinese troops along their disputed Himalayan border.India has accused China of infringing on national sovereignty by moving thousands of troops and artillery, as well as building infrastructure, into disputed territory in Ladakh. The clash two weeks ago was the worst conflict between India and China in 60 years, and despite pledges on both sides to de-escalate, recent satellite footage appears to show China solidifying their presence along the poorly defined border.The decision to ban TikTok, an app where people upload short videos, is likely to cause reverberations through India, where it has more than 200 million users and is the most downloaded app in the country. It has become a central part of popular culture in India, with some TikTok celebrities boasting tens of million of followers.The Indian government said the decision to ban the apps was in order to protect the data and privacy of its 1.3 billion citizens and put a stop to technology that was “stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users’ data in an unauthorised manner to servers outside India”.Since the buildup of Chinese troops and violent clash at the border, there have been growing calls for a boycott of Chinese goods and investment.The government has already announced plans to impose higher trade barriers and raise import duties on about 300 products from China, as well as ban Chinese companies from bidding on telecom projects in India. The Delhi Hotel and Restaurant Owners’ Association, which represents more than 3,000 establishments in the capital, has also recently banned all Chinese nationals from their hotels and restaurants."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4c7685eaf5691dfa9d661b2b743e3c661760651/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a7517f5241e9f8dbb0582ef7d4e8492c","title":"not fit for a human coronavirus in coxs bazar refugee camps","story":"Faced with unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, families say they fear the coronavirus will bring disasterSocial distancing simply isn’t possible for the 1 million Rohingya refugees who live in Cox’s Bazar refugee camp, in southeastern Bangladesh. Families live in close quarters inside flimsy bamboo shacks, using communal toilets and water facilities. Sometimes the most basic items, such as soap, are lacking.Most of the Rohingya refugees living in the camp fled there in 2017, following a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military, which the UN has since said was carried out with “genocidal intent”. On top of psychological trauma, many have underlying health conditions that leave them especially vulnerable to Covid-19.The UN, and other agencies, have raced to open new facilities in Cox’s Bazar, but equipment is still extremely limited, and it is feared medical centres could be quickly overwhelmed. As of 28 June, 49 cases and five deaths have been recorded.Here we take a look at the conditions in two of the camps and the experiences of the people living there.There are 34 refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. This satellite view shows a handful of them.Camp 2E has more than 25,000 residents. That means there is approximately one tennis court-sized area for every 13 people.Families live in huts made from tarpaulin and bamboo. In some cases, up to 10 family members share just one room.There are about 1 million Rohingya people living in similar conditions in these adjacent camps and across the rest of the settlement.Abu Kalam lives with 11 other family members in a home built from bamboo and tarpaulin with mud walls. It’s extremely cramped, he says, but everyone is staying at home.Outside, life in the camp has ground to a halt. The children are no longer able to go to school his two older sons, who used to work on a tea stall and pulling a rickshaw, have lost their income.It’s the start of monsoon season, and some nearby homes have already been flooded, adding to the misery of lockdown. Fortunately Kalam, who lives on a hill, has not been affected.His home is ided into four small rooms, but disease spreads easily. Two weeks ago, his wife began to suffer from fever and flu-like symptoms. Now, his three-year-old son and his three daughters are sick. “I’m worried but I don’t tell them,” says Kalam. “I’m the head of the family and I don’t want to frighten them.”He reassured them that it is just the usual flu – it is flu season in the camps – and told them not to worry about Covid-19.Going to the clinic, he adds, isn’t an option. He fears that doctors would assume they had coronavirus and immediately quarantine the family. He doesn’t know where they’d be sent.Sometimes, messages about how to stay safe from the virus are relayed on loudspeakers outside, but for updates on the pandemic, he relies on people who are able to pick up an internet connection on the outskirts of the camp. Reading news updates or online advice about staying safe isn’t possible, due to an internet blackout across the camps, which the Bangladesh government says is necessary for security concerns.The family have enough soap for handwashing, but he worries about the conditions in communal facilities. The toilets, he says, are hard to maintain when they are used by so many people. They have some masks, but not enough for everyone. “It is not fit for a human to live here, it is not hygienic,” he says.It is not clear if there are confirmed coronavirus infections in camp 2E, but Kalam fears that if testing is increased then hidden cases will emerge. “It is extremely difficult to live in this crowded place in this situation,” he adds. “But we have nowhere to go.”Access to bathing is limited, with 151 more than 25,000 peopleMore than 11 times as densely populated the UK’s most crowded cityAccess to water and adequate sanitation is limited across the camps, which increases the risk of Covid-19 transmission.In Camp 17 the 16,343 residents rely on communal tube wells as their main source of water. Water is raised using a hand pump.On average, a tube well is shared between 43 people in this camp, according to data from 2019.Aid agencies say that emergency handwashing stations have been installed across the camps over recent months, but access to water remains a major concern. It is not clear if any of the new water points have been installed in camp 17.For some families, getting water from the tube wells to their shelters involves having to stand in a lengthy queue several times a day.With an average of around one shower cubicle for every 21 people, bathing areas are also extremely limited. Women, many of whom fled sexual violence in Myanmar, often do not feel safe using the cubicles, due to a lack of privacy.Every morning at 6.30am Mohamed Meah’s children queue for up to half an hour at a nearby tube well. After filling their containers, they trudge for 15 minutes back up the hill to their home. They make the same journey at noon, and sometimes in the evening, heaving water back to their bamboo and tarpaulin shelter.There used to be a water point just minutes away, says Meah, but it has been broken for almost a year. Nowadays, the family of 13 relies on the tube well that has to serve a far greater number of families. His children, who don’t have masks, wait alongside others for their turn. There’s little social distancing.Even before the outbreak, access to water was one of the biggest problems facing his family, says Meah. Now, the need for clean water, so that families can wash their hands and reduce the risk of virus transmission, is even more urgent.He adds that thankfully there are no known coronavirus cases in camp 17, but everyone is on high alert and lockdown means the already dire conditions have become even harder.“I have 13 family members, so it is very tough,” he says. They rely on rations, and barely have enough to eat. Many people in the camps have lost work due to the lockdown, and services provided by NGOs have been cut to reduce the risk of aid workers bringing the virus in with them. Meah is still able to work in a madrasa school, but no one else in the family is earning. They can’t afford to buy extra vegetables or snacks for the children.“Whenever we see people, we have a talk about Covid-19 and about the situation in the camp. We try to get more information from each other,” he says. An internet ban means there is no way to access reliable news, and instead people rely on word of mouth.Meah says that if he developed symptoms he would go to the clinic, about half-an-hour’s walk away, and follow whatever treatment is given. He isn’t sure what to expect, though. Many people are reluctant to go, he adds. Some have had bad experiences in the past, or worry about being sent into isolation.Social distancing at home, he says, wouldn’t be possible. “We all sleep together. There’s no space.”Of the 376 working tube wells in this camp, 131 of them are near a latrineOf the 376 working tube wells in this camp, 131 of them are near a latrineThe Rohingya people are playing a huge role in managing the coronavirus outbreak in Cox’s Bazar. Before the first Covid-19 case was recorded in the camps, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) was already training the existing network of 1,440 volunteer community health workers to spot symptoms and protect against the virus.The health workers, who volunteer across all the camps, are now going door to door to share information about Covid-19. Short videos are being posted on social media and posters, in Rohingya, Bengali and Burmese, are displayed around the camps, and messages are being broadcast on the radio and via speaker phones.NGOs, youth groups and women’s groups in the camps are also helping to raise awareness among their communities.With the rising number of Covid-19 cases among the Rohingya, the UNHCR now wants to train an additional 600 volunteers to work on its home-based care programme. To avoid isolation centres in the camps becoming overwhelmed, people displaying mild symptoms will be encouraged to isolate at home. Volunteers will be responsible for delivering food and water, and checking on anyone in isolation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291581.1593447422!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin pubs reopen if i was this busy normally on a monday i d be delighted","story":"The first day of phase three of the country’s reopening from lockdown saw pubs, churchs and hairdressers reopen their doors.

Photograph: Tom HonanIt is 9.50am on Monday morning, the first day of Phase Three of the country’s reopening from lockdown, and publican Hugh Hourican looks a little nervous.He is about to open the doors of the Boar’s Head early house on Capel Street to the public for the first time in 15 weeks.Hourican is not worried that nobody will show up. Just the opposite he is worried about crowds of pint-starved Dubliners crowding in and scaring off his regular early house crowd of shift-workers and, in the past at least, tourists.For this reason he decided to not to advertise the pub’s reopening and to start business on Monday at 10am rather than the usual 7am.“People haven’t been in a pub for 15 weeks. They forget how to behave. You’d be worried about the social distancing and some people were probably drinking maybe a little too much at home.”Central to Hourican’s thinking is not ruining it for others. “We want to show we are responsible businesspeople and publicans. It’s up to us to set it up for the other publicans that want to open at July 20th.”The Boar’s Head is one of about 450 pubs reopening this week in Dublin, roughly 60 per cent of the total. Only pubs serving hot meals, costing a minimum of €9, can reopen and customers can stay for a maximum of 105 minutes. Social distancing must be maintained meaning no seats at the bar and, in some cases, the erection of plastic screens between tables.On July 20th pubs can reopen without serving a hot meal, assuming the Covid-19 infections numbers remain on the right track.Hourican did not feel the need to put up screens and no one is wearing a mask but the rest of the regulations will be followed “to the letter”, he says.The clock strikes 10am and then 10.10am. No rowdy groups of lads pile through the door, only two other pub owners dropping in to wish the staff good luck.The slow start is not a concern for Hourican. He takes out a black ledger containing the bookings for the rest of the week. Today, all the time slots are fully booked from 12am to closing time. Most of the coming weekend is similar. “If I was this busy normally on a Monday, I’d be delighted.”Further up Capel Street, Slattery’s early house has been open since 7am. “On a normal day we’d get a lot of night workers and on Monday you get lots from the hospitals. Also Penneys’ workers in from doing the stock overnight and tourists arriving on the red eye,” says owner Brian Conlon.Sixty per cent of Slattery’s business comes from tourists, he says. “We won’t have them but we’ll be looking forward to getting the locals back and the shoppers. Hopefully people haven’t gotten too used to shopping from their couch.”The frontline workers usually come in from about 8.30am and Conlon says he already has a few booked in. For now its mostly pub industry types and journalists reporting on the reopening – coffee is the main drink of choice.Does he know of any other time pubs had to close for such an extended period? “I went looking in the archives and could find nothing similar to this, even during 1916 or the Spanish Flu. There were complaints about not being able to get supplies from Guinness during the Rising but no mentions of closures.”At the bar, newly hired staff member Becky Roche looks slightly flustered. Every time she pulls a pint a bank of camera flashes go off with photographers instructing her like they might a fashion model: “Towards me” ... “tilt it forward”…“turn it so we can see the logo, lovely”.“I’d never even heard of an early house before this,” Roche confesses.A garda saunters in: “Everything alright here lads?” He and the barman have a quiet conversation before the garda leaves, apparently satisfied.The Galway Hooker Bar at Heuston Station is an early house catering to train travellers, night workers, and, according to manager Paul McKevitt “auld lads waiting for their regular pubs to open”.Unlike Slattery’s or the Boar’s Head it has screens up between tables. In the corner, between two of them is Barry Richardson who has just finished work and is enjoying a pint of lager.“It’s the social aspect for me,” he says when asked what drew him back to the pub this morning. Can he see the pub scene going back to normal anytime soon? “No, not with all these,” he says nodding towards the plastic iders. “It will change the whole industry.”The publicans seem more upbeat at least. “This is different to the last recession. The publicans are a lot more upbeat and people still have money,” says Hourican. “If we can reduce or get rid of the social distancing by November I think we’ll have a bumper Christmas.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We may be at the beginning of a new era with changes starting to happenFriends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revolt"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climate"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: iStockIf home working is adopted “in whole or in part as a permanent lifestyle”, the benefits in wellbeing improved air quality and reduced carbon footprint could transform Ireland, according to an independent think-tank. The Irish Academy of Engineering (IAE) says a greener future is possible “if the country is willing to learn the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic”. In its latest analysis the body suggests the past few months have provided new perspectives and experiences, “which will help guide the country to successfully overcome the other major challenge of our time, climate change”.IAE president Dr Jim Browne, said: “One of the key lessons... is that during the crisis the public demonstrated an enormous capacity for positive behavioural change. It also showed people’s willingness to support evidence-based direction and leadership in response to a major challenge.” The same spirit of social solidarity “can and should be harnessed by the new Government to address the much greater challenge of climate change”, he added.In supporting the case for facilitating home work on a long-term basis, the IAE cites CSO figures indicating the toll commuting has taken on the country in the past.“The average commuter in Ireland is spending the equivalent of 9 full days and nights a year (approximately 220 hours) travelling back and forward to their workplace. “Some 200,000 commuters spend the equivalent of 22 full days and nights a year commuting – a collective total of 4.4 million days of travel for that cohort alone,” it notes. Apart from the human productivity cost of “this massive downtime”, the cost in fuels and environmental impact of emissions must also be considered, Dr Browne added.In contrast,the IAE highlights that during the height of the lockdown, traffic pollution in Irish cities fell by 50 per cent. “Resulting improvements in air quality, and the benefits of not having to commute, will lead to more people working-from-home, at least on a part-time basis,” the IAE suggests. The academy recommends public policy “should be fully aligned with any trend away from exclusive reliance on the static office working environment and provide whatever supports are needed to encourage and reinforce the emergent ‘no commute’ culture”. This will have implications across land use planning balanced regional development, home design, public transport, personal taxation, and access to broadband, it adds.The most practical way to build consensus, avoid undesirable social and economic outcomes and achieve the goal of a sustainable, decarbonised economy is by re-tasking the Citizen’s Assembly, it suggests – and is “the most equitable way of transitioning to a decarbonised, sustainable economy with key milestones in 2030, 2040 and 2050”.“One of the main lessons from the ongoing Covid-19 experience is that people were prepared to take coordinated, shared action to overcome a major challenge. They are also willing to embrace new ways of living. Governments north and south must now pivot this same mindset into encouraging a society-wide consensus about how best to confront climate change, as well as the challenge of developing a sustainable economy,” Dr Browne said. The IAE is an independent, not-for-profit think tank whose membership comprises many of the most experienced and distinguished engineers and technologists in Ireland. Its fellows provide of their time on a pro bono basis with the goal of advancing social and economic wellbeing of the island of Ireland.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Think-tank says greener future possible if the country is willing to learn the lessons pandemicJourney brought Tipperary native from Silicon Valley to lead diocese which includes Co CavanDo it for Dan campaign had raised over \u0026euro3 million for lifesaving treatment in the USMinister for Justice Helen McEntee reiterates commitment to review of security lawsLack of northern appointment to Seanad \u0026lsquovery unfortunate\u0026rsquo, Michelle O\u0026rsquoNeill saysHistorical documents burnt in Four Courts attack have been digitally restoredAbout 40 attend Dublin\u0026rsquos Pro Cathedral but \u0026lsquoexperience will be different for months to come\u0026rsquoPubs are shut and the streets, ripped up by contractors, are devoid of human trafficMinister for Transport Eamon Ryan says \u0026lsquowe can\u0026rsquot seal off the country\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos a story of survival here that people in the summer don\u0026rsquot see.To live like this you need resilience and stamina \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the key\u0026rsquoNo new Covid-19 related deaths but \u0026lsquoworrying\u0026rsquo new trends as 24 new cases reportedFuneral of gifted and popular teenager to take place on WednesdayNot enough to be \u0026lsquonot racist, we must be anti-racist,\u0026rsquo says councillor, who speaks of her heritageMajority of childcare facilities open doors but industry warns about viabilityVictim says she lived in constant fear of cousin who started abusing her when she was sevenRegulation is being drawn up by both the Department of Health and TransportResearch initiated by RCSI and Beaumont Hospital to assess impact of treatment on critically illAssistant Commissioner says \u0026lsquosatisfied\u0026rsquo the force gathered \u0026lsquosufficient evidence\u0026rsquo to ensure other chargesCouncil recommended dentist be censured, with conditions on his registration until those were fulfilledStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291423.1593428080!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s like christmas dublin hairdresser reopens at midnight","story":"Salon Rouge hairdressers in Inchicore, Dublin reopened seconds after midnight on Monday morning and is running continuously for 24 hours to help handle the backlog for local customers seeking hairdressing and beauty treatments.

There was a countdown from 10 to one and the bright lights of Salon Rouge were thrown on and seconds later the very first customer walked in to be greeted like everything was normal.“Good morning Mary,” said Tish Curry, the owner. “It’s great to see you again.”“It’s great to be back,” responded Mary Sexton with a smile and a confused look in the direction of The .“We decided to come back at midnight to give the re-opening a bit of buzz, a bit of excitement and not just make it all about Covid,” Curry explained when asked about the late nightearly morning opening on a day when Ireland entered phase three of the lockdown exit and took a big step towards normal.It wasn’t really all that normal though and there were reminders of Covid everywhere. “We are trying to keep it as simple as possible because staff and clients will get confused if we don’t,” Curry said.‘It’ll be a bit like Christmas’In front of her on the reception desk was a thermal temperature scanner, a box of face masks - €2 each - and a large bottle of hand sanitiser.Jen Moss was one of the stylists almost ready to go. “I’m so excited to be here,” she said. “Mind you I am just passing through and am off to my bed now but I’ll be back at 6am and I’ll work till five. It’ll be a bit like Christmas...without the presents.”She cast her eye over the appointment book and noted that they had clients throughout the night and early morning.“There’s Mary who’s getting a colour and cut and Patrick is booked in for his eyebrows. He actually did his work experience here years ago,” she said.Both Mary and Patrick are locals and loyal, Curry added. “We’ve a lot of the older clients too who would come in every week to get their hair done and for them it is a really social thing and the lockdown has been really hard. They have missed the place terribly and I’m really looking forward to them coming back,” she said.As Sexton approached the desk she was given a face mask and spritzed her hands before being led to her station with her “bits” put in a bag rather than a cloakroom.Why was she there at such a time, we wondered.“I think Tish saw me walking past a few days ago and had one look at my hair and took pity on me so squeezed me in,” she said. “I’ll probably be the first person to get my hair done in the country in months... legally at least.”She said she had been coming to Salon Rouge since it opened more than 15 years ago and admitted to cutting her fringe herself in recent weeks. “That was definitely a mistake,” she sighed.LoyalCurry peered at Sexton’s roots before the Holly the stylist set to work. “Apart from the fringe she hasn’t touched it,” she noted approvingly. “She has stayed loyal.”Patrick Brennan was equally loyal. He bounded through the door minutes later and announced that he was getting his eyebrows waxed and tinted. “I have missed them all,” he said sweeping his arm in an arc towards the staff. “I’ve been coming here for a long time I come especially when I have a competition.”“Yes, I do baton twirling and freestyling and before an event I come for my eyebrows and the spray tan. I’m not nervous coming here tonight. They always look after me, I know that.”As he talked, Sexton her head now smeared with colour which would soon be copper nodded. “They are part of our community and have been for a long time. To be honest I’ve been very nervous about Covid-19 and I’d be scared to visit a lot of places but not here. I know them well and there is great comfort in that familiarity.”As she went back to her roots, Curry fiddled with something unfamiliar, a plastic face visor. “We had to go through about 10 models before we could find one that worked for us,” she said. “So many of them kept fogging up.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Politics is a brutal business sometimes. Even when you’re on the winning side. Dara Calleary was expected by almost everyone – including himself, his supporters in Mayo and his friends in the parliamentary party – to be appointed to a senior post in Cabinet. That assumption, it turned out on Saturday afternoon, was incorrect.There was no warning of the let-down in advance. Calleary found out when he went in for his meeting with Micheál Martin in the hours after he became Taoiseach. It was, by all accounts, a difficult encounter, and Calleary left the building devastated. The news ran around the political class like wildfire.The humiliations of politics are painfully public, and after the initial shock Calleary has borne his with some fortitude and dignity. He acknowledged the hurt, but then resolved to move on. Don’t show your face in Mayo, one local party chief warned the Fianna Fáil leader.The ill-feeling in the west is real, if overdone. Pleading that your parishtowncountyregion is ignored by the government is so familiar a refrain in Irish politics it has become banal.The anger in the parliamentary party is real too, although much of it is jealousy at the elevation of blow-in Stephen Donnelly and new TD Norma Foley rather than camaraderie with Calleary. Few TDs would rather the deputy leader in the Cabinet than themselves. At a basic level politicians are all sole traders. The idea they are ready to march on the Taoiseach’s office to get a job for someone else is not one rooted in reality. Like all of these rows it will pass quickly enough. Lost their jobsMoreover, there are many people in and around politics who have lost their jobs in recent days – the Fine Gael Cabinet members (two of them from the westnorthwest region, remember), their advisers and drivers, staffers of all ranks – they have not just lost out on a promotion, they have become unemployed.It is also wise to keep in mind that for most of the public jobs for politicians is a topic in which they are profoundly disinterested. When the Junior Ministers are announced on Wednesday – a major event in political circles and a chance for Martin to calm the unrest – they will be just as uninterested.And yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this was an avoidable stumble for Fianna Fáil. Cabinets nearly always try to observe some geographical spread. They do that for a reason. Martin decided it wasn’t important enough. Early days, and he is piling up the enemies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291888.1593455492!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party s hazel chu elected lord mayor of dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHazel Chu (centre) becomes Lord Mayor of Dublin. Photograph: Michael PidgeonGreen Party councillor Hazel Chu was elected Lord Mayor of Dublin, at a vote of Dublin City Council in the Mansion House on Monday evening.Ms Chu was elected with 43 votes, to Fine Gael councillor Anne Feeney’s nine votes.Ms Chu is the cathaoirleach of the Green Party and spokeswoman for enterprise. She was elected to the council as a first time candidate in the 2019 local elections, topping the poll in the Pembroke ward with over 4,000 first preferences. Born in Ireland to parents from Hong Kong, she is the first elected councillor of Chinese heritage in the Republic. She becomes the first Lord Mayor of Dublin from the Green Party since John Gormley held the title in 1994 – and would later go on to lead the party. In a speech after her election, Ms Chu said she would use the position to have “an open and frank conversation on the topic of racism and gender inequality.”“In recent years, we have seen the polarisation of politics in countries overseas, Ireland is not immune to this,” and had seen evidence of far-right groups in recent years, she said. The Black Lives Matter movement had taught her there is no such thing as an “innocent bystander,” and it was not enough to be “not racist, but we must be anti-racist,” Ms Chu said. She recalled how her mother Stella came from a family in Hong Kong that “was not well off,” and she would sell flowers in a market after school. She moved to Ireland in the 1970s and “worked night and day washing dishes in a restaurant off O’Connell Street, dreaming of a better future for her own daughter,” she said. “I wonder as I sit here if she dreamt her daughter would become the ninth female Lord Mayor of this great city,” Ms Chu said. Ms Chu said she had a dream for her own two-year-old daughter Alex, that she would grow up to “celebrate her ersity rather than being ashamed of it.”Ending her acceptance speech Ms Chu said she would like to thank her mother, “who worked endlessly to give us the future she never had.”Social Democrats councillor Mary Callaghan was elected deputy Lord Mayor with 43 votes, to nine cast for Fine Gael councillor Terence Flanagan, with several abstentions. Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon nominated Ms Chu at the meeting, who he said would be the first person of colour to hold the post, and would represent a Dublin “which is changing.” “Hazel’s election as a woman and person of Chinese heritage would be an important step in sending a progressive message to some groups who need to hear it,” he said. Fine Gael had nominated Ms Feeney for the role, who was first co-opted onto the council after Kate O’Connell’s election to the Dáil in 2016 and was re-elected to the council last year. Ms Chu was elected to the position as part of a voting pact agreed between Fianna Fáil, the Greens, Labour and the Social Democrats, which included rotating the role of Lord Mayor. Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe was the first elected Lord Mayor under the deal, called the Dublin Agreement. Ms Chu takes over from Fianna Fáil councillor Tom Brabazon, who replaced Mr McAuliffe after his election to the Dáil. Green wave Ms Chu was one of 49 councillors elected for the party among the “Green wave” during the 2019 local elections. Ms Chu studied history and politics in University College Dublin, where she was involved in running debating championships and the Philosophy Society. She then went on to graduate from King’s Inns, but to date has not practiced as a barrister. Since her election to the council Ms Chu has been a high profile media performer for the party, and has frequently spoken out against racist abuse she receives on social media. Her partner is Green Party TD Patrick Costello, and they have a two-year-old daughter Alex. She got involved with the Greens after managing Mr Costello’s successful local election campaign in 2014. In the aftermath of the party’s electoral wipeout following its last stint in government, the canvassing team often consisted of just the two of them. Following her spectacular performance at the local elections, there was speculation that she might stand as a running mate to party leader Eamon Ryan in the Dublin Bay South constituency, but amid fears that this strategy could split the vote dangerously and elect neither – or cost Ryan his seat – the plan never got off the ground. Nor was Ms Chu successful in a bid to be one of the party’s Seanad candidates this year. Relations with Mr Ryan are said to be cool since, and Ms Chu was one of the most prominent party figures who opposed entering coalition with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, part of a group that included Mr Costello, Neasa Hourigan and deputy leader Catherine Martin’s husband, Francis Noel Duffy. However, they are part of the mainstream of the party, rather than from the anti-government extremes such as former candidate Saoirse McHugh and Cork councillor Lorna Bogue.Previously she worked as head of corporate communications for Diageo Ireland, who produce Guinness, Smithwick’s, and Smirnoff vodka. Ms Chu has more than €12,000 in shares in the drinks producer, according to ethics declarations filed with DCC last year. The shares were acquired as part of a bonus scheme structure and an employee saving scheme.She has also previously worked for St Michael’s House and Electric Picnic, and in 2009 volunteered for six months as a teacher in a school in rural China. The role of Lord Mayor has been held by politicians from immigrant backgrounds on a number of occasions in the past.Former Fianna Fáil TD Robert Briscoe, whose family came to Ireland as Lithuanian Jewish immigrants, held the title on two occasions in the mid-1950s and early 1960s. Two brothers, Jean Desmynieres and Louis Desmynieres, were members of a French Huguenot family who both held the title in the late 1660s."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291676.1593456587!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"travellers have fought for over 30 years to be around political table new seanad told","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Travellers’ rights activist and now Senator Eileen Flynn. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw Newly appointed Traveller rights activist Senator Eileen Flynn has said she wants to be the person to “break down barriers for Traveller people and for those at the end of Irish society”.Addressing the first meeting of the new Seanad Ms Flynn said that for “over 30 years Travellers have fought to be around the political table and to be heard”.She said they “finally” had a voice in Seanad Éireann and “we do need a voice”.Ms Flynn who was just two votes shy of winning a seat in the April election for the Upper House received a round of applause for her debut speech at the first meeting of the new Seanad on Monday, held at the Convention Centre Dublin, to comply with social distancing regulations.The only non-party figure among the 11 nominees, she came close to a seat in the Seanad vocational panel election in April. From Ballyfermot in Dublin but living in Donegal, she said she wanted to be a “voice for those at the very end of society.The new Senator said “I look forward to working with everybody and hopefully we can all learn from each other and hopefully I’ll be that person that will break down the barriers for Traveller people and also for those at the end of Irish society”.In a lengthy session at which a majority of the 60 Senators spoke, the House also elected Fianna Fáil Senator Mark Daly as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad by 46 votes to six in the Upper House.Mr Daly was sacked as deputy leader of the House in 2018 when he and TD Éamon Ó Cuív took part in the unsanctioned election launch for the party of a candidate in Fermanagh.He was the surprise victor in a three-way internal Fianna Fáil contest for the nomination, against outgoing cathaoirleach Denis O’Donovan and Diarmuid Wilson at a meeting of the party’s 20 Senators.Mr Daly’s victory after an assiduous campaign came as a surprise to many in what was described as a “tight” vote but one Fianna Fáil Senator said the party needed to assert its identity and “Mark best filled that vision”. Another Senator said “Denis O’Donovan and Diarmuid Wilson are lifelong friends but were like two bulls in a field and neither would give way and Mark Daly slipped through the gap”. Mr Daly has consistently called for the Government to prepare for a poll on a united Ireland and has written numerous reports on the issue. He is also a regular visitor to the US campaigning on the rights of undocumented Irish.He was nominated by party Seanad leader Lisa Chambers in the plenary session. There was a formal vote because Sinn Féin nominated Belfast-based Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile but Mr Daly was assured of victory because the three parties Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Green Party had a majority.The post went to Fianna Fáil following the decision to make former minister and Taoiseach’s appointee Regina Doherty leader of the Upper House.Sinn Féin Senator Niall O Donnghaile the party’s nominee for cathaoirleach said he was “deeply disappointed” at the Government’s failure to include Unionist voices and had expected to see unionist former senator Ian Marshall return as an appointee.His criticism was echoed by a number of Senators. Independent Gerard Craughwell accused the Government of favouring “political loyals at the expense of the marginalised” and “party over people”.The House met to deal with emergency anti-terrorist and crime-gang legislation that had to be renewed by midnight."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4290693.1593296152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"who is in the new cabinet members in profile","story":"Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has been elected Taoiseach by 93 votes to 63, with three abstentions, in a historic Dáil vote which has taken place in Dublin’s Convention Centre. Video: Oireachtas TV\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party deputy leader Catherine Martin is now Minister   for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht.A new Taoiseach was elected on Saturday and a range of new Ministers were appointed. Here’s all you need to know about them:He became party leader in 2011 just weeks before the general election when Fianna Fáil lost 51 seats in the fall-out from the economic collapse. The five wilderness years were spent reorganising the party and its decimated cohort of TDs.In 2016, Fianna Fáil had a mini-revival, regaining 23 seats and in the 2019 local elections won the most seats of any party. The four years since were spent building up a still volatile parliamentary party but Fianna Fáil suffered further losses in the 2020 election and dropped six seats, partially blamed on the party’s confidence and supply agreement with Fine Gael.The 2020 election had become do or die for Martin, whose Cork South-Central constituency will now be home to three Cabinet members - himself as Taoiseach, his party colleague Michael McGrath and former tánaiste Simon Coveney.The first Cork Taoiseach for 41 years since Jack Lynch, he has been a TD since 1989, served on Fianna Fáil’s front bench since 1995 and held four senior government portfolios during the party’s time in office - foreign affairs, health, education and enterprise.Single-minded and driven with a huge work ethic, the pragmatic Martin can be sensitive to criticism. A good media performer he is however seen by some within the party as distant and colleagues are hoping that communications within the party will improve.Health conscious and very proud of introducing the smoking ban in Ireland, he has pushed the Public Health (Alcohol) Act despite the reluctance of rural TDs within the party.Leo Varadkar, Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and EmploymentAfter a terrible election result and what appeared initially to be a guaranteed trip across the Dáil to the opposition benches, Leo Varadkar’s fortunes have been transformed along with those of his party.His calm and assured leadership performance through the coronavirus pandemic combined with a lengthy stalemate over coalition formation talks have resulted in Fine Gael soaring from losers to clear victors in the opinion polls and with Varadkar moving from spent political force back to key player.Nobody has batted an eyelid at the fact that he will preside over the party’s abandonment of its Civil War stance after a century and move into a historic government coalition with Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.Even less remarked on has been his demotion to Tánaiste for over two years as Fine Gael participates in the previously vilified notion of rotating taoiseach. But he also leads his party into an unprecedented third term in office.A social agenda trailblazer, he is Ireland’s first openly gay minister, the State’s youngest taoiseach and is now Tánaiste. The son of an Irish mother and Indian father, his qualification as a doctor helped during the pandemic and assured him of good publicity when he decided to re-register as a medic and said he would do half a day a week on the helpline for people who suspected they had the Covid-19 virus.Never one to shy away from a photo opportunity, the 41-year-old was also the first taoiseach to assiduously use social media to push his message and his carefully cultivated image. And he got into the much discussed habit during lockdown of quoting a variety of books, films and other media in his speeches.He has also used his speeches to throw out provocative messages reflecting his economic views including his oft quoted controversial remark that Fine Gael should represent those who “get up early in the morning”.He previously served as minister for social protection, for transport and for health and now moves into the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. But it remains to be seen if he will innovate rather than merely manage as he was perceived to have done in his previous portfolios.Michael McGrath - Minister for Public Expenditure and ReformWhen political heavy hitter Michael McGrath (43) became Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesman, then minister for finance Michael Noonan pronounced that the accountant had a big future ahead of him in politics.That future has finally arrived for the Cork South-Central TD who has been finance spokesman since 2011, when Fine Gael was in coalition with Labour and again when Fine Gael relied on Independents and Fianna Fáil’s confidence and supply arrangement.First elected to the Dáil in 2007 he has retained his seat at each subsequent election. It has been a long road for the man who will finally take the helm at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.A constituency rival and colleague of his party leader he is seen as a potential successor, is well liked by his party colleagues and has a well-oiled constituency machine.Originally from Passage West but now living in Carrigaline with his wife Sarah O’Brien and seven children, he secured a first-class honours commerce degree in UCC and qualified as a chartered accountant with KPMG in Cork City.A central member of the party’s negotiating team in the government formation talks, he is a low-key, calm and effective spokesman.Stephen Donnelly - Minister for HealthThe appointment of Stephen Donnelly to Cabinet makes it two Ministers for Health in a row for his Wicklow constituency taking the baton from Simon Harris. It is a job often seen as a political crucifixion for the holder.Elected to the Dáil as an Independent on his first attempt in 2011, he went on to form the Social Democrats with Róisín Shortall and Catherine Murphy in 2015 and surged to a poll-topping performance in Wicklow in 2016.Shortly afterwards however, he left the party following disagreements with his co-leaders.In the Dáil he has since had a number of disagreements with the Social Democrats on the much lauded Sláintecare plan and all eyes will be keenly watching how he deals with the much debated health roadmap.After a short second  as an Independent he joined Fianna Fáil in 2017. While party leader Micheál Martin saw his recruitment as a major coup, his arrival left many noses out of joint in Fianna Fáil. Those tensions and the move, appeared to dent his 2020 election chances but he was elected on the 15th count.Darragh O’Brien, Minister for Housing, Local Government and HeritageAnother member of the Fianna Fáil negotiating team to get a seat at the big table Darragh O’Brien (45) becomes Minister for Housing in the new three-party Government.Party spokesman on housing, planning and local government in the last Dáil, he was first elected to the Dáil in 2007. He lost out in the 2011 decimation of the party in the economic recession. He became one of 51 party TDs to be defeated at the hands of angry voters. He successfully ran for the Seanad that year on the Labour panel and became Seanad leader, keeping a place in the Oireachtas.But his Dáil defeat had a salutary effect, resulting in him building up a strong constituency base with his brother as a local councillor. It may have contributed to local party tensions with Dublin Fingal colleague Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee.He went on to top the poll in Dublin Fingal in the 2016 general election.Before entering politics he worked in the financial services sector for 15 years as an area manager with Life Assurance Company.He was elected to Fingal County Council in 2004 before successfully contesting a Dáil seat in 2007.He is married with a young family.Barry Cowen, Minister for Agriculture and the MarineThe no-nonsense Fianna Fáil spokesman on public expenditure and reform Barry Cowen (52) has been appointed Minister for Agriculture. The man who sealed the fate of the water charges in the 2016 government formation negotiations, was again a key member of the negotiating team this time round.The 2016 talks led to the confidence and supply arrangement with Fine Gael but left Fianna Fáil out of government. The intense five-week\u0026nbspcampaign in 2020 led to government and the reward of a seat at the top table for the Clara, Co Offaly native.A brother of former taoiseach Brian Cowen he has been spokesman in a number of portfolios since his election to the Dáil in 2011. As well as spokesman on public expenditure and reform he also held the position of spokesman on environment and local government and on social protection.A married father of four, he was first elected to Offaly county council in 1999, where he served until his election to the Dáil to the seat vacated by his brother.A member of the Cowen family has represented Offaly in the Dáil continuously since 1977. His father Bernard Cowen was elected in 1969 but lost his seat in 1973. He regained it in 1977 and held it until his death in 1984.Norma Foley, Minister for EducationKerry TD Norma Foley, who nominated her party leader Micheál Martin to be Taoiseach has been appointed Minister for Education, five months after her election to the Dáil for the first time.Martin is said to prefer TDs to have done at least a term on the backbenches but the new TD who is a teacher by profession, has shown herself to be an impressive performer and has been effective at the Covid-19 committee in the questioning of witnesses. Calm, courteous and well prepared, she has a great grasp of detail and the bigger picture.The Tralee native took the fifth and final seat in the general election in Kerry, edging out her running mate and outgoing TD John Brassil.It is her second run at the Dáil, having been on the Fianna Fáil ticket in the 2007 election, when she was selected over Brassil.Since 2004, Foley has represented the people of Tralee Municipal District on Kerry County Council, topping the poll in last May’s local elections.She has also served on Tralee Town Council, and held the position of mayor of Tralee on three occasions, most recently in 20172018. In 20182019 she served as mayor of Kerry.She is the daughter of the late Denis Foley, who served as a TD for the constituency for 18 years, broken up by a three-year stint as a senator. He was named as the holder of an undisclosed offshore Ansbacher account.She is married to fellow teacher Denis Maguire.Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and DefenceHe may have lost his role as tánaiste but Simon Coveney (48) has retained the much coveted position of Minister for Foreign Affairs. Greatly admired by departmental staff as probably the hardest working minister in that portfolio, he has received much acclaim for his efforts in dealing with Brexit and is seen as the driving political force in Ireland securing its temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council.Loved by the party’s grassroots and accessible to TDs and Senators, he still retains ambitions to be party leader and is seen as likely to get there. A cautious and moderate politician, his tearaway teenage years when he was expelled from Clongowes school for drinking and partying, before being asked back – are at odds with his later serious image.From Cork’s so-called merchant class and a keen rugby and sailing fan, he has a degree in agriculture and land management and was catapulted into the world of politics following the death of his father Hugh, a TD and former minister, in 1998.He later successfully ran for the European Parliament in 2004 but returned to Ireland for the 2007 general election and he has successfully retained his seat since. He served as minister for agriculture for all five years of the Enda Kenny-led administration from 2011 later adding defence to his portfolio when Eamon Gilmore resigned as tánaiste.From 2016 he spent just a year as minister for housing, when his pledge to end all emergency hotel and B\u0026ampB\u0026nbspaccommodation backfired, before he moved to the hallowed halls of the Department of Foreign Affairs.Seen as open in his approach and meticulous in his work practices, he has risen solidly and steadily through the party’s ranks and his experience in Brexit talks paved the way for his central role in the government formation talks.Paschal Donohoe, Minister for FinanceAs soon as Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe confirmed he was putting his name forward as a unity candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, it was clear he was confident of returning to his office in Merrion Street.Ever cautious and highly political he would have been slow to put his reputation on the line without some assurance of keeping his own job while he applied for the top spot in the influential club of finance ministers from countries that use the euro.The deadline for that role came a day before the outcome of the vote on the programme for government.He is highly popular within the party although less so after his poison chalice position as director of elections for both the Dáil and Seanad elections.The electorate proved less than happy with the party’s budgetary and spending policies and Fine Gael lost 12 Dáil seats. It was also embarrassed by the failure to have any women elected to the Upper House.Nine years a TD for Dublin Central, the 45-year-old has held the finance portfolio since 2017. He previously served as a minister of state and then as minister for transport.A central member of the party’s leadership and key to the government formation talks he is viewed as culturally one of the more rounded Cabinet members with an interest in books, film and theatre.The former sales manager with a multinational firm will need all his skills as a party persuader and negotiator to navigate the traumatic economic conditions facing the State while keeping faith with his wary Fianna Fáil and suspicious Green Party colleagues.He will be happy to leave his one stated regret – not managing to control the costs of the new national children’s hospital – to Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath who takes up the re-ided Department of Public Expenditure and Reform portfolio.He is married with two children and lives in Phibsborough, Dublin.Heather Humphreys, Minister for Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the IslandsOne of the Ministers always seen as sure of keeping her seat at the cabinet table, Heather Humphreys fits the criteria for geography, gender and ability.A border-county TD, she was the first woman elected to the Cavan-Monaghan constituency in 2011, when she took over from fellow Presbyterian Fine Gael colleague Seymour Crawford.Now in her third Dáil term and one of three female TDs in the five-seat constituency, she is highly regarded within Fine Gael and viewed as capable and a safe pair of hands.A first-term backbench TD when she was appointed to cabinet in 2011 as minister for arts, heritage and the Gaeltacht she won plaudits for her stewardship of the successful 1916 Rising centenary commemorations.A loyal ally of former taoiseach Enda Kenny she was re-appointed to the portfolio by him in 2016 but was one of the first Ministers to declare her support for Leo Varadkar in the 2017 leadership contest.He promoted her to the Business, Enterprise and Innovation portfolio in 2017 following the resignation of tánaiste Frances Fitzgerald.A business background through her work with Ulster Bank and as manager of Cootehill Credit Union also helped secure her appointment. The coronavirus pandemic brought her biggest political challenge with the crisis facing thousands of businesses and leaving a 25 per cent unemployment rate. Grant and income support schemes, loans and other initiatives have helped cushion the initial blow.The Government will now have to deal with the fallout from a controversial High Court judgment striking out a sectoral employment order and ruling that she had acted outside her powers in making the order for the electrical industry.Her career in finance, experience as minister for business and farming background in Co Monaghan, where she is married with two adult daughters, make her a good candidate for the rural development portfolio.Elected for the first time in the 2011 general election, she lives in Aghabog, near Monaghan town, and her family is from the Cavan-Monaghan border area.Helen McEntee, Minister for JusticeA reserved but smart politician Helen McEntee (33) from Castletown, Co Meath, has been a TD since 2013 when she won the byelection following the death of her father Shane McEntee.Minister of State for European Affairs since 2017, the Meath East TD proved her mettle in the ever present and fraught Brexit crisis, leading the Government’s response on a number of related issues.She has been described as Leo Varadkar’s “secret weapon” and is considered level-headed and a very good negotiator. Former president of the European Council Donald Tusk called her “diligent” and an “exceptional diplomat”. She is one of 10 vice-presidents of the European People’s Party, Fine Gael’s centre-right representative grouping in the EU.Graduating from DCU in 2007 having studied law, politics and economics, she worked briefly in a Citibank subsidiary. She later completed a masters in journalism and communications and worked with her father in Leinster House, first in opposition and then when he was appointed minister of state.A supporter of Varadkar’s from the start she has been by his side throughout the Brexit crisis and has a keen understanding of its intricacies and complexities.Simon Harris, Minister for Higher Education, Innovation and ScienceDespite his increased stature during the coronavirus pandemic as minister for health Simon Harris (33) became a focus of increasing speculation in recent days that he would be demoted from Cabinet.In the fateful 2017 Fine Gael leadership campaign he took sides early on in favour of Simon Coveney as opposed to Varadkar but held onto the health portfolio Kenny appointed him to in 2016.Described as the “teenage” minister when first appointed to the hugely significant but poison chalice department, he has visibly aged in the past three months through the stresses of the Covid-19 crisis.He remained a popular choice in his Wicklow constituency in the election despite concerns about a shortage of hospital beds, the spiralling cost of the new national children’s hospital and the recruitment and retention difficulties around healthcare staff.Those issues disappeared during the pandemic with the unprecedented takeover of all private hospitals and the return home of emigrant doctors and nurses to assist with the crisis.These problems have re-emerged but are no longer an issue for Harris as he moves on from the department described as a war zone.A social media expert, he is one of the party’s top media performers, assured and persuasive in his delivery, accessible and generally guaranteed to avoid political gaffes.He first became engaged in politics while campaigning for his younger brother and other children with autism. He topped the poll in the local elections and secured the highest vote in the country through his social media campaign.While a councillor, he approached then Seanad leader Frances Fitzgerald, became her parliamentary assistant and moved into Leinster House politics from there.Viewed as having an uneasy relationship with his party leader he is far from the inner circle. He is married with one child and lives in Greystones, Co Wicklow.Eamon Ryan - Minister for Climate Action, Communications Networks and TransportIt has been a torrid few months for Green Party leader Eamon Ryan (56) as he enters Government with a deeply scarred and ided party.In all the controversy the spectacular success in winning 12 seats in the general election has been all but forgotten.Now appointed to his long sought role in climate action and transport he will have little time to relish the challenge as he bids to heal the schism within the party.It is a reflection of the party’s isions that when he was mired in controversy after repeating a racial slur in the Dáil that it took a minister from another party, Charlie Flanagan of Fine Gael to publicly defend the Dublin Bay South TD by saying he did not have a racist bone in his body.But through all the accusations, insults and recriminations he has been calm, conciliatory and with party deputy leader Catherine Martin has persuaded the party’s membership to decisively back an unprecedented government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.He now faces a leadership contest against his deputy leader but has remained sanguine about the prospect.An impassioned speaker prone to gaffes, including a call during the election campaign for the re-introduction of wolves, he nonetheless led a team to rebuild the party after its disastrous first foray into coalition government after which it lost all six Dáil seats.A councillor before his 2007 election to the Dáil he previously ran a bicycle shop and cycling holiday business.He is married to journalist Victoria White and they have four sons.Catherine Martin - Minister for Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the GaeltachtDublin Rathdown TD and deputy Green party leader Catherine Martin (47) emerged as a surprising contender for the top job in the party.Her stance on coalition has strained the previously close working relationship with Eamon Ryan but his move to appoint her as lead negotiator in the coalition talks was seen as an inspired move.Cautious by nature, she is said to seek advice widely and does not say things lightly. Some in her party are said to find it hard to gauge where she stands and those on the other side of the negotiating table have described her as an enigma.As an influential voice in the party she will have a significant role in attempting to heal the party’s schism.From her first days in the Dáil she forged good relations across all parties and founded the Irish Women’s Parliamentary Caucus in the Oireachtas, pressed for anti-bullying protocols in the Leinster House campus.From Carrickmacross, Co Monaghan she trained as a classical singer and after graduating from NUI Maynooth, she taught music and English at St Tiernan’s Community School in Ballinteer.Her initial foray into politics was when she was co-opted to her brother Vincent P Martin’s council seat in Monaghan in the 1990s. She returned to politics in Dublin, was elected as a councillor in 2014 and came from nowhere to win a Dáil seat in 2016.Her husband Francis Noel Duffy became a TD in 2020 and took an opposing view in rejecting the coalition deal. The couple has three children.Roderic O’Gorman - Minister for Children, Disability, Equality and IntegrationLong predicted to make the high table Roderic O’Gorman (38) is one of the Green party’s most experienced politicians. His victory in the 2020 general election marked his 10th foray in 15 years including four general elections, two byelections and four local elections. The party’s justice and equality spokesman he was on the negotiating team and insisted in the talks that the coalition must make a commitment to end direct provision.A former chairman of the party he served from 2011 to 2019.From Tyrellstown he lives with his partner Ray Healy in Blanchardstown. A lecturer at the Brexit Institute and School of Law and Government in DCU he is a graduate of Trinity College and the London School of Economics.Close to both party leader Ryan and deputy leader Martin he is courteous, considered and reflective in his deliberations and well regarded across the party. He is a fan of TV shows West Wing, Game of Thrones and Arrested Development.Hildegarde Naughton - Minister of State at the Department of Climate Action, she will be attending CabinetOne of the survivors of the electoral cull of Fine Gael TDs, Hildegarde Naughton (43) has consistently grown in experience and stature since she first arrived on the political stage in 2009.That was the year the former schoolteacher was first elected to Galway City Council, becoming mayor two years later. Mentored and promoted by then taoiseach Enda Kenny, the Galway West TD was appointed to the Seanad in 2013.In 2016 she seized the chance to get on the Fine Gael ticket in the general election after Barry Walsh stepped aside from politics on health grounds.Chair of the Oireachtas Committee for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment in the last Dáil she fought the green fight in an uphill and forthright battle to persuade many reluctant party colleagues to the cause and has been Fine Gael’s leading environmentalist.That role, that experience and her capability has brought her to the Cabinet table - along with the need to have some gender balance at cabinet and take account of geographical considerations.Outside politics she is a talented singer who has performed and won awards for her roles in musical theatre. While a senator she established a group called Bel Canto with two other sopranos, who sang at charity events. She has described her musical interest as “my golf”.Pippa Hackett, “Super Junior” Minister of StateGreen Party Senator Pippa Hackett’s appointment as a “Super Junior” Minister of State is the first appointment of a Senator to Cabinet since the early 1980s.She takes on the role of Minister of State for Agriculture with responsibility for land use and bioersity.Her appointment has taken some by surprise amid speculation that someone among the party’s TDs might be selected.A farmer from Offaly and the party’s agriculture spokeswoman, she was elected to the Seanad in a byelection in November when a vacancy arose following the election of then Senator Grace O’Sullivan to the European parliament.But the move is as much a surprise because it is virtually unprecedented.The last time a Senator took on a ministerial role was in 1981 when then taoiseach Garrett FitzGerald nominated Senator James Dooge as minister for foreign affairs, a portfolio he held for a year.A vocal supporter of the programme for government, Hackett was elected unopposed to the agricultural panel in the Seanad when the other parties opted not to contest the seat.Formerly an Offaly county councillor she lost out in the general election for the Laois-Offaly constituency when she was eliminated in the final round.Originally from Ballandine, Co Mayo she is married with four children and lives in Edenderry, Co Offaly.Dara Calleary - Chief whipNew Government chief whip Dara Calleary has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. The Mayo TD who has been in the Dáil since 2007 and is the son of late TD and former minister of state Sean Calleary who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992. His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, popular with party colleagues he is deputy leader and viewed as a safe pair of hands.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil, Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics he has served as the party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation.Paul Gallagher SC, Attorney GeneralThis will be Paul Gallagher’s second time in the job, having previously served from 2007 to 2011. During his first term, he was called to offer legal advice on some of the biggest issues ever to face an Irish government, including the bank guarantee scheme, the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency and the International Monetary Fund Troika programme.He is regarded as one of Ireland’s top barristers, with a fearsome work ethic."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Washington plans to target Chinese officials undermining Asian financial hub autonomyJustin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the \u0026lsquoarbitrary detention\u0026rsquo of two CanadiansMany were struck as they were planting seeds across Bihar state in east of countryThe decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4291905.1593457074!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandemic is speeding up and is not even close to being over who says","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation: ‘We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives.’ Photograph: Salvatore Di NolfiEPATracing contacts of people with coronavirus infections is the most important step in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, and countries that are failing to do so have no excuse, the World Health Organisation chief said on Monday.“Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,” Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing.“We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over,” he said. “Most people remain susceptible, the virus still has a lot of room to move.”Countries such as South Korea had managed to contain the disease by tracking down the contacts of those carrying infection, Dr Tedros said. This was possible even under extreme conditions, as the WHO itself had shown by halting an outbreak of Ebola in eastern Congo, tracing 25,000 contacts a day in a remote area where some 20 armed groups were fighting, he added.“No excuse for contact tracing. If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse.”OriginsIn a move sought by the WHO’s biggest critic, the United States, Dr Tedros announced that a team would be sent to China next week to investigate the origins of the outbreak.“We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,” Dr Tedros said. “We will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that.”US president Donald Trump and secretary of state Mike Pompeo have both said the disease could have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although they have presented no evidence of this, and China denies it. Scientists say the virus emerged in nature.Mr Trump has announced plans to quit the WHO, which he says is too close to China. He has repeatedly emphasised the Chinese origins of the virus, calling it “Kung Flu” at two rallies this month, a term the White House had previously described as unacceptable and which Asian-American groups say is racist.‘Mutual respect’Asked about Mr Trump’s use of the term, the director of the WHO’s emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, called for an “international discourse that is based on mutual respect”.“Many people around the world have used unfortunate language in this response,” he said.Mr Ryan said there had been tremendous progress towards finding a vaccine, but there was no guarantee of success. In the meantime countries must use the strategies available, such as social distancing and contact tracing.“Many, many countries through applying a comprehensive strategy have reached a very low level of virus transmission in their countries but always have to remain vigilant in case there are clusters or small outbreaks.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the

stricter lockdown due to covid 19 spike","story":"The city of Leicester must go back into a stricter lockdown because its Covid-19 infection rate was much higher than anywhere else in the country, UK health secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Monday.Non-essential shops in Leicester will close from Tuesday and schools will close to most pupils from Thursday as part of restrictions imposed after a rise in cases, Mr Hancock told MPs.He said the easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on July 4th cannot happen in Leicester because of rising cases.He said: “Given the growing outbreak in Leicester we cannot recommend that the easing of the national lockdown set to take place on July 4th happens in Leicester.”This means pubs, hairdressers and restaurants will not be able to open this week.The health secretary said Leicester accounted for about 10 per cent of all positive cases in the UK over the past week, and that the seven-day infection rate there was 135 cases per 100,000 people, three times higher than the next highest city.Mr Hancock advised people from Leicester to stay at home as much as they can while the local lockdown measures continue.He told MPs: “Having taken clinical advice on the actions necessary and discussed them with the local team in Leicester and Leicestershire, we have made some difficult but important decisions.“We’ve decided that from tomorrow, non-essential retail will have to close and as children have been particularly impacted by this outbreak, schools will also need to close from Thursday, staying open for vulnerable children and children of critical workers as they did throughout.“Unfortunately, the clinical advice is that the relaxation of shielding measures due on July 6th cannot now take place in Leicester.“We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.“We’ll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and we’ll take further steps if that is what’s necessary.”He said the measures would be kept under review and would not be kept in place “any longer than is necessary”, adding: “We’ll review if we can release any of the measures in two weeks.“These Leicester-specific measures will apply not just to the city of Leicester but also the surrounding conurbation including, for example, Oadby, Birstall and Glenfield.“I know that this is a worrying time for people living in Leicester and I want you to know you have our full support.“We do not take these decisions lightly but with the interests of the people of Leicester in our hearts.”Mr Hancock announced further measures in Leicester to help tackle the outbreak, including the setting up of a walk-in testing centre for those with coronavirus symptoms.He said: “Anyone in Leicester with symptoms must come forward for a test.” – PAReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with

democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"no thing cultural appropriation","story":"Honed by months of waiting, my post-lockdown fantasy has now become highly specific. I want a quiet table in the corner of the Kennington Tandoori. I want a nice lamb rogan josh and a bottle of Château Musar. And I want to be left alone. But left alone I will not be, especially if I am foolish enough to take my phone – and thus Twitter – with me. Because the recipe has become the newest battleground over claims of cultural appropriation.New York Times food columnist and Bon Appétit magazine writer Alison Roman is the latest to fall foul of the social justice police. She stands accused, amongst other heinous sins, of making a curry without properly crediting its cultural provenance. Bon Appétit’s research director was forced to step in to apologise for “decontextualising recipes from non-white cultures”. On this side of the pond, meanwhile, BBC Good Food is busy reviewing its vast archive of recipes, removing or amending any exhibiting unacceptable “broad-brush” language, such as “Asian salad”.Oh, for goodness sake. What next? Perhaps my love of a good curry and Lebanese red wine – both obvious candidates to be cancelled, both clearly in need of emergency decolonising? After all, it was empire that brought the curry to Britain, and French winemaking to the Beqaa Valley.But cultural appropriation is, of course, a nonsense criticism. All cultures weave in and out of each other and that of their neighbours. There are no pure origins, none hermetically sealed to the outside. In their glorious recipe book Jerusalem, Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi argue “the complexity and vibrancy of the food in Jerusalem stems from its location as a meeting point between Europe, Asia and Africa and the incredible richness of its history”. Go back far enough, and everything is fusion. Cultural appropriation is a weirdly negative way of describing something that is essentially a jolly good thing: learning from each other.No, that doesn’t mean that it is fine to take aspects of another culture and hold them up to ridicule. But we need not invent new moral categories to find blackface unacceptable or even to criticise those who borrow from another person’s sacred scriptures to create an exotic looking tattoo. Such things are already covered by the ideas of respect and stupidity, respectively.Yet some people just cannot help themselves. Writing in the latest edition of Bon Appétit, Joseph Hernandez turns the lens upon his own magazine, believing some deep moral blasphemy has been committed by the author of a recipe for the Filipino dessert halo-halo that included the very un-Filipino ingredients of gummy bears and popcorn. “What it normalises is a white culture,” he writes, “that sees everything foreign to it as a spectacle, something to be tamed and translated to an audience that can’t understand it.” Needless to say, Hernandez argues that these recipes must fall. And that – my translation here – our taste buds require decolonialising.Woke is a merciless philosophy. It specialises in sniffing out people’s moral failings in the smallest of things, imagining that the slightest slip must indicate some profound or pernicious inner prejudice. The ludicrous thing is that it often misses – or deliberately seeks to avoid – deeper moral issues. For instance, instead of gummy bears, he could have mentioned that sugar itself was the white gold powering the slave trade addiction to sweet desserts tempted many of our ancestors to turn a blind eye to the evils of slavery.Yet the micro-aggressions of misplaced gummy bears are the least of their worries over at Bon Appétit. Last month, the editor-in-chief resigned after a photograph surfaced on social media showing him dressed up for a Hallowe’en party in some apparently hilarious parody of a Puerto Rican gangster, complete with a heavy fake tan. He had just written an earnest editorial about the need for the food industry to respond positively to the death of George Floyd. A few days later, he was accused by one of the Bon Appétit writers of discriminating against people of colour at work. He resigned soon after.If he was treating colleagues badly, then rightly so. But the accusation of cultural appropriation – as opposed to plain disrespect – is such an unhelpful addition to our moral vocabulary. Back in 2001, the then Labour foreign secretary Robin Cook famously praised the way in which chicken tikka masala had not only become our national dish but also “a perfect illustration of the way Britain absorbs and adapts external influences”.Isn’t it telling how quickly public morality has shifted? These days, absorbing and adapting external influences is regarded as something shameful, insufficiently respectful of difference. But Cook was right.Learning from others is messy and complicated. It flows through war and trade, as well as love across cultural ides. And an adventurous and free-spirited cultural exchange may get things wrong all the time. But that is precisely how creativity works, and especially in the kitchen. Giles Fraser is a columnist at UnHerdMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"air bridge plan jeopardy greece suspends holiday flights uk","story":"Britain’s air bridge plans were in danger of being undermined yesterday as Greece banned British holiday flights until the middle of July.Greece announced it was suspending all direct flights from the UK and Sweden until July 15 because of the epidemiological data on the state of the Coronavirus pandemic in both countries.Ireland also signalled that Britain is unlikely to be on its “green list” of countries under which travellers will be exempted from its 14-day quarantine from July 9 because of the UK’s “very high” incidence of Coronavirus.And Nicola Sturgeon warned she will consider introducing quarantine for English visitors to Scotland if the number of coronavirus cases south of the Border surges. She said she had no plans at present for restrictions on cross-Border travel but added: I\u0027m not ruling anything out.The moves come just days before Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is due to unveil a list of more than 50 countries where he plans air bridges to allow British holidaymakers to avoid having to self-isolate for 14 days on their return.Greece along with France and Spain was named by the Government last Friday as one of the chosen 50 destinations earmarked for quarantine-free holidays from July 6. The number of searches for Greek holidays trebled as a result over the weekend.However, announcing plans to open the country to international travellers from July 1, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis specifically excluded flights from Britain and Sweden, scuppering holiday plans.The whole opening process is ongoing and the data will be constantly evaluated, he said.Travel firms warned it added to the confusion and uncertainty for families seeking to plan foreign holidays, while one Conservative MP said it “drove a coach and horses” through the Government’s quarantine policy.Ireland is expected to announce its “green list” of countries on July 9 which is understood to include Spain, Greece, Portugal, Malta and Croatia.However, the Irish taoiseach Leo Veradkar warned that if the decision was made now, travellers from Britain with its “very high incidences of infection” would still face quarantine - even though Irish people travelling from the republic to the UK do not have self-isolate.Dr Tony Holohan, Ireland’s chief medical officer, said its green list would be countries with similarly low infection rates. Ireland had two cases on Sunday compared with the UK’s 900. We are beyond nervous. We are concerned about travel as a potential source of infection for this country,” he said.Denmark has also unexpectedly kept the UK, Ireland, Romania and Malta on its “quarantine” list of countries, in retaliation for their own restrictions.  By contrast, the Czech republic announced yesterday that Britain would be on a green list exempting visitors from quarantine. However, it banned Sweden on “red” and put Portugal on “amber.”  Britain is also threatening to exclude Portugal from its air bridges after an outbreak of Coronavirus in and around Lisbon that has forced a new lockdown in 19 parishes.  Rowland Paterson, executive director of the Ultimate Travel Company, said the holiday landscape was changing “almost by the hour” as he warned people against booking prematurely.He said Greece appeared to be as guilty as the UK of making policy on the hoof. He added: Until there is agreement and something in writing, it would be precipitous or too risky for people to book a holiday to one of these countries.”Henry Smith, the Conservative chair of the cross-party Future of Aviation Group, said the Greek decision “drives a coach and horses through the quarantine. That is disappointing. I think it is a retrograde step but a country needs to do what they think is in their public health interests.”Paul Charles, chief executive of PC Consultancy, which specialises in travel advice, said: “Greece is signalling they want to be certain there is little to no risk letting UK travellers in. By giving it another two weeks, they are buying time to help the British prove that Covid is completely under control.”It also emerged yesterday that a British couple had become the first people to be fined £100 under the quarantine laws for refusing to fill in their locator forms when they were stopped at Coquelles in France. The pair will be referred to police to ensure they self-isolate.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"philippines could see unplanned baby boom families unable access","story":"More than 214,000 extra babies could be born in the Philippines next year as strict coronavirus lockdowns have left hundreds of thousands unable to access family planning services.It is thought that around 10 per cent of the unplanned pregnancies will be among teenagers aged 15-19, according to the country\u0027s Commission on Population and Development (Popcom).The spike in births - expected to be the highest in two decades - has been caused by restrictions on movement preventing access to clinics, and the lack of availability of contraceptives, like condoms, in the wake of the pandemic.Nearly 3.6m women aged between 15 and 49 years old have had an “unmet need for family planning” in the outbreak, Popcom said, almost a fifth more than usual.  “We foresee that because of the restrictions of movement as well as the reduction of access of women and men to family planning supplies, there will be at least one pregnancy for every three women with an unmet need for family planning,” said the executive director of Popcom, Juan Antonio Perez III.“These are just some of the adverse impacts of the community quarantine to the welfare of our families, which further aggravates the situation of the ongoing health crisis.”The Philippines has had one of the world\u0027s longest and strictest lockdowns, with President Rodrigo Duterte threatening to “shoot down” any violators. It was the third country to impose restrictions in March, and some areas remain under quarantine now, including the capital, Manila.There have been 36,000 coronavirus cases and around 1,200 deaths. However, the restrictions have had a grave impact on the country\u0027s economy and other services, including its already underfunded health system.  Mr Perez urged all Filipinos to “do their very best” to avoid becoming part of the “staggering” statistics, stressing that helplines and clinics were open and home-delivery supplies of three month-supplies of the contraceptive pill and condoms were available.Popcom expects almost 1.9 million babies to be born in total in the Philippines next year - the highest rate since 2000 - compared to just less than 1.7million in 2018.  “This should sound the alarm for everyone that as the pandemic rages on, family planning should still be top-of-mind for everyone,” Mr Perez said.The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), which, along with the University of the Philippines Population Institute (UPPI), put together the projections, has warned that the global impact on birth rates and women\u0027s health of coronavirus could be “calamitous”.It has predicted that 47 million women across the world in lower and middle-income countries will lose access to contraception, leading to 7 million unplanned pregnancies in the coming months.While some have joked about lockdown leaving couples at home with little else to do, particularly in wealthier countries, the projections for many places also demonstrate rising health inequalities and barriers to access, the risks of school closures for teenage girls, and the impact of the well-documented rise in domestic abuse under lockdown. UNFPA executive director Dr Natalia Kanem said: “The pandemic is deepening inequalities, and millions more women and girls now risk losing the ability to plan their families and protect their bodies and their health.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 29th june 2020","story":"Kevin \u0027Taff\u0027 Stone, Chief Engineer of Vulcan to the Sky, with the aircraft he helps maintain.Boris Johnson plans on a \u0026#39Rooseveltian New Deal\u0026#39 to rebuild BritainCoronavirus latest news: Leicester becomes first British city to have draconian lockdown measures reimposedLeicester put back in lockdown as coronavirus cases riseLeicester lockdown: Police, mayor and business hit out at government\u0026#39s two week closureQuarantine pushes London to bottom of most popular holiday city -

These are the Loveland Foundation, an organisation which describes itself as providing “opportunity and healing to communities of colour … through fellowships, residency programs, listening tours,” as well as the Innocence Project which aims to “free innocent people and transform the legal system” according to its website.The third organisation is the Okra Project, which supports Black Trans people by “bringing home cooked, healthy, and culturally specific meals and resources.”“It is what it is” says it has raised over $65,000 in donations for these projects.While its meaning was obscured, the website gained notoriety for its perculiar URL.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A volunteer workforce of expert scientists, technicians and students were drafted in to help get the Lighthouse Laboratories up and running at the beginning of the UK lockdown. As the first tranche of staff arrived on site in Milton Keynes, the challenge became clear.“The simple fact is the Milton Keynes site wasn’t a lab at all,” said one insider. “Most of the equipment we were using was donated and it all had to be set up quickly. All the tests failed in the beginning.”Another added: “They spent the whole first week getting the process up and running and validating the tests with a hospital checking the work. It would have undoubtedly been a faster response mobilising existing labs.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOne said: “It was 200 unpaid people who knocked out the first 300,000 tests and essentially winging it in a very controlled and sensible way but when you talk about preparedness, that doesn’t strike me as being very prepared.”This article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionSpeaking to The Independent as part of our investigation into the UK’s private coronavirus labs, funded by our Supporter Programme, staff questioned the initial set-up of the three labs, which were opened as part of a centralised push to increase coronavirus testing. Accountancy giant Deloitte managed the operations. The first lab, in Milton Keynes, was opened on 9 April, followed by Alderley Park in Cheshire on 20 April and a third lab in Glasgow a few days later.At the Alderley Park base, nestled on a business park in Cheshire, the feeling was the same: “It was just an office space to begin with, which had to be completely refitted. They started from nothing really.”Local health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19How German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelThe labs received test samples with barcodes, but no other information, then were required to send the test results for each barcode to NHS Digital. The Independent was told the labs did not follow the same standardised processes, meaning there were disagreements on issues such as when to discard damaged or poorly labelled samples, leading to big variations in the void rates between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park.One source said the rates reached as high as 40 per cent and were still at around 20 per cent earlier this month. The Lighthouse Labs and Department of Health said these numbers were not accurate but declined to give an alternative figure.One insider said: “We did have a number of samples that we couldn’t test because the swab had been taken and then it hadn’t been put in the transport tube, which means you can’t test it. Or the sample tube leaked. These are all things that happen when you’re relying on long distance transportation to a testing lab.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“In the early days, we were getting all sorts of combinations of swabs and samples, it was ironed out but that did delay things. You wouldn’t have had to iron out those things if you were using experienced lab staff.”Another described tube errors as the “biggest issue”, adding: “In the early days when we were trying to ramp up to 20,000 it became impossible because the tubes weren’t processable at all. Deloitte have really got on the case with that now.“Everyone has been given the impression these labs were networked and working to a single protocol but that wasn’t the case at all. They were each left to figure it out for themselves.”When the issue of large variations in the void rate between Milton Keynes and Alderley Park emerged, a meeting was held between the labs in May. A source within the labs said: “It was a big issue, with Alderley Park very unhappy. They felt Milton Keynes was trying to make them look bad.”During April, as the virus reached its peak in the country, staff in the labs described setting up the test process and having to overcome problems and errors that many felt were caused because they were starting from scratch.Staff described being moved to tears when they saw the scale of viral infection in care homes.There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrongOne technician said: “One night we thought there was something wrong with the machines. The signals were so strong from the samples from a care home. It was a shocker you could see how strong the virus was. I admit it made some of us quite upset.”When health secretary Matt Hancock triumphantly announced the UK was now carrying out 100,000 tests staff in the labs said they were “hurt and upset” at the obvious use of postal home-test kits to increase the numbers.One scientist said: “People were upset when they announced the target had been met. I felt quite hurt at that, we had achieved so much so just to lie about it sort of devalued it a lot. A lot of us were p***ed off. We had done brilliantly to get to 65-70,000 tests at that stage.”As many staff begin to return to their normal lives, some told The Independent they had been unaware private companies were behind the labs and felt “exploited” as the labs now looked to recruit paid staff and expand further.“I didn’t really realise there was profit to be made, perhaps I was naive,” said one volunteer who has since returned to their university: “The way things are changing at the labs now, it does make a lot of sense that they’re private companies.They added: “I think they’ve really underappreciated how fragile the processes are. It’s all very well getting these guys in without the experience. And it’s fine when it’s running smoothly but it’s when it goes wrong. There were several occasions where it all went really badly wrong, and we stood the risk of losing thousands of tests.”The Milton Keynes Lighthouse Lab was based at UK Biocentre, a not-for-profit company set up to do academic biomedical research. It employed only 27 staff before the crisis and had no experience of providing infectious disease testing, with one source saying: “It was a very odd choice to create a lab there from nothing.”The company was established in 2011 as a subsidiary of the UK Biobank charity and is funded by the taxpayers via the National Institute for Health Research and the Department of Health, which has gave the company a grant of £653,000 in 2017 after it made a loss. Its latest accounts for the year to September 2018 show it made a loss of more than £11,000 and reported it expected to continue making losses until it could expand services at the site.The Cheshire Lighthouse Lab is run by Medicines Discovery Catapult, described as a technology and medical innovation incubator funded by Innovate UK, an agency of the UK government. It also had little experience in running large-scale infectious disease testing.Along with the third site in Glasgow, these labs have been operating without formal accreditation to confirm they meet the same standards followed by most UK laboratories.Allan Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Science, said: “When you set Lighthouse Labs up, running only with volunteers without registered staff, which are largely unaccredited, then I think that runs significant risks and that’s not a risk many other countries are prepared to take.“The testing strategy for this country has been constantly shifting with more political targets than clinical. Before May there was no clear testing strategy. We should be using testing in a targeted way to try and reduce the transmission of disease.”Medicines Discovery Catapult said the integrity of samples and packaging received by the labs varied and any samples deemed unsafe or which could not be identified were classed as void and not tested. It said efforts were ongoing to improve the packaging across testing sites.MDC said the labs had been working under an open book not-for-profit contract with the Department of Health, and all volunteers have been offered salaries with many taking on the roles.It said the success of the labs meant there was now a need to maintain them, which is why they were now recruiting for longer term staff.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersHow German coronavirus testing stormed ahead of the UK’s modelLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusThis article was funded by our supporters.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As the UK barely managed 5,000 coronavirus tests a day in early March, Germany was already nearing 100,000 tests per week – significantly ramping up testing with the virus raging in nearby Italy.While Britain had stopped most testing of the virus and entered into lockdown, Berlin took a different path, mobilising its network of laboratories and involving dozens of private labs and companies in what was seen as a national effort.In our investigation into Britain’s efforts to rapidly expand testing, funded by The Independent\u0027s Supporter Programme, multiple sources referenced the German approach as an example of what the UK could have done had decisions been taken earlier. Though the German diagnostics industry is better established than the UK’s, they also pointed to a fundamentally different approach for expansion and conveying results.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis article was funded by our supporters. If you would like to see more of this important work, please make a contributionTom Lewis, national lead for pathology in the NHS Getting It Right First Time programme, said: “If you look at Germany in particular, here is an integrated public health response with testing at the core of that but it’s testing with a purpose. They had a much smaller problem than we did.”Colin Fink, from Micropathology Ltd, said: “Germany is very interesting. There is no public-private ide in the sense that there’s no Victorian prejudice against trade like there is in the UK. They are controlled price-wise, by the government and their competition is really their turnaround time, and their portfolio of organisms.Inside the coronavirus mega-labsLocal health officials say they’ve been left in the dark on Covid-19“They instantly geared up when they saw this coming and so they had a much better infrastructure to be able to address the problem.”When the first cases emerged in Germany in February many of the existing private labs in the country recognised the threat and began to work on increasing testing.Daniel Hefel, from Medicover Diagnostic Services and a member of Germany’s Association of Certified Labs, or ALM, told The Independent: “We started very early to bring together all the competition, usually the laboratories were never talking to each other, but we decided very early in the Covid-19 crisis that we needed to share information.“The most important thing was speed and to scale up very, very quickly so that we can deliver results the same day or one day later.”He said that by the first week of March the country was delivering just under 100,000 tests a week but this rapidly increased and is now in the region of 350,000 tests a week after 10 weeks with the capacity to do much more if needed.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In these two hours we informed the health authority, the health authority went to the media, but in parallel they contacted the patient and started immediate isolation. This was in the beginning of March.The biggest challenge is when you have a huge centralised lab, and you want to funnel everything into the central lab, and that was also what the US did in the beginning where they had a couple of monster labs set up, but it was not covering the whole state so they opened up to many other labs in the US and then scaling is much easier.”Asked about the UK approach he said: “Building up something from scratch is certainly very difficult. I would have it done differently.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The Lighthouse Labs form part of the biggest network of diagnostic laboratories in British history and has been set up in a matter of months.“The UK has one of the largest testing programmes in the world and it draws on the expertise and resources of a number of public and private sector partners which has undoubtedly curbed the spread of the virus and saved lives.”Read the rest of our Failing the Test investigation:Slow start and flawed decisions in Britain’s coronavirus testing have cost lives, warn health leadersLocal health officials say they have been left in the dark on spread of coronavirusInside the coronavirus mega-labsThis article was funded by our supporters.

The lost item posed no risk to the astronauts, spacewalk or the station, Nasa said.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerSpacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Cassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.From fashion stylist to farm hand: meet the people helping to harvestThe bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms. Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project,’ one helper saysWhat has it been like to volunteer during the pandemic? Social enterprise Bread n Butter – one of the charities supplied by our Help The Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project – closed its doors at the end of March.However, its founders saw a growing need among the city’s most vulnerable for regular home-cooked, nutritious meals, so they joined with community centres Stonegrove Community Trust and the Hive Trust.Since then, Bread n Butter’s team, aided by volunteers, have been cooking and delivering more than 1,000 meals a day to Londoners in need in Barnet, Enfield and Brent. Here, we speak to four people who keep this project going.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRichard Simon, a furloughed IT worker, joined the Stonegrove Community Trust’s OneStonegrove project in Edgware at his wife’s suggestion. The 52-year-old said: “Working in the kitchens was like being on Ready Steady Cook. You don’t know what ingredients you’re going to be working with, so you have to think on your feet.” The father of two, who dedicates 20 hours a week, added that the biggest thing he had learnt was the power of “working together”.“For a group of people who don’t know each other, we just get on with it, working flat out.

It has been extraordinary.”How to support our campaignBid on Sir Peter Blake’s artwork in Help the Hungry auction, say stars4.3 million meals to be delivered as Help The Hungry appeal passes £7mJoanne Karbritz, 47, works up to five hours a day, four days a week at OneStonegrove community centre. The former Oxfam shop worker, who has high-functioning autism, said that because of her condition, having a “structured day” is incredibly important. “Without routine, I can’t cope,” she said. “I would not be here if it wasn’t for this project.”Ms Karbritz, who is also anorexic, said working with food had been transformative. “Working to create healthy, nutritious food everyday has changed my relationship with it. I have also learned how to cook, whereas before I lived out of tins.”Mariana Bassi Da Silva, a software developer, wanted to volunteer as she was not working due to the pandemic. A keen cook, the 34-year-old volunteered for OneStonegrove and said the project had helped develop her love of cooking. The Brazilian-Italian, who moved to London seven years ago, said the greatest impact the project has had on her was the sense of “belonging”.“It is hard to settle in when you move,” she said. “Here, I have a community.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.How schools in England are helping pupils return to the classroomThe task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Hancock also said the further easing of the lockdown planned for the rest of England on July 4 will not now happen in Leicester.

He advised people in  Leicester to stay at home as much as possible while the local lockdown continues.“Difficult but important decisions” had been taken, he said.We recommend to people in Leicester, stay at home as much as you can, and we recommend against all but essential travel to, from and within Leicester.We\u0027ll monitor closely adhering to social distancing rules and we\u0027ll take further steps if that is what\u0027s necessary.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised the government, saying  Leicester needed clarity about the lockdown and not briefings from over-eager advisers.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSchools could also be warned that they may have to concentrate on allowing pupils to catch up in subjects like maths and English after lockdown, and a full curriculum may not be available until next year’s summer term.Some pupils could also have to drop some GSCE subjects altogether to allow them to achieve better grades in “core subjects”.The guidance is expected to be set out by Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, later this week. Mr Williamson is under intense pressure to have all children in England back in school by September, after the government was forced to U-turn on plans to have them in the classroom before the end of the summer term. The proposals were first reported by the HuffPost website. It is thought schools will also be told they have to continue to engage with the NHS Test and Trace system, and that whole classes or year groups could be sent home if a pupil tests positive for Covid-19. Ministers are understood to believe that parents have got used to the idea of smaller “bubbles” in schools and that the idea can be scaled up to help all pupils return to school in September.  Around 1.5 million pupils are currently in school, after ministers announced that some year groups could return.

Teachers would also be advised to remain 2 metres away from pupils, not spend more than 15 minutes with each pupil,  but not wear face coverings, because they interfere with teaching. The site also reported that children would be told to face the same direction, not sit at circular tables. At the weekend Boris Johnson confirmed he wanted it to be compulsory again from September to send children to school. Many parents have so far decided not to send their kids to school, amid fears over the spread of the disease.It is understood the proposals seen by HuffPost were a form of draft. The final guidance will be released later this week, sources said. Experts warn that many children are falling behind after weeks out of the classroom. There are also concerns about how the economy will cope if parents continue to have to juggle their day job with full time care of children. Mr Williamson told LBC that fines were one option for parents whose children do not return to school.“Unless there is a good reason for the absence then we will be looking at the fact that we would be imposing fines on families if they are not sending their children back,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Prior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

At least three counties including Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach plan on closing-down beaches and parks from Friday 3 July to prevent overcrowding as coronavirus cases continue to spike.  In a statement, Miami-Dade County mayor Carols Gimenez condemned those who were not adhering to measures on social-distancing and mask-wearing and appealed to “common sense”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe mayor also warned that Miami’s beaches and parks could continue to be closed-down.  “As we continue to see more Covid-19 positive test results among young adults and rising hospitalisations, I have decided that the only prudent thing to do to tamp down this recent uptick is to crack down on recreational activities that put our overall community at higher risk,” said Mr Gimenez.Florida bans alcohol in bars as coronavirus case numbers spikeFlorida breaks virus record confirming almost 9,000 cases in one dayAlmost half of US states report increasing Covid-19 infectionsFlorida health care worker and 15 friends get Covid-19 by going to barFlorida, Texas and Arizona see highest single-day Covid-19 cases He added that “this new order will be targeting those who are being most irresponsible and endangering our community’s health and our economic recovery.” All beaches and parks in Miami-Dade County will close between Friday 3 July and Tuesday 7 July, whilst gatherings and parades with more than 50 persons are prohibited. At the same time, beaches in Fort Lauderdale and Broward County will be closed between Friday 3 July and Sunday 5 July, said mayor Dean Trantalis on Sunday.“The reason why we’re doing this is because we feel that we will not be able to provide the necessary safe environment that everyone is entitled to enjoy when they come to our beaches,” said Mr Trantalis.“Our businesses will remain open -- all the restaurants, all the T-shirt shops, all the retail shops -- everything will be open,” he continued. “But, unfortunately, because we normally anticipate large crowds, perhaps even coming from other counties, that we made this decision to move forward.”Still, crowds lambasted Broward County authorities who made that announcement, with some shouting slogans such as “Freedom” and “This is America”, said CNN.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The virus poses a greater threat to my elderly mum than it does to me.Men from working-class backgrounds are more likely to die, as are people from ethnic-minority communities.Coronavirus doesn’t just discriminate when it comes to health. It discriminates according to wealth, too.As we live through the worst economic crisis of our time, some parts of the country will be hit a lot harder than others.The impact the virus has had on our economy is breathtaking. The Bank of England says \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"we are heading for the biggest recession in  years.The fall in output in March and April alone wiped out  years of growth. Claims for Universal Credit have already risen by .million.Behind these statistics are the jobs and livelihoods of hard-working people.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"Whether this has affected you personally depends on your line of work.Advertising executives, accountants and lawyers are able to work from home.Those with jobs in manufacturing, construction and retail are not.The more labour-intensive an industry is, the harder it is likely to have been hit by lockdown.The types of jobs that are most cushioned from the economic crisis are concentrated in London and the South East.Manufacturing jobs are mostly found in Yorkshire and the North. The West Midlands — where I’m an MP — will take a harder hit than London because much of our local economy relies on car manufacturing.Of course, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"inequalities between these areas already existed.Before the virus, wages were  per cent lower in the North East than they were in London and le expectancy was nearly three years shorter.Fixing that was a driving force behind our General Election victory six months ago. My concern is that the crisis could make an unfair situation even worse.It’s not just a question of fairness, either. Across the country, towns and cities continue to underperform due to a lack of investment.Putting an end to this tragic waste of potential is a crucial part of boosting the nation’s productivity.The Prime Minister gets all this. That’s why \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"he is gearing up to kick-start growth with a massive package of investment. As he looks to rebuild, he will rightly see this as an opportunity not only to revive our economy, but to set it on a firmer, fairer foundation than before.I’ve been working with the Centre for Policy Studies since we went into lockdown, coming up with ideas to help my colleagues in government secure the strongest possible recovery as we come out of it.I want to make sure that left-behind regions not only share in our economic comeback, but that our plan is specically designed to spread prosperity to every corner of the country, leaving no one behind.Thankfully, we’re not short on options.One of the first things we can do is bring forward plans for a revolution in regional infrastructure.Investing in roads, railways and broadband will increase economic activity and boost communities by creating new jobs and helping businesses grow.Alongside investment in training and skills, this will transform the regions.The Government should also take advantage of record-low rates to massively step up the amount of cash it is willing to invest in overlooked areas.Where this cash goes shouldn’t be led by bureaucrats in Whitehall, but local people who really understand the problems in their area.City and Town Deals have proved a huge success, as have visionaryMayors such as Ben Houchen in Tees Valley and Andy Street in the West Midlands.We shouldn’t be afraid to devolve wider and deeper across England, increasing the powers of local authorities and setting up models that have proved successful.Finally, we need to find new ways of putting money back in people’s pockets, and change the tax system where it is grossly unfair. For towns and cities across the North, we can do both by changing the way council tax works.Bizarrely, your council tax is calculated using property values that are  years out of date.If you move into a new-build, the valuation office tells you what band you’re in based on a guess of what it might have been worth in .Because the value of their homes has soared since then, this system effectively hands rich homeowners a massive discount.That isn’t fair. We should consider a full council tax revaluation to make sure that hardworking people in less well-off areas are not subsidising the rest of the country.This pandemic will change many things about our country.

One was father of nine cygnets nearby and one was from a pair who were being territorial.They had been sparring for some time before crowds gathered and had sparred several times in previous days without a fight actually breaking out. The girl was trying to separate the swans to avoid one of them being killed.The one to pursue is the idiot boy in the blue shirt who pushed the man in the canal.A second witness also backed the girl - claiming it was an attempt to break up an attack rather than her baiting the animals.And another claimed a woman had been screaming at the swans to stop before the girl kicked out to try to stop the clash.The bystander said the man who confronted her was telling her not to disturb nature when he was attacked by the group.They added: This father male swan went after the other couple swan. And he tried to murder the other male swan by using his mouth and neck to wrestle the other swan’s neck into the water trying to drown him.

In the first half of the   academic year the number of starts had dropped  per cent for those aged  to .Mr Johnson set out his hopes for apprenticeships in a letter to Commons Liaison Committee head Sir Bernard Jenkin.He wrote: “We will develop new measures to grow the economy and to boost skills. “For apprenticeships, we are looking at how we can support employers, especially small businesses, to take on new apprentices this year.“We will also ensure that there is sufficient funding.”Mr Johnson is expected to expand on his plans tomorrow.Mr Sunak is likely to outline the Government’s jobs recovery strategy next week.Commons Education committee chairman Robert Halfon will tomorrow set out proposals he believes that ministers could implement to encourage firms to hire apprentices.His scheme, similar to that being considered by Mr Sunak, calls for the Government’s £billion National Skills Fund to cover training costs and the first year’s salary for small and medium-sized businesses that take on young apprentices.But he also wants an overhaul of the existing Apprenticeship Levy, a tax on employers to fund training.Mr Halfon says employers should be allowed to access the levy to fully fund training of a younger apprentice or someone from a disadvantaged background — but only partly fund an older apprentice.Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Gillian Keegan said yesterday: “Apprenticeships are an excellent way to get into a wide range of rewarding and valuable careers.“We will ensure there is sufficient funding this year to support smaller businesses wanting to take on an apprentice.”BRITAIN has never taken apprenticeships seriously.And the country has suffered as a result on two counts.For years, universities offering third rate courses have shamelessly swindled young people who have few other options.And without proper training, Brits haven’t had the skills to fill vital jobs.ButRishi Sunak pushes ahead with his eminently sensible plan to hand a £, bounty to employers who take on apprentices, he could change all that.Yes, it would be expensive.But a cash injection could do wonders for British businesses desperately trying to get back on their feet.And surely it would be a better use of taxpayers’ money than forking out billions in universal credit to healthy young people able and eager to work GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission from aerosol and droplets.  But many couples may have to wait until September to tie the knot because some councils are delaying ceremonies until the autumn to give venues time to adjust to social distancing requirements.County councils that oversee registrar services told the Dailythat they could have to wait even longer than September.Oxford county council said it would only begin a phased approach to reopening wedding venues from September .And Somerset county council have demanded all venues fill out a risk assessment before any bookings take place - delaying weddings in the country for weeks at least.  Meanwhile, places of worship will be able to hold services for more than  people, but social distancing guidelines should be adhered to.Hymn books should be quarantined for  hours after use, while worshippers will be advised to take their own religious texts or prayer mats.Donations should be collected via contactless devices or online, where possible, or cash should be placed in a receptacle that is set in one place and not passed around.Where food and drink is essential to the act of worship, it will be permitted, but the sharing of food should be avoided - as well as the use of communal vessels.Those giving and receiving food should wash their hands before and after consumption, or wear gloves, according to the guidance.Singing, chanting, shouting and the playing of wind instruments should also be avoided because of the potential for increased risk of Covid- transmission from aerosol and droplets.Organs can be played for faith practices, but music should be at a volume that does not require worshippers to raise their voices.Lecycle events such as baptisms and bar mitzvahs should also have no more than  people present, unless the event is part of a routine communal worship service.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We’re fully booked and they’ve just dropped us right in it.“We’d taken the precautions with PPE and planned training for the staff, we were even doing our own track and tracing, we’ve sterilised everything - it’s cost a fortune.“I’ve been following the rules but I’m opening on July  regardless. I’ve told all my clients.“If they want to arrest all the hairdressers in Leicester they’ll have some prisoners with great hair.”Alex Hylton, , licensee of the Salmon Pub, said: “I’m absolutely gutted about lockdown potentially being extended.“If we have to stay shut to help the city recover, I completely respect that. But I can’t see there will be any support from the local or national government.“This year would’ve been a great year for the pub with the Euros, Leicester in the Champions League and a massive Kasabian gig down the road. We would have sold loads of beer over the summer.”Meanwhile a local politician has said language barriers among the citys large Asian community have been cited as one possible factor behind the spike.City councillor Ratilal Govind told MailOnline that he thought there had been a lack of communication with people who do not speak English as a first language in the city.Councillor Govind, who represents the city’s Evington ward where one of the four mobile testing stations for the virus has been sited, said: ‘I have seen young people getting together, having a few drinks and conversation.“They are just social gatherings. With these young people there is a language barrier. They are speaking their own language and I tell them to disperse in Gujarati.“There is a lack of communication made worse by the language barriers.”Speaking of the surge in new cases on a visit to a construction site in west London this morning, the Prime Minister said: We are concerned about Leicester, we are concerned about any local outbreak.I want to stress to people that we are not out of the woods yet. We are making these cautious, calibrated steps, we are opening as much of hospitality as we can on July , opening as much of the economy as we can - some things, alas, still remain closed until they can become Covid-secure.The UKs coronavirus death toll has risen to , after  more deaths were confirmed today.He added that the local whack-a-mole strategy had worked in Weston-super-Mare and where there had been outbreaks around GP surgeries in London.Thats the same approach that we will bring to bear in Leicester as well.  The PMs comments come after the Government was warned this week that imposing local lockdowns could lead to signicant disorder.But some MPs, including Labour MP for Leicester East, Claudia Webbe, believe they may be necessary.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Ms Webbe said this morning: I’m very concerned, and I really do believe that where the data allows we need to ensure that we engage in processes to protect lives, and I think we need to go into therefore more localised lockdown to protect lives and ensure that we can address this virus.“The Government hasn’t reassured us. Thus far, the messages and the communication from the Government have been unclear, and it has been dficult, and I really don’t understand what communities are meant to follow.”Sir Peter Soulsby said he will need to be convinced into keeping pubs and restaurants shut in Leicester - as a fresh spike in coronavirus cases blasts the area.He was left furious this morning after Public Health Englandsent him a report of the situation overnight.According to Sir Peter, the reports recommendations are about extending the restrictions for a further two weeks, but what we still dont have - whether its lockdown or restrictions - is why on earth you would do it and why you would do it here in Leicester.The fuming mayor said the report had been cobbled together and readily acknowledges that cases are higher in Leicester due to higher levels of testing in the city.He told the BBC: Ive looked at this report and, frankly, its obviously been cobbled together very hastily.Its superficial and its description of Leicester is inaccurate and certainly it does not provide us with the information we needwe are to remain restricted for two weeks longer than the rest of the country.The Department of Health and Social Care acknowledged the city was an area of concern as it urged residents to be vigilant against the virus.Anyone with symptoms should get a test as soon as possible, they stressed.Home Secretary Priti Patel confirmed the area could face a local lockdown yesterday.When asked about the potential plans by Andrew Marr on the BBC, she said: That is correct.We have seen flare-ups across the country already, just in the last three or four weeks in particular.“There will be support going into Leicester.  Earlier this month Sage documents revealed that local lockdowns could see violence and social unrest erupt.In papers released at the end of May, the Security sub-group, which feeds into the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswarned that imposing local lockdowns would not be suitable for implementation in the UK.Experts from Keele University warned it could undermine the consensus that has been built on the need for restrictive measures and lead to signicant issues of disorder.They added: The measures as proposed would entail the use of state power in an unprecedented way that could be perceived as discriminatory. A consensus has evolved in the UK over the last weeks concerning the need for restrictive measures which suggests that support for restrictive measures is contingent upon a sense of equality of sacrice . The proposed scheme undermines this core proposition.They added: Anger arising from communities who perceived they have been locked down unfairly would be directed at police in the majority of cases.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s not the case.And make no mistake the prime minister’s shake-up at Westminster is good news.The chances of a post-Brexit economic revolution have now greatly improved.Michael Gove was exactly right in his major speech over the weekend where he challenged “group think” from the “metropolitan” elite in the civil service who have become “estranged” from ordinary folk.Nowhere was that more clear than the way the civil service tried every step of the way to stop Brexit happening at all. If Theresa May had stayed PM, they probably would have succeeded.As the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster put it, every arm of government seemed estranged from the majority”.We can’t forget that.Referring to the nd US President Franklin D.

I cant understand how mothers and fathers leave their children at home with some caregivers.Pictures show the man holding the girl firmly on his shoulders, before Zoran convinces him to take the child back to the playground.As they were walking back towards the playground, Zoran asked the suspect: Why did you take the child with you The suspected kidnapper said: “I think children are simply the most important thing. Children are our future, arent they ”When they arrived at the playground in the park, he asked the girl on his shoulders: Is your mum here in the park He added: All right, thats where were going, right  Were going to mum, right  You sit up there. You have to look for where she is. You have the best view, OK  Wheres mum  Oh, damn, a lot of people.

They found that there was no evidence that he was a paedophile.They determined that the suspect had a permanent residence, that there was no risk of escape and that he had a mental disorder.The police, trying to reassure worried parents on Twitter, said: So far there is no evidence of a sexual motivation or of malicious intent. Visiting a playground in Berlin is no more dangerous than usual.Heike S was quoted in local media as saying: I imagined what would it have been likeit had been my child.

I will be making no apology.    I did the right thing and would do it againneeds be. He branded Broadstairs racism on sea in his blog post and revealed he expected to be contacted by police.Writing on his blog, the brazen former local politician for Thanet said: “Just in case you hadnt already guessed, I was responsible for the spate of graffiti in Broadstairs and Ramsgate.”He was inspired by Broadstairs Town Council’s decision to retain the Uncle Mack memorial and Thanet Council’s review of its publicly funded racist properties and activities.The museum represents historic racism and therefore deserves to be tarnished, he alleged.Mr Driver went on: “I selected the targets as they represent the deep-rooted institutional racism of Broadstairs Town and Thanet District councils.“Broadstairs Dickens Week and Folk Week charities openly support, celebrate, and fund with public money, offensive blacked up Morris dancers, Uncle Mack’s blacked up Minstrel show memorial, and genocidal racists such as Charles Dickens and King Leopold of Belgium.”The vandal revealed that the council’s lack of interest in his personal protest has led him to graffiti.Driver continued: “I have been campaigning against, what I believe to be, the institutional racism of the Broadstairs and Dickens and Folk week events and the Broadstairs and Thanet councils for several years but to no avail.“I have now been forced, by the inaction, of these organisations to take direct measures to expose the appalling racism of our local government and some of our major charities who are being funded by the councils.“Although I live here and love the place, in my opinion Broadstairs richly deserves the epithet Racism-on-Sea.“My actions are nothing to do with the Black Lives Matter movement, of which I am a supporter, and are purely part of my own inidual protest for which I alone am responsible.”The toppling of the statue of slave owner Edward Colston in Bristol inspired Driver - and he maintains that defacing memorials is a legitimate part of protest.“I fully support and encourage this form of political expression wherever and whenever it is necessary, especially in my hometown which, to its shame, is rapidly becoming known as Racism-On-Sea”, he added.Kent Police have been contacted for comment.The Dickens House Museum in Broadstairs, Kent, was the inspiration for Betsey Trotwood’s home in David Copperfield, and Dickens is known to have visited regularly.Shocked locals noticed Dickens Racist, Dickens Racist was left in black ink this weekend on the property’s front wall, while a road signed had been painted over.Judith Carr said: “What madness! Aside from the fact that it is illegal to deface private property, Dickens spent his le pointing out the evils of social injustices of all kinds.”Phil Harradence said: “Please tell me the uneducated, knuckle dragging moron responsible for this have been caught on CCTV “Have we now lost complete control of sense in this country, absolutely disgusting behaviour.

A lot of historical figures actually had views of ‘primitive’ cultures.“Im not saying he was a full blown kkk racist, but instead of jumping on this as mindless, do a bit of research and consider why this was put there.”The property, named ‘Dickens House’ before the end of the th century, was bought by the Tattam family in .In  it was gted to the town by Dora Tattam and opened as a museum according to the terms of her will.The character Betsey Trotwood is based on Miss Mary Pearson Strong who lived in the cottage that is now the museum.According to Charles Dickens’ son Charley, he and his father regularly had tea and cakes in the parlour with Miss Pearson Strong.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Itaposs a good school. The teaching is great, and sheaposll love it. I still wish she was going to eat lunch in a room where the walls joined up in the conventional fashion, and everyone could be certain the weather wouldnapost become a condiment. So the announcement, trailed in the Sunday papers and made today by Boris Johnson, of £bn for a national school building project, is of particular interest. Mostly, because it shows that for £, a year Eton taught him no maths whatsoever.All children deserve the best possible start in le, he said. Itaposs important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.Except the £bn is over  years, and for  projects. So thataposs  schools a year, at £m each, even though in  a new primary cost around £m.Between  and , the Tories opened  aposfree schoolsapos, costing £.bn. So that was  schools a year, at an average of £.m each. A much better rate ofthan we are now offered, even though around £m of it went on lawyers.Between  and , the Building Schools for the Future programme rebuilt or refurbished  schools. It was going to invest £bn over  years and rebuild every secondary in the country. Its flaws - a lack of big-project expertise in local councils, PFI fees, and the fact it was a Labour idea - meant the Tories cancelled it. BSF was the biggest school building programme since the Victorian one, which had put a primary school in almost every town and village in the country. Have you spotted the pattern  We have spent an ever-decreasing proportion of our cash on schools, for more than a century.Last year it was revealed weaposll need , new classrooms for a .% increase in primary pupils by . For Johnsonaposs plan to meet that demand, the first  schools he promises next year would need to have , classrooms - each.The National Audit Office says our , primary, middle and secondary state schools need a total of £.bn of repairs - just repairs - but the PM has offered them £m for crumbling buildings. Thataposs % of whataposs needed, or £, per school. With an average primary school refurbishment cost of £, per square metre, that would pay for .sq metres. Or about half a classroom.BSF built schools, slowly, in areas where they were wanted. Free schools has put them, quicker, where they are not needed. A report by the Education Policy Institute last year found far fewer of them being opened in hampered areas. And during lockdown, it is children in those places which have suffered most, had least access to the technology needed to keep up, and now need the most help. To recap, class: the PM has promised £bn over  years for  schools which will be the most expensive, and biggest, ever built.

But the National Residential Landlords Association said some cases that were not linked to coronavirus should resume now. Policy director Chris Norris told the Commons Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee landlords were in judicial limbo and eviction courts will see a backlog. Askedit should be extended beyond August , he replied: We donapost think it should be extended. “In fact I think at the moment there are certain cases that we could be getting some of the case management dealt with now. “So when weaposve got those cases that have got absolutely nothing to do with the Covid crisis - those cases where in many many instances a possession order was actually granted prior to lockdown - we donapost see any reason why we couldnapost start opening up the system so they could be progressed now as lockdown is being lted. “We certainly don’t see any need for a continuation of this blanket ban on possessions that we see that the moment.” It came as charities and campaigners urged the government to put in a long-term plan to deal with a financial crisis to come.  Caitlin Wilkinson of Generation Rent told MPs “we need to see some additional protections” - otherwise “huge numbers of tenants will be unable to pay their rent and will lose their home as a result”. Ruth Ehrlich, Policy Officer at Shelter, estimated between % and % of renters have accrued arrears during the crisis - up from around % normally. She claimed more than a million people could now be in arrears - which would increase as the furlough scheme ends and more paychecks are missed. Ms Ehrlich warned: “, renters have been told by their landlord that they are going to be evicted in the coming months.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad describes post lockdown reality","story":"NewsDad who went to Chessington Zoo after it reopened says its just not worth itMatt Strudwick had been looking forward to a family day out and a change of scenery from the two mile beaten track around his house he had worn out since March  - but the experience wasnt quite what hed imaginedShareByMatt Strudwick:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video zoo-days-chessington-world-adventures-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news dad-describes-post-lockdown-reality-\"\", url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But after his trip to Chessington Zoo he said it is safe to say that post-lockdown zoo days at the theme park belong like its animals on the day - firmly in the shade. The unenviable depressing milestone of  days of being in lockdown was fast approaching for Matt and the screams for some sense of normality were getting louder. When Chessington announced it would be reopening its zoo, an audible gasp rumbled throughout his home. But Surrey Liveaposs content editor Matt has described his experience in an opinion piece...  The mundane trudge of a daily . hour sht of sitting on a wooden chair, with my back creaking, at my dining room table, where the memory of weekends had evaporated, would at last be broken. We could finally have a family day out. The relief I felt was more for my -month-old son, as I am sure he was becoming increasingly puzzled as to why his father was spending more time looking at a rectangular bright screen than playing with him. No sooner than it was announced had we swtly, and quite easily, booked our tickets through the website. The empty calendar and crossed out planned events ruined by the coronavirus pandemic finally had a new entry June  - Chessington. The day out The day had finally arrived. A Wednesday, but by now Wednesday meant as much to me as any other day. It didnapost matter, and the sunaposs blistering heat, which was causing the mercury to edge towards C, only added to our enthusiasm. With the theme park just a  minute drive from our house in Dorking, we decided it was best to head out in the afternoon after our toddler had had his nap and had a full stomach. Our entry into Chessington felt like any other time we had gone - until the barrier lted. Cones taped together direct you, and red signs with bold white letters tell you to remain in your car where you will be temperature checked before being allowed to enter a car park.  All seemed clear and simple, but that was as much clarity we were greeted with throughout our day and the waters would become murkier with each added confusion. If youaposre missing the thrill of the rides, then the journey to the car park takes on its own epic route, though itaposs lacking in any exhilaration. We passed two unmanned empty tents and muttered to each other that surely this is where the temperature checks are supposed to take place  With no-one in sight we continued our circuitous drive before alarmingly ending up at the exit barrier. A security guard came to our aid and they seemed more in shock that we were arriving at pm rather than how we had become lost.  We were kindly ushered into a near barren car park, with just a littering of cars cowering in the shade, used by Merlin annual passholders. The bumpy start to our family trip was not going to dampen our suncreamed bodies, and we excitedly made our way up to the entry gates where the promised temperature checks were painlessly conducted by a PPE-kitted staff member. Bag checks done, we entered the eerily quiet theme park, but with the added plus that there were no queues. We were handed a leaflet explaining what was open, and informed of one eatery offering food that wasnapost listed, as well as some handy safety tips as you make your way around the apparent one-way system. One thing is for sure, you canapost walk five metres without being met by a hand sanitiser dispenser, and signs telling you to clean your paws and to keep two metres apart.  A day that promised so much but delivered as much entertainment as the Star Wars prequel trilogyapos The one-way system starts in Wanyama Village, and unless youaposre equipped with an inbuilt GPS or are a frequent visitor of the park, finding it is an added frustration. After we walked through the Rainforest where the promise of tortoises was unfulfilled, we had to ask a friendly staff member to point us in the right direction. It was here, too, where the unlisted food outlet was supposed to be bustling. Instead, the shutters were pulled down with only the sad existence of a lonely barrier strap as evidence that it had been open. We hastily found the Wanyama Village and were guided by painted yellow arrows on the floor, and passed numerous hand sanitiser dispensers and one-way system signs - as, confusingly, some families walked the other way. It was only when we reached the enclosure where we were greeted by the magnicent sight of giraffes, zebras, and ostriches meandering in the field that we understood why people were walking against the one-way system, as there was an exit only sign directing to where we had just come from.  The two metre social distancing guidelines were also impossible to adhere to as you made your way up the ramp to overlook the vast enclosure, as, as expected, this is where most people were congregating. After much pointing and with our anxiety levels heightened having come in close contact with other humans, we descended before continuing on the one way route. Meerkats, Ankole Cattle, Bolivian Squirrel Monkeys, Sea Lions, and of course the Humboldt Penguins easily became the highlight, but it was to the Trail of the Kings and the anticipation of seeing the Asiatic Lions and Western Lowland Gorillas that topped our list. Not for the first time, locating it was another matter. Having sought the guidance from another helpful staff member, we made our way to our highlighted destination where it was prewarned that limited capacity was in operation. There was no need to worry about the number of people, as pretty much like the visible guidance, it was minimal. Indeed, one employee told us the area had a capacity for  but at one point it only had eight people. Any hopes our trip would suddenly springboard onto an upward trajectory were dashed in an instant, as we walked the past the squeaky clean windows with only vegetation to look at. No doubt the hot weather had caused the wild animals to shy away, although we did see a lonely gorilla scratching his head."},{"url":null,"title":"grandmothers 200 argos garden table","story":"NewsGrandmothers £ Argos garden table explodes due to extreme C heatThe Argos Home Sicily six seater that shattered into pieces into the Liverpool grans garden during the heatwave had previously been the focus of complaintsShareCommentsByJohn Glover:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video argos-garden-table-explodes-due-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news grandmothers--argos-garden-table-\"\", url\"News, views and top stories .

The food processing site, which employs more than , people, has seen an outbreak weeks after staff walked out over concerns about coronavirus working conditions. Public Health Wales said they are working to contact around  workers who have not been tested for Covid-. In a statement, PHW said: We are working with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to urgently contact just over  workers that have not yet presented for testing. As we would expect with any focused track and trace process, we will identy additional asymptomatic cases. Finding these cases does not mean that the rate of infection in the Wrexham area is increasing as a whole. There is no evidence that Rowan Foods is the source of the outbreak. The multi-agency team managing the outbreak with Public Health Wales will continue to review the situation and work with the employer, their workforce and wider community to bring this outbreak to a swt conclusion. A spokesperson for Rowan Foods said: Last week the Rowan Foods site in Wrexham welcomed the Health and Safety Executiveonto site to conduct a two-day visit specically around COVID- practices.This was an in-depth review of our risk assessment and measures implemented to protect our people, and our ongoing management of COVID- on site. The visit went well and the HSE Inspector left site on Friday  June with no enforceable action taken.  This confirms that we have no serious issues which need addressing and we continue to comply with the law. As a site we were very pleased to receive assurance that the considerable measures we put in place in early March  to protect our workforce had been successful and were protecting our colleagues from Covid-.  Everyone on site between  and  June actively participated in the testing process. We are aware that Public Health Wales has said that it is trying to trace  missing employees. We are extremely puzzled by this as we provided the Public Health Wales testing unit with a list of nearly  colleagues who were not on site for reasons such as shielding, maternity leave, long term sick and isolation. Separately, unfortunately following the testing process, we have a high number of colleagues who are awaiting test results.  We understand Public Health Wales has a discrepancy of  tests which they are still trying to find within their testing process. :We are actively pursuing Public Health Wales for the outstanding results so that our colleagues get the appropriate reassurance.: There has also been  confirmed cases at the  Sisters plant at Llangefni -  which is closed - after more than  people were tested. Speaking about this outbreak, Public Health Wales said: Following the multi-agency Outbreak Control Team meeting which took place on Friday  June, a total of  cases of Novel Coronavirus have been identied in the workforce associated with the  Sisters plant in Llangefni, Anglesey.  This represents a small increase of six positive cases reported in the past -hour period.

It could face another two weeks in lockdown in a bid to control an outbreak of  coronavirus, it has been suggested. But it is not the only area experiencing a rise in cases, as a tally shows dozens of areas are still seeing more cases even as the spread of Covid- slows. New confirmed cases have been rising across  of the  upper-tier local authorities in England in recent weeks as the country moves through its lockdown phases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to give an update to the Commons this evening after talks with Leicesteraposs leaders. Officials have suggested keeping in place current lockdown restrictions in the city - which are due to be lted across the country on July  - in order to stamp out the local outbreak. The country is bracing for pubs, hotels and places of worship and businesses like hairdressers to finally reopen. Brits will also be able to mix indoors more at each othersapos homes as long as social distancing guidelines are followed. But Leicester Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby claims he has been told the city could have to wait for another fortnight to follow the rest of the country into the easing of the lockdown rules. The city has recorded  new cases of coronavirus in the last two weeks, leading to speculation over the weekend that it would be locked down. Home Secretary Priti Patel has confirmed the Government are considering a lockdown in the area.  Sir Peter said any extension would mean pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, outdoor playgrounds and other areas would not reopen as planned on July . Soldiers from the Royal Logistics Corps have been pictured at a new mobile coronavirus testing site at Evington Leisure Centre in Leicester this morning. Figures show the areas around England where Covid- cases were still rising in recent weeks. Doncaster has seen a spike in new cases - from  in the week to June  to  last week.  Derbyshire saw  new cases in the week to June , up from  the week before. Currently, the method being used by local authorities to control the virus focuses on closing down settings such as businesses and schools where there are flare ups - and contact tracing those affected. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described this as a whack-a-mole strategy. It is currently unclear how a lockdown in a particular town or city would work in practice. The Government and officials from Leicester were due to meet this afternoon to discuss the recommendations.  Other countries which have seen sudden spikes, such as Germany, are currently implementing similar localised lockdowns. Some  people are still testing positive for coronavirus every single day across the UK. The UK has now suffered more than , deaths from the virus, the worst death toll in Europe. The Government figures do not include all deaths involving Covid- across the UK, which are thought to have passed ,.  Areas with spiking coronavirus cases The English cities, counties and London boroughs which have seen coronavirus case rises in recent weeks are, in alphabetical order:Barking and Dagenham\u2028 Brent \u2028Derbyshire\u2028 Doncaster\u2028 Ealing\u2028 Enfield\u2028 Gateshead\u2028 Gloucestershire\u2028 Hammersmith and Fulham\u2028 Haringey\u2028 Harrow\u2028 Havering\u2028 Hounslow\u2028 Isle of Wight\u2028 Kensington and Cha\u2028 Leicester\u2028 Medway\u2028 Milton Keynes\u2028 Plymouth\u2028 Portsmouth\u2028 Redbridge\u2028 Redcar and Cleveland\u2028 Richmond upon Thames\u2028 Sandwell\u2028 Slough\u2028 Suffolk\u2028 Sunderland\u2028 Tower Hamlets\u2028 Wakefield\u2028 Walsall\u2028 Wandsworth\u2028 Westminster\u2028 Wigan\u2028 Wiltshire\u2028 Windsor and Maidenhead\u2028 YorkHow will areas be selected for localised lockdown  Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month said that regional flare-ups of the virus in England would result in local lockdown. He told a Downing Street briefing there would be local lockdowns in the future with the Joint Biosecurity Centre having a responsethat could address local spikes in infections, in partnership with local public health agencies.

In their book Royals at War, investigative journalists Dylan Howard and Andy Tillett claim Meghan made the decision to tell people - and it didnapost go down well with Harry. They claim that it left the Duke of Sussex embarrassed, and Princess Eugenie and her mum Sarah Ferguson furious. They write: Meghan put her foot in it when she decided that it would be the ideal moment to announce that she and Harry were expecting their first child. This was a huge social gaffe, evenyou were not a Royal – stealing the limelight from Eugenie, who was furious, as was her mother, Sarah. However when Archie arrived in May, the Queen, Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and other members of the family rushed to congratulate the couple, who are now living in LA.There were claims at the time that the announcement had upset the bride, with US gossip website Radar Online claiming it had angered Eugenie, who was already dealing with stress of criticism over her pricey wedding.Eugenie disappeared for a while after Harry and Meghan told the Royal Family the news, an insider allegedly said. Any bride would have had their nose put out of joint by something like that. At the time of the official announcement on October , many fans criticised Meghan and Harry for making the announcement so close to Eugenieaposs wedding.  There were several cruel claims on social media that the Sussexes had stolen Eugenie and Jackaposs thunder.However other claimed they were left with little choice because of their upcoming tour.One Twitter user wrote: If Harry and Meghan did actually tell the Royal Family about their baby at Eugenie’s wedding on Friday, that’s pretty shady.Another added: Meghan couldn’t let Eugenie be centre of attention for long could she. A third simply wrote: Thunder stealer.  Sarah Ferguson reacted by sharing photos of her daughter and new son-in-law just half an hour after Meghan and Harry made their official announcement. She tweeted: So proud of Eugenie and Jack #wedding at .am today, and also posted the same image on her official  Instagram  page."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\", url\"News, views and top stories .

Millie Radford is eagerly anticipating the birth of a little girl in September. The -year-old, who has decided to call her daughter Ophelia, is not an enormous fan of some of the effects of pregnancy.Alongside a photograph of herself that she posted on Instagram, Millie wrote: “As you can see all my weight is piling straight onto the face.Last week the young woman, who has  siblings, posted a D scan of Ophelia online.She wrote: We had our  week D scan yesterday at @takeapeeksthelens. Can’t believe how much she’s changed since my last scan.I love seeing how much she’s grown over the weeks. Baby O is still breech and she’s sticking her middle finger up already! Think I’m going to have my hands full with her. Along with dad Noel, , Millieaposs mum Sue, , has welcomed an astonishing number of children.  Most of the sizeable family live in a converted care home in Morecambe, where they run the Radfordaposs Pie Company. In a family update posted on YouTube last week Millie was surprised by her family with an influx of gts for her baby.

For the past three months many Brits have had to forgo their favourite pastime of going to the pub because of the coronavirus pandemic. While more than , people have died in the UK from Covid-, the daily death rate is now low enough for the Government to ease lockdown restrictions on restaurants, bars and pubs. However, things will not be going straight back to normal. When their doors open at the weekend people will only be able to meet up with members of one other household. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror As well as deciding who you want to share your first frosty pint of the summer with ahead of time, it may be wise to book in advance. Many pubs are only accepting people who have booked places due to lower than normal capacities. Drinks are required to reserve a seat in stripped down boozers that have removed seats and tables to allow for social distancing. For those lucky enough to find themselves inside, then a set of rules will govern how the night unfolds. While ordering at the bar is not banned, drinking at it is.  Pubs will also have to have new measures in place to make sure people can stand at least a metre apart from each other with added mitigation - which could include perspex screens and masks, gloves or visors for staff. As a result, many pubs are expected to only offer table service or encourage customers to user ordering apps. Pub visitors will also be asked to give their name to the pub landlord at the door. This temporary record will now be kept by pubs for  days so those who visit can be contactedthere is a breakout of localised coronavirus. Inside pubs, one-way systems will be used to ensure people do not cross paths.  It is hoped that single-direction traffic inside will reduce congestion and minimise contact between customers. The Government guidance also outlines that doors should be left open, where appropriate, to reduce touchpoints. Maintaining good ventilation is also important and therefore windows and doors should be kept open as much as possible. In addition, pubs are urged to use a one in one out system with toilets to minimise customer interaction. Live performances are not permitted, including music, drama and comedy. Although this will not be a strict rule, customers are asked not to speak too loudly in a bid to lower the chances of oral tranmission.  The Government guidance reads: “All venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. “This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. “This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.” When sitting inside pubs or restaurants, people will be allowed to gather at a social distance in groups of six, with a maximum of two households involved. This six-person limit will also apply to pub gardens, although friends from more than two households will be permitted to socialise.

The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse heard on Monday allegations of widespread historic abuse at ious childrenaposs homes run by Lambeth Council. Former residents who lived at the homes in the s, s and s claimed they were physically and sexually abused by those in charge of their care at the time. The inquiry, which is due to last four weeks, will investigate whether there were child protection failures by public authorities, including the police and council. Rachel Langdale QC, counsel to the inquiry, said the councilaposs Angell Road home - which opened in  - was run by the convicted child sex abuser Michael Carroll, who was also known as John Carroll.  She told the inquiry that Carroll had concealed his criminal past when he applied for a role at the childrenaposs home, but added that Lambeth Council later became aware of his background. Ms Langdale said: You will hear that Lambeth came to know of his conviction from Croydon Council when Carroll and his we applied to become foster parents . She added: Lambeth officials decided that Carroll should not be dismissed on account of his previous conviction, nor on account of his concealment of it. Carroll was dismissed in  because of financial irregularities, Ms Langdale said. He was jailed for  years at Liverpool Crown Court in  after admitting a string of sexual assaults against children while working in residential care between  and . The inquiry also heard allegations of physical and sexual assault taking place at the councilaposs other childrenaposs homes, including Shirley Oaks, the South Vale Assessment Centre and Ivy House.  Ms Langdale said Shirley Oaks was the oldest and largest residential care home for children aged two to  years under the control of Lambeth Council. The home allowed for members of the public, known as social aunts and uncles, to volunteer to spend time with children by taking them away on day trips or on holiday, the inquiry heard. Ms Langdale said Lambeth Council accepts that during the operational period of Shirley Oaks, which could house up to  children, there were no requirements for staff to hold social work qualications or to be police checked. It appears the doors to Shirley Oaks, in essence, may have been open to any adult professing an interest in taking children out, she said.

Footage shows the woman appearing to kick the birds before an older man tries to to intervene and is pushed into the water in Limehouse, east London. Police are appealing for information about the woman and a man who was with her following the incident on Friday. The pair were part of a group of around  people gathered around the edge of the water. Footage has gone viral of the woman apparently kicking the swans but witnesses claim that she was merely trying to break up a vicious fight between them. However, as an older man spoke to them a youth in a blue t-shirt shoved him into the water below. It was initially claimed the swans had been mating before they were kicked but witnesses say that several people had tried to separate the fighting birds before the woman intervened.One told MailOnline : I watched the entire episode and the swans were not mating, they were fighting to the death. One was father of nine cygnets nearby and one was from a pair who were being territorial.The one to pursue is the idiot boy in the blue shirt who pushed the man in the canal. A second witness said: Obviously this is irrelevant to the pushing into the water of the man who intervened. But the people involved were not just baiting the swans - it was an attempt to break up an attack. A third person also claimed the woman was trying to break up the fighting swans adding the footage failed to show what happened before the woman intervened. The politan Police said an investigation into the incident and efforts to trace the man and woman involved were ongoing.Superintendent Andy Cox previously said: Awful viewing. Animal cruelty is an indicator of many other vile behaviours and a tendency towards other forms of violence. The assault  anti social behaviour needs our action.

Rachel held this woman and talked to her so nicely and helped her as well as the paramedics that came later. She held her for at least  minutes until the EMTs got her on a stretcher. I am so blessed to have a wonderful we who will always take care of people who need it, and we were blessed that we were able to be in the right place at the right time to make a dference. Rachel and I are on our way to our honeymoon, and I am still blown away that she got out of the car in a scary situation to do what she does best. I can’t wait for a hospital to scoop her up so she can make a dference in people’s lives every day. I am so proud of my we. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my le with someone who is truly a servant of God, and to serve alongside her. The injured woman in the picture is reportedly Tamara Peterson. A car and a van had reportedly crashed in the St South Paul area of the city, and while the occupants were talking, a third vehicle came through the intersection and ran into the other cars. According to a crowdfunder set up for Ms Peterson by her daughter, she had arrived at the scene after her son was involved in the initial crash. When the third vehicle piled up she was hit too and she became pinned between two cars.Mrs Taylor told local newspaper Mercury News : I saw a couple of people dragging a woman over to the side of the road, Taylor said.I could see a gash in her right leg.

At first, she thought it was a joke, but eventually realised the man she had been reading “every word” about in the local papers was now before her. “He snarled at me several times in a harsh whisper, ‘This isn’t a joke’,” says Margaret, now aged . “Then, in my mind, bam, I knew it was him.” For more than  years, former police officer Joseph DeAngelo terried Calornia. From Sacramento to Los Angeles, the sadistic predator violated peaceful communities with countless rapes and killings. He started in  as a burglar, but escalated to rape and then murder. First known as the East Area Rapist, he ended up being hunted as the “Golden State Killer”. Today he is expected to plead guilty to  charges of murder and rape, to avoid the death penalty. The -year-old was facing a lethal injectionfound guilty, but he is set to admit his crimes at a hearing where his victims will finally come face-to-face with the killer before he is left to die in prison. Margaret, who is set to attend the Sacramento hearing, told how she had gone to sleep around pm on November , , after dinner with her mother, Delores, at their neighbour’s house in the State capital. The realisation about her attacker was confirmed when, bound and gagged, she heard him fetch kitchen crockery. For his attacks all had the same sickening hallmark. DeAngelo would tie up all the others in the house and place a cup on and saucer on their back as he raped his victim. He threatened to kill themhe heard a sound. For years the warnings were just threats until in  he killed his first victims.  Margaret adds: “I heard those plates rattling and him on the stairs. I deducted very simply, very quickly, very logically and very, very calmly what was going to happen.” But instead of being overawed by panic or paralysed with fear, Margaret said, because of what she knew about DeAngelo, her teen defiance took over. “I just calmly accepted it. It was almost like I had somebody here on my shoulder saying, ‘you’re going to be raped. This is what’s going to happen, but you’re going to live. You’re going to survive. You’re going to be okay’. “I knew he wasn’t going to hurt me or kill me as he was threatening the whole time. I was positive from how much I’d read how he operated.  “I was p****d off. I was mad. I was defiant. I was thinking like ‘Why are you here  What are you doing here  How dare you ’ I don’t remember fear. “He wanted fear. I knew he wanted the power through this fear thing, but I wasn’t going to give him that.” Margaret says the rape ordeal lasted  minutes before her attacker fled. For  years detectives were clueless as to who was breaking into dozens of houses.  Hours before his attacks, he would slip into often unlocked properties to learn the layout, cutting phone lines, clearing potential exits and even emptying guns kept by owner’s bedsides. Husbands and boyfriends were of no concern.

Alexandra Jechorek, , was astonished when her daughter, Maya, had a glossy mane before she was even born. The Dublin woman had been born bald, the same as her office worker boyfriend, Lee Bond, , and their son, Kadin, five. This led the stay-at-home mum to believe that all babies came out of the womb that way. She said: Weaposd already found out we were expecting a girl at the previous scan, so at  weeks, we were just excited to see how much sheaposd grown.Was your baby born with an amazing amount of hair  Email webnews@mirrorWhen the midwe turned the screen around, I honestly couldnapost believe my eyes. There was this tiny little baby on the scan with a full head of hair. I just thought, aposNo way, this cannot be possibleapos. To be completely honest, I thought all babies were born bald. My oldest Kadin came out bald, so I just thought that was how babies were when they were born. But once Iaposd taken in how much hair she had, it made me all the more excited to meet her, as Maya already looked like a proper little person. Six weeks later, on June , , Maya was born at The Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, in Dublin, weighing lbs oz.  Alexandra laughed: As soon as Maya arrived, I couldnapost take my eyes off her hair. Iaposd been expecting her to have hair because of the scan, but to see this beautul baby with this thick jet black hair was incredible. It had already grown so long it was down past her ears. Even the nurses and the doctors turned to me and said theyaposd never seen a baby with so much hair in all the time theyaposd worked at the hospital. Soon Mayaaposs incredible mop was commanding attention everywhere she went.  We couldnapost leave the house without someone complimenting Maya on her hair, Alexandra said. Lots of people would ask, aposHow old is she apos They were shocked when I told them she was only three months old with so much hair! While Alexandra has never measured her daughteraposs locks, she says that, now one years old, it is so long that it skims the top of her nappy. She said: Iaposve never had her hair cut. I think itaposs absolutely beautul and I want her to grow it as long as she wants. Having such long hair means Maya has already been able to experiment with a host of dferent styles. Her mum shows them off on her very own Instagram site, where she already has  followers.Mayaaposs really good she always sits still and lets me do her hair, said Alexandra. I do it in plaits and sometimes I tie it in a ponytail. I love putting bow clips in her hair. I have dferent colours, like pink, blue, red and yellow, to match the dferent outfits that she wears. Mayaaposs beautul hair means that, despite her tender age, her mum puts her through a demanding regime.  I shampoo and conditioner her hair every day, said Alexandra. Then I brush it through and spray on some stay-in conditioner and dry it with a towel. It takes about  minutes, which is quite a long time considering Iaposm doing a one year oldaposs hair. With her Instagram profile growing, Alexandra now hopes one day to launch Maya as a baby model. People love looking at pictures of Maya - they canapost get enough of her hair, she said. I usually post pictures of her dferent hairstyles or of her playing with Kadin.  But the comments are always about how amazing Mayaaposs hair is. With no family history of babies with hair, Alexandra says Mayaaposs amazing mop is a complete fluke. She said: Iaposve asked around my family and Leeaposs to seeanyone  was born with hair like Mayaaposs, but everyoneaposs told me no, so it mustaposve just been a fluke. And itaposs weird that she has such dark hair, as when Kadin was a baby, he had such fine blond hair.

The asteroid, which struck the Earth off the coast of Mexico  million years ago, has long been believed to have killed off all dinosaur species except those that became birds. But some researchers have suggested that tens of thousands of years of large volcanic eruptions may have been the actual cause of the extinction event. Now researchers from Imperial College London, the University of Bristol and University College London have now shown that only the asteroid impact could have created conditions that made the planet uninhabitable for dinosaurs. They also suggest the massive volcanism could also have helped le recover from the asteroid strike in the long-term. Lead researcher Dr Alessandro Chiarenza, who conducted this work whilst studying for his PhD at Imperial, said: We show that the asteroid caused an impact winter for decades, and that these environmental effects decimated suitable environments for dinosaurs. In contrast, the effects of the intense volcanic eruptions were not strong enough to substantially disrupt global ecosystems.  Our study confirms, for the first time quantitatively, that the only plausible explanation for the extinction is the impact winter that eradicated dinosaur habitats worldwide. Research suggests the asteroid strike would have released particles and gases high into the atmosphere, blocking out the Sun for years and causing permanent winters. Volcanic eruptions also produce particles and gases with Sun-blocking effects, and around the time of the mass extinction there were tens of thousands of years of eruptions at the Deccan Traps, in present-day India.  To determine whether the asteroid or volcanism had more climate-changing power, researchers have traditionally used geological markers of climate and powerful mathematical models. In the new paper they combined these methods with information about what kinds of environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature, each species of dinosaur needed to thrive. They then mapped where these conditions would still exist in a world after either an asteroid strike or massive volcanism, and found that only the asteroid strike wiped out all potential dinosaur habitats.

The new type of flu causes respiratory illnesses, and researchers say it is a candidate for the next viral pandemicit mutates and spreads from person to person. The strain, named G EA HN, thrives and multiplies in the cells that grow in the human airway. It recently emerged in pigs but can infect humans too, according to new research published in a journal article.The warning comes as the world remains in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic.Global Covid- deaths have passed ,, with millions more cases diagnosed since it was first reported to have emerged in China in December. The scientists wrote about the emerging influenza threat in the US journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, saying it had all the essential hallmarks of a candidate pandemic virus. Similarly, animal-borne Covid- is believed to have originated at a aposwet marketapos selling wildle for consumption in Wuhan, before the virus spread around the world. They researchers also found evidence of recent infection with the new influenza virus originating with people who worked in abattoirs and the swine farming industry in China. The virus is termed as a G genotype, which the researchers said had become predominant in swine populations since .  The researchers urged urgent monitoring of pigs and people who came into contact with the new influenza strain. Following the Swine Flu outbreak of , that virusis now covered by the annual flu vaccine. Immunity and vaccines against seasonal influenza that are already common among human populations do not appear to protect people from the new G virus, the study warned.

By the time she was just  Mariam had given birth to another  babies, which she is having to raise alone after her husband walked out on the giant family. Now , Mariam has been told she suffers from a rare genetic condition, which means she kept having multiple births - despite begging doctors for help when she was just . Mariam has three sets of quadruplets, four sets of triplets and six sets of twins and incredibly manages to care for and feed them all on her own. The fertile mum was just  when she was married to her husband, who at  was  years her senior. Just a year later she gave birth to her first set of twins. Now, she and all of her kids have no choice to live in appallingly cramped conditions in just four tiny homes made from cement bricks and a corrugated iron roof. Mariam, from Uganda, and her brood live surrounded by coffee fields. A doctor warned the mother that birth control, like the Pill, could cause her problems because she had unusually large oies. So after her first set of twins, the babies just kept coming. Ugandan families are often large with women having . children on average. This is one of the highest birth rates in Africa but even by these standards, Mariamaposs family is enormous. At just , Mariam had  children and desperately begged her doctor for help to stop her having any more. But once again the medical advice was that she should keep getting pregnant because her oy count was so high. Mariamaposs final pregnancy three years ago ended in tragedy when she gave birth to her sixth set of twins. One of the babies died while she was in labour and then her husband, who would often leave for weeks on end, left her for good. His name is now cursed in her family. Mariam said: I have grown up in tears, my man has passed me through a lot of suffering. All my time has been spent looking after my children and working to earn some money. But it was also after this birth that the mum finally got the medical help she needed to stop her having more babies. Dr Charles Kiggundu, a gynecologist at Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda, said: Her case is genetic predisposition to hyper-ovulate, which is releasing multiple eggs in one cycle, which signicantly increases the chance of having multiples it is always genetic. Mariam confirmed that doctors had taken action to remove the risk of her becoming pregnant again. She said the doctor told her he had cut my uterus from inside. Nothing will come in the way of the dedicated mother doing all she can to provide for her children. She works as a hairdresser, an event decorator and collects and sells scrap metal. Mariam brews her own local gin to sell and makes herbal medicine. And she is determined her surviving children will have the very best start to le with most of her wages going on food, medical care, clothes and school fees. Hanging proudly on the wall of her tiny home are photos of her eldest children graduating from school. Despite Mariamaposs best efforts, one of her children, Ivan Kibuka, had to quit school to help raise the family. The -year-old said: Mum is overwhelmed, the work is crushing her, we help where we can, like in cooking and washing, but she still carries the whole burden for the family. I feel for her. Even Mariamaposs early years were filled with heartbreak. Her mum walked out on her, her father and her five brothers and sisters just three days after she gave birth to Mariam. He father re-married and Mariamaposs step-mother poisoned her older siblings by mixing cut glass in with their food. They all died. A visit to a relative meant Mariam escaped with her le. She said: I was seven years old then, too young to even understand what death actually meant.I was told by relatives what had happened. The scars of her ordeal meant Mariam was desperate for a family of her own to love, although she admits she only ever wanted six children. Her youngsters have to make the best of what she manages to provide as a single parent. Metal bunk beds with thin mattresses are where  of her brood sleep in one small room with walls caked with grime. Others have to share mattresses on the floor while some of the children are forced to sleep in the dirt because there is simply no space.  Everyone piles in to help with chores like cooking and clearning while the older children look after their younger siblings. Each day, Mariam uses kgs of maize floor to ensure her children have enough to eat. Although fish and meat are rare treats for the family. Mariam has to be organised to make sure each day runs smoothly on there is a rota of cooking and washing duties on a wooden board in the family home.

That wasn’t money we were relying on.“If we had benefited from that it would have gone a huge way to helping us through this crisis now and with the investment made in Cormack Park as well.“However, we have a number of players operating in England that we could still benefit from further down the line. It didn’t come off with Ryan but hopefully comes off further down the line.”Aberdeen recently unveiled a playing philosophy and refreshed football strategy aimed at inspiring fans with exciting football. Fundamental to that is bringing through young talent.Now in his th year at Pittodrie, Gunn said: “An important aspect is player development and home-grown talent.“There are two elements why we want to be stronger in that area. One is getting that identity into the team that fans relate to.“The other is developing players to a level that we can monetise them at a later stage.“We get them into our team through the academy or we recruit players from other clubs in Scotland. You have seen us take Michael Ruth from Queen’s Park and Mark Gallagher from Ross County.“We need to get those players the exposure they need and get them to a level.“The plan is to get the contract strategy right and make sure we get best value from these guys when they hopefully move on to bigger and better things.“The idea is we can reinvest back into the football operation and make us stronger again.”Aberdeen have created a visible pathway from the youngest of the  youth academy players right through to the first team squad.Gunn said: “We have been reviewing everything we do from recruitment, coaching, style of play and our philosophy.“We have involved everyone in the football department with that dialogue.“It started with myself and Derek going back nine months ago. What we have released in the last few days is the fruits of that.“We have shared that with all part-time academy coaches, scouts, academy players, parents and full-time staff connected on the football side.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsRumour has it the UK government will bring in a -day quarantine for some # but not all # airline passengers at the end of this month.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

It shows contempt for those in the NHS who have risked their lives to save others. It shows contempt for those who have died without their loved ones by their side.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

He knew how to whet my appetite.\"Yet the characters arent the only element getting a makeover: billed as the originals \"spiritual descendant\", the brand-new -part series will transport viewers from Ripper-era London to the Golden Age of Hollywood in  Los Angeles.A time and place deeply infused with social and political tension, the sequel - which opens with a grisly murder - sees detectives Tiago Vegaand Lewis Michenerbattling the citys rich history. From the building of the first freeways and its traditions of Mexican-American folklore, to the dangerous espionage actions of the Third Reich and the rise of radio evangelism.In amongst the uprising, Kinnear plays Dr Peter Craft, a father of two who flits between caring paediatrician and his turn as head of the German-American Bund, an organisation he hopes will keep the United States isolated from the growing threat of war in Europe.\"Peter has a lot in common with a lot of characters in the show in that theyre all complex, conflicted, and struggling to do the right thing whilst coming up against temptation,\" says the star, whos also worked with screenwriter Logan on Bond films Skyfall and Spectre.\"He has a troubled home le, in that his we is an alcoholic and has seemingly cut herself off from looking after their children,\" he continues. \"And his profession is all about looking after kids, so were expecting that [viewers] sympathise with him.\"But obviously in meeting Elsa, the path thats in front of him changes, and as a result the audience may have their sympathies change as well.\"Elsa is just one of a number of guises adopted by Natalie Dormers character, Magda.Dubbed a supernatural demon who can assume the form of anyone she chooses, the Game Of Thrones actress - whose character believes humankind is evil - has her work cut out, as she shts between blonde German housewe Elsa, government assistant Alex, and androgynous freedom fighter Rio.Her goal: to prove her point by nudging the city towards a race war.It was a major endeavour, says the -year-old, \"in so far as its a physical and mental exercise because its four characterisations for the price of one\".\"We realised quite quickly that I had to play them as separate entities becauseyou dont play Elsa and Rio and Alex as fully fleshed out, three-dimensional characters, not only are you doing a disservice to your co-stars, the truth of the entire thing gets completely lost.\"And that actually, speaking in a pure sense as an actor, in terms of craft, its a joy because it means you have a lot of fun playing with the physicality, with voices, accents, and the costume and hair department...\" she notes.\"I was very pleased to be a stage-trained, classically trained British actor because I really did go right back to my training, in order to do this sort of exercise. It was a nice challenge.\"Similarly, Kinnear states: \"I like playing characters with lots of dferent shades [and] Peter comes upon a fairly invincible force in the shape of Elsa and Magda.\"But we dont know how much strength he has in him to withstand that temptation,\" he teases. \"You see over the course of the  episodes that he does try, and hes also trying to stand up to the more radical, Nazi wing of the German-American Bund as well, to try and make the claim for peace.\"Peter is almost the inverse of the Creature, really he is trying desperately to push down his true identity and create someone completely anew. Whereas the Creature was in constant search of his origin and identity.\"\"Magda has this theory that all mankind needs to become the monster he truly is, is to be told that he can, Dormer follows.\"For me, theres a bit of a premise that good people do bad things, whether its to do with threatening their family, their country or their vulnerability. Its that philosophical question of what it takes to bring out the uglier side in all of us.\"As for the shows key political themes - take othering, racism, and isions in society, for example - it seems theyre as relevant today as they ever were.\"What this shows is that all the tensions and dficulties of any large city, which has had a history of oppressing minority groups, have not gone away, and that they will continue to resurfacetheyre not fully addressed or addressed honestly,\" recognises Kinnear.Can he pinpoint a link between the first iteration and this \"I think its that focus on how the supernatural plays out in real peoples lives and the strength of feeling that it can still provoke not only in the s, but today as well,\" he muses.\"The first Penny Dreadful was all about the monsters that lie within us and it was using largely pre-existing literary characters,\" reasons the father of two.\"This one focuses on that same thing, but also the sense of no matter how much you study and learn, there are things that exist beyond us, beyond our comprehension, which we try to give names to.\"That can lead to fears, whether irrational or not, but it can also give succour and strength as well.\"Is there room for another series \"John is always several steps ahead,\" Kinnear finishes. \"Not only is he so extraordinarily prolic in terms of all the output that he has, across so many dferent disciplines, he really enjoys it - and Penny Dreadful was his first time doing long-form TV!\"There are lots of surprises thrown up in that, but you do have to plan your first three series because thats always the hope!\"Watch all episodes of Penny Dreadful: City Of Angels on Sky Atlantic and streaming service NOW TV from Wednesday, July ."},{"url":null,"title":"feeling-nostalgic-summer-gala-days-years-gone","story":"It has been many years since I last attended Blackridge Gala Day, yet Ive found myself thinking about it a lot lately. Perhaps with all of the usual white noise of le stripped away, something deep-rooted in my memories has stirred and bubbled to the surface.I was less than a year old at my first gala day in . While I dont remember it, I know from photographs that my gran pulled out all the stops. The outside of her house and garden was beautully adorned with colourful bunting and decorations.This was a tradition that continued throughout my childhood. As I got older, I would excitedly jump from our old Datsun and go tearing in through the front gate, imagining the impressed faces of the judges as they scored the best-dressed house competition.The day itself followed a set routine. The parade was first, and without fail I would be cajoling everyone to make haste down the steep hill from my gran and grandpas house to the main street, my heart thudding in my chest with fear we might miss it.:Susan Swarbrick: Pondering the le lessons of dirty laundryI could already hear the skirl of bagpipes and thump of a bass drum at the far end of the village. Id listen as they steadily grew closer, craning my neck to catch a glimpse of the first float.My gran saved up coppers all year in an old Epsom salt jar, which gave them a dusty sheen that felt gritty and sometimes sticky as I grabbed a handful to throw into the passing collection bucketsAfter the parade, came the park. There would be stalls and races. This was also where you would collect the hallowed gala day box containing a gluttony of treats: a cold pie or sausage roll, a Mars bar, crisps, an iced cake and a plastic carton of juice.Id be allowed to eat one thing because a banquet awaited back at the house, my gran serving up dish after dish, just like she had when in service at a big house in Glasgow many years before.Usually by then the gala day committee would have been round to do the judging and a small piece of card would be proudly taped to the living room window, denoting a placing in the contest for best-dressed house. She even won one year.Rounding off the day was a visit to the shows, where we would eat candy floss, hook a duck, ride the carousel, tear around on the dodgems and take a spin on the waltzers until I was either feeling sick or had run out of pocket money.:Susan Swarbrick: Ill brave the midges this summer ndash our tourism sector needs usThere are no gala days this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, although I hope that, like me, in villages and towns across Scotland, there are others who are fondly reminiscing.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He was responsible for the deaths of more than  million of his own people whom he treated with total disdain and immense cruelty. Yet today Mao still has pride of place in Tiananmen Square and is officially revered by the Chinese population, of whom less than one per cent know the real truth of what really happened under Mao ndash and he only died in .While we in the West need to face up to our history, I seriously doubt that anyone will be holding the Chinese Communist Party to account for its past history.Letrsquos seethere are any protests, with or without kettling, in Tiananmen Square any time soon. Good luck having a BLM or statue protest there. The fact that we can have these protests is down to our democracy that we enjoy and be grateful.While we need to seriously reflect on our ancestorrsquos misdemeanours, we should not ignore other brutal regimes that still perpetuate to this day and we seem to give them for some reason, perhaps fear, a free pass.Ian McNair, Cellardyke.Time to relaunch the ferries projectTHE Covid emergency seems to have pushed the two new ferries being built for CalMac off the news agenda .

Given the traumas of re-location and being housed with strangers schooling must have been dficult to say the least. Since many thousands of male teachers must have died in the First War and many thousands more had been called-up or volunteered in the Second, added to which married female teachers were not allowed by law to teach until , class sizes must have been enormous at a time when teaching resources were very scarce.Yet we now look back at the s and s when these children became the working population as some sort of golden age.

Firstly, under the previous guidance, education authorities were asked to be ldquocreative and imaginative in their drafting of their planning for theand many were far from that. Secondly and, more importantly, there was growing evidence about the detrimental effect on the wellbeing and mental health of our children from lack of contact with their pals and outdoor play opportunities as a result of the lockdown.A recent report, commissioned by the UKrsquos Play Safety Forum and written by David Ball, Professor of Risk Management at Middlesex University, contained evidence causing the author to come to the conclusion that the UK policy was much more harmful to children than beneficial. Citing statistics showing the extremely low risk to children from the virus and the evidence that childrenrsquos role in transmitting the virus being fairly limited, the report urges that childrenrsquos social and emotional wellbeing be prioritised in all decisions relating to the easing of lockdown and re-opening of schools.Also quoted in the report is the scientic consensus that the risk of transmission of Covid- is much lower outdoors than indoors due to air movement and the effect of UV light on the virus and on contaminated materials. All this would support allowing children to play together outdoors and to increase the trend to more outdoor education.

To do such a thing in these dficult days with businesses struggling due to lockdown and many people facing economic hardship is not just \"plane daft\" and an expensive and insensitive waste of public money, it suggests that Mr Johnson is up in the clouds when it comes to making sensible decisions, and one can only wonder what role his top political adviser and co-pilot Dominic Cummings played in this flight of fancy. Was it for advice like this that the Prime Minister stubbornly clung to Mr Cummings in the teeth of the publics disgust Mr Johnson needs to be brought back to earth with a bump, and face being grounded, permanently.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Keep an open mind on climate changeNEIL Rothnieobviously doesnt know that there are many theories on what makes the climate change, so I will enlighten him.He knows of the warming theory involving man-made greenhouse gases. The late Stephen Schneider was a leading proponent of this in  he announced to the world his concern for the build-up of CO in the atmosphere. Incidentally, pre- he was warning the world of a looming global cooling crisis, but all of his cooling work has been deleted.Many alternative theories on climate have been announced. In  Henrik Svensmark published his first paper on the link between cosmic rays and climate. In  Nicola Scafetta announced his research suggesting that most climate change is due to the influence of planetary motion on the sun, and William Gray suggested ocean currents. In  James Kamis suggested that mantle plumes and plate tectonics drove the climate, and in  Arthur Viterito suggested vulcanology.Many scientists have claimed that changes in the earths magnetic field are the dominant driving force on climate, or that simply nobody really knows.I respectfully suggest that Mr Rothnie be more open-minded.Geoff Moore, Alness.NEIL Rothnie may be genuine in his beliefs that mankind can save the planet by giving up fossil fuels His contempt for the North Sea oil industry is puzzling, since without it the UK would have been held to ransom by foreign nations. The UK has a miniscule . per cent of global emissions, Scotland .%, but ChinaIndiaand numerous other countries are still building coal-fired plants to drive their economies using cheap fossil-generated electricity, not mega-expensive wind electricity.Mr Rothnie mentions climate chaos but he, and others who believe the computer climate modelling forecasts, will be upset to learn that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has, once again, stated that there is little basis for claiming that droughts, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes have increased, much less increased due to greenhouse gases.Ever since climate scientists realised that there was a comfortable living to be made out of the threat of global warming there have been many hundreds of scary predictions, all of which failed to come to fruition.Will Mr Rothnie vow not to own, use or travel in any products which were derived from fossil fuels Clark Cross, Linlithgow.Why statues need to be removed\"MY name is Ozymandias, king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty and despair!rsquoThus wrote Shelley in a poem subverting the vanity of power embodied in a statue.I would generally support the views expressed by Professor Wardle in his letterand the article by Kevin Mc Kennawhere Sir Tom Devine makes his arguments for a deeper scrutiny of Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade. Their views on the latter cannot be seriously contested.What is a statue  It is surely, amongst other things, an attempt to transcend time and space. These petried representatives of horror that fill our public spaces are not merely signicant in their materiality, they are also important as figurative projections of power, rank and prestige propelled from the past into the present. The intention behind them was that they were to be honoured and acknowledged as emblems of a dominant class who took their barbarous rule as a natural right. More importantly, they help underpin that same domination today.Any statue is both a presence and an absence. All statues fill a space and, simultaneously, obscure and conceal. I would argue that the removal of these monstrosities would help reveal the more authentic history desired by Prof Wardle and Sir Tom.Finally,we are to fully examine Scotlandrsquos role in the slave trade, we should endeavour to avoid clumsy conflations. The Scottish millworker and the Scottish crewman did not \"benefit\" from slavery. They were part of a dynamic of capitalist accumulation in which they had little say and little power. They led miserable lives characterised by long hours, disease and premature death. If Sir Tom wishes to insist they did benefit then he should at least employ some form of calibration and dferentiation. The slave owner and the merchant stole the lives of the slave and the wage slave.Alex Porter, Stirling.BEING a naturalised Scot of mixed West Indian British heritage, I have a concern that the more admirable aspects of the Black Lives Matter campaign are being ruined by a very sinister development.\"Taking the Knee\", originally a brave and meaningful gesture by black American sportsmen and equality campaigners, later adopted by supporters of all races, has been devalued by the way the media are using it.Singling out any public figure who is not an enthusiastic \"knee taker\" for opprobrium, effectively makes the act compulsory for anyone who does not want to risk their reputation, their job, or harassment by a large and angry segment of society.Many non-believers living in extremely strict religious communities will attend or comply with the requirements of that religion in order to fit in and avoid persecution ndash even though they live otherwise blameless and good lives. Compulsory gestures of solidarity or belief have no real value to any cause as they make it impossible to judge the true extent of \"belief\". Obligatory worship or participation in religious ritual by non-believers cannot be of any value to the Deity concerned.Neither politicians nor anyone  should be questioned or criticised about their non-participation in someone rsquos gestures or rituals. Instead, judge them by what they are actively doing in le to make things better now and in the future.Mark Openhsaw, Aberdeen.Degrees of stupidityI AGREE entirely with Priscilla Douglasrsquos rebuttal of Iain Macwhirterrsquos conflation of education and intelligence .Some years ago, I worked for a public service organisation whose basic entry requirements were numeracy, literacy and physical fitness.

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how one company has been helped, and what support is available. vw, px\"  When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh.The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. vw, px\"  Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency.In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with £m of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.The £, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. vw, px\"  Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable.“Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.”The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest.“Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.”For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit.“There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said.“But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.”Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings.Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. , jobs in Scotand have been furloughed through the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme up to May ., claims amounting to £ million through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme up to May .%of those eligible for SEISS made a claim.

It reflects the additional constraints faced by farm businesses in these communities and provides much needed financial stability.“In the midst of a pandemic, with the UK’s impending departure from the EU, there is no lack of challenges facing the farming sector at the moment. At a time of such uncertainty, retaining the benefits that LFASS delivers would seem both sensible and desirable.“The group established by the minister to develop proposals for future farm support post-Brexit is due to report shortly. It is right that consideration is given to the way funding is allocated across the board.“However, as Fergus Ewing rightly acknowledged, LFASS has shown itself to be particularly good at targeting support where it is most needed.  Moreover, in helping sustain farming and crofting in some of our most fragile areas, it also plays a pivotal role in building community cohesion.“These are ‘public goods’ we should value and protect and I am pleased that the minister seems up for the fight in ensuring this happens.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Some of these people are living with dementia and others are unpaid carers, often family, supporting people living with dementia.“There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatisation, inequality and barriers to diagnosis and care. The impact of dementia on carers, family and wider society can be physical, psychological, social and economic. We need to adopt a social model of dementia as a disability, recognising the challenges people with dementia face and affording the same priority to reduce impact, as we do for physical disabilities. Dementia is one of the foremost public health challenges worldwide. There is currently no cure for dementia. However, there are treatments, therapies and supports which are effective in maintaining skills and independence and contributing positively to the experiences of people with dementia and unpaid carers.”With an ageing population within Orkney, a projected increase in numbers of people with dementia presents a range of challenges, not only for the people who develop dementia, and their families and carers, but also for the statutory and voluntary services that provide care and support, Gillian Coghill explained.She said: “If the estimated prevalence rates remain similar, the number of people living with dementia in Orkney is set to almost double between  and , increasing from  to  people. We need to develop innovative ways to build capacity, resilience within financial constraints.”The five-year strategy provides a framework for improvement in support and services for people with a diagnosis of dementia and those who provide unpaid support for them throughout communities in Orkney, Ms Coghill added.“This strategy aspires to highlight the importance of risk reduction, early diagnosis and access to high quality post diagnostic support which is dynamic to needs, strengths and identied personal outcomes for people with dementia.“It recognises the positive contribution and need to support carers, volunteers and staff and has been developed from a grass roots perspective. It supports Community Led Support and the need for integrated systems, which promote enablement and uphold rights for people with dementia, the building of dementia friendly communities and increasing community capacity to enable people with dementia to live well, without stigma as a valued part of their community and in their own homes when possible.“This strategy evidences the importance of planning and developing services and supports for and with people living with dementia. It addresses the challenges involved in meeting the needs of the growing number of people who will be diagnosed with dementia, recognising the unique challenges and strengths of the Orkney community. It supports the right care, in the right place at the right time by the right people.“There is recognition of the need to do things dferently, both in relation to people’s experiences and to ensure a sustainable model of support. We need to work together with all relevant people and groups to design and deliver the best care and support we can. This provides us with an opportunity to make changes which support the appropriate level of priority and investment needed for dementia in Orkney. We need to ensure that dementia is prioritised and kept firmly on the agenda in all relevant policies, procedures and plans.”Members of the IJB approved the strategy and consultation will now take place with key stakeholders, results of which will be presented to the board at a future meeting, no later than September .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SCT was delighted to secure a £, grant from the SSE Sustainable Development Fund last month, and hopes to soon confirm the final funding package.SCT bought the site, near Bun-Sgoil Stafainn, from the Stenscholl Township and Kilmuir Estatefor £,, using a grant from the Scottish Land Fund.It followed the conclusion of the Resumption process, removing the development site from crofting tenure, which was approved by the Scottish Land Court earlier this year.SCT director Calum MacDonald said: “The progress made is a great achievement for the community. I know that the community recognises that affordable housing is long overdue.#Welcoming families in need of such accommodation, and who are very keen to live in Staffin, will be a great boost to our village.”HSCHT chief executive Ronnie MacRae said: “The health, economic and social benefits of this scheme will undoubtedly give Staffin strong foundations to build on.”Lachie MacDonald, LSHA chief executive association, added: “We are delighted that this rural mixed-use development is about to start on site. Staffin Community Trust is to be applauded for their vision and determination to drive forward this project.

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/PARKING-FAIRY-POOLS-4.jpg","title":"letters mothball tourism until vaccine praise for responsible","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOn a purely local, Highland level, with Test, Track and Trace in place, there is much to commend that view.There is also a view widely supported that the Tourist Industry should be restarted.I use the phrase Test, Track and Trace because it closely illustrates what must be done.I asked VisitScotland how many tourists they expected this summer in the Highlands. They had absolutely no idea.What we can surmise is that to anyone where in the UK this looks like a great, safe, destination.It doesn’t really matter because one infected person, , could result in  being infected  days later, and, unchecked, every three days after that the number of infections doubles.If you were on a family holiday and you had very mild symptoms, would you report them, or think you had a summer cold Let us be absolutely clear that the only reason this “R” number is where it is, is because we have all been kept in our homes to stop the virus spreading.The virus is still out there.The stated defence, in fact the only defence, , against that happening is Test, Track and Trace.How do you Test, Track and Trace an itinerant population of “let’s say”  to  tourists who move their location pretty much every day I think inviting an unrestricted number of visitors to the fragile Highland communities is a huge risk.Don’t think I don’t understand the economic consequences. My we and I run a very well-regarded BB taking people from all over the world.This year we will have none.Most BBs are not going to go bust, the owners are living in their own homes.Not so with hotels. So, we need a dferent answer anyway, because the chances are the hotels are not going to make up the number of bed-nights they need to survive in the next three or four months.Both the businesses and their staff need protection.Liquidators and Receivers should be instructed, by Government, to close the business downto stop the ebb of money, and either protect them from creditors, or much better pay the creditors with Government sponsored bank loans, keeping a close record of that expenditure. Perhaps they could also pay the staff They should mothball the business waiting for the day a vaccine or a cure is found, and it can re-open safely, and be handed back to the previous owners. The owners would then be given favourable, very long-term loans to pay back the costs met by the liquidators and receivers.There will be a cost, but a cost the owners can later meet, over many years, at low or virtually zero interest rates. The Government should not foot that bill, but it could facilitate it.I do not for one micro second forget the massive and fantastic contributions to health and care workers, and those on the front line who delivered to our doors at this time.However, my respect and admiration goes to the owners and staff of tourist and hospitality businesses.The financial and mental strains needing to remain optimistic, to remain as responsible employers and to face the financial crisis that this pandemic has brought, needs some recognition.I am sure the cost to trade and business may never truly be known, but must exceed millions of pounds.To those who kept us all safe, by cancelling visitors and closing shops, restaurants, hotels and tourist attractions at this testing time, simple words of thanks are not in any compensation for the vast loss in revenue from the sector.But I would just like to thank all those ethical and responsible businesses that did the right thing, and helping to decrease the possibility of the spread of this virus.The sacrices of owners and staff will not be forgotten, and I would urge all local people to rally round and support these businesses when it is safe to do so.Tourism and hospitality is the mainstay and leblood of our local economy, and with everyone#s help, in time it will recover.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/bbc-salisbury.jpg","title":"timely salisbury series showed ordinary people doing the best in an unprecedented","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineMy kids seemed to have survived this oversight in their upbringing although in high school it apparently caused some surprise among their pals.I should add it is not all books by candlelight. We do have movie nights in winter when we watch DVD’s and now Netflix through a data projector onto a large pull-down screen.It is almost a cinematic experience with the sound coming through my old-fashioned stereo and its big speakers on the wall.Very occasionally though I get to hear about a television drama that sparks an interest.Mostly they are forgotten asthey are any good, they are released on DVD or online as a mini-series, like Sherlock, produced by Skye’s own Douglas Mackinnon, and I can enjoy them at my leisure, glass and popcorn in hand while lying on a sofa.Last week however, I heard about the BBC drama The Salisbury Poisonings, an adaptation of the real events following the attempted murder of a former Russian spy in , and the ensuing public health danger.The series was timely.There was talk of tracking and tracing, areas were locked down, and there was a possible spread of an invisible deadly nerve agent.Containment was the key.Viewers now have an understanding and comprehension about much of the unfolding events, that they perhaps wouldn’t have had, were it screened four months earlier.Contamination through contact from surfaces such as light switches and work surfaces and Salisbury business owners complaining at a public meeting of a  per cent drop in trade due to the cordons in their streets.Much of what happened would strike a chord with many, as would the uncertainty of it all.I managed to watch the three episodes, albeit a few days after they were broadcast, and was struck how the story was a human one.It was about ordinary people doing the best they could in an unprecedented situation.It was seemingly very true to le. The screenplay was written after many interviews with the real players, who we meet briefly in a moving vignette at the end.The main protagonist was director of public health for the local authority Tracy Daszkiewicz.She found herself transported from doing the school run on the way to her perhaps ordinary council job, to making decisions in overflowing conference rooms with senior police officers, Porton Down chemical warfare experts and Whitehall representatives, the outcome of which could either prevent or mitigate the deaths of thousands of people.At times Daszkiewicz sits in her car with her head on the steering wheel, fighting back the tears and trying not to be overcome by the gravity of it all.Her agenda, quite simply was to protect the health of the people.As lockdown begins to be eased in Scotland, we know well enough that there is a balance between lives and livelihoods, health and the economy, mental and physical well-being, and consequence for the future.Decisions are being made daily as to how to ease the country back into a new normality in the most appropriate manner.These decisions are beginning to be politicised, and the old adversarial ways are beginning to rear their ugly heads in the chambers of our government.It is correct that decisions are scrutinised, and justication is asked for in public, but knee jerk criticism for political posturing is untimely, and often disingenuous.We are still very much in a public health crisis.The future is unknowable, and whatever path is taken, there will be negative consequences.It is not at all cut and dried or in any way unambiguous.Mark Twain popularised the quote “lies, damned lies and statistics”, but numbers are persuasive.If we are to believe the figures gleaned from the internet, England with  times the population has approximately  times the average daily new cases and hospital admissions, and  times the deaths.In England, the Westminster government is handling the crisis dferently, perhaps with a dferent agenda and a dferent emphasis on the balance between the health of the economy and the health of the population.Perhaps they have dferent priorities, but I have medic friends who are glad they live in Scotland, and worry how things might pan out south of the border.Lockdown couldn’t, and cannot last forever.The new normal must include commerce which must include tourism, but when I hear tourism representatives arguing for a reduction in the distance of social distances in order to protect jobs and businesses, I wonder, how many extra deaths should we allow in order to allow a pub to open.There are always dferent viewpoints and it takes real wisdom to be able to consider all perspectives.When the lobbyists and business sector leaders want relaxations to protect their interests, I hope they realise the bigger picture, and no decision which may preclude their ruin, would be taken lightly or flippantly.The collateral damage of closed down businesses I am sure will weigh heavily on the consciousness of our political leaders.I am reminded of a cartoon I have seen used in conflict resolution courses. Two people are looking at a number drawn on the floor from opposite angles, with the phrase “just because you are right doesn’t mean to say I am wrong”The number is of course a , or is it a  It is clear that the sliding and phasing of the opening of tourism and recreational facilities is to keep a slowly-slowly approach to prevent a flood of movement of people and the virus.They could have said folk with brown eyes are allowed out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, anything to stem a possible tide.An aspect of leadership is to be able to make dficult decisions, taking all criteria on board often in the face of criticism, trying to see the big picture in the face of uncertainty.A change of decision, a backtrack or U turn seems to be regarded as weakness by an opposition, although I have never understood why.Surely it shows strength of character to realise that a chosen path might not be the best, and that a dferent option might be better.There has been some discussion about female leaders acting dferently and perhaps more appropriately in the face of the current pandemic.I wonderSalisbury was lucky having a female director of health,the poisoning drama is to be believed. Tracy Daszkiewicz acted with incredible professionalism and complete integrity, with compassion and humanity.Political allegiances aside I believe that the same could be said of our own leader in Holyrood, a person doing an extraordinary job in an unprecedented situation.I wonderNicola Sturgeon sometimes stops her car puts her head on the steering wheel and weeps at the gravity of it all.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hope-and-faith-scaled.jpg","title":"skye youngsters clock up more than 10000 miles for zambian school","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe Portree High students were challenged to clock up the miles and between them run or walk the distance between Skye and Lusaka, Zambia – home of the Hope and Faith Community School.Over the last two months pupils and teachers have completed , miles, easily surpassing their original ,-mile target.Now the youngsters have been challenged to add a further , miles before the term ends, and to add to the £ that has been brought in for the project.A donation of £ will pay for school meals for all pupils at the school, which has long established links to Skye.The school began in  with two pupils, but has since grown to help provide education – and a daily meal – for over  children on the outskirts of the Zambian capital..There have been exchange visits between the schools, and Portree teachers Neil Burrows and Tony Breen had been due to head to Africa at Easter, with two Zambian teachers ing to Skye in May.It is now hoped the exchange can go ahead in .Mr Breen, Portree’s deputy head, said the challenge had been a positive one – both for the charity and for the health and well-being of the pupils during lockdown.He added: “We are very pleased with the balance of work and wellbeing for the majority of our pupils.“Looking at our provision of online learning in comparison with the rest of Scotland, most parents have been happy with the dferent ways in which pupils have been learning # from watching teachers pre-made videos, google meets and chats, online quizzes, and even DIY science practicals.”.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions.

With the Game of Thrones connection nearby, we#ve had people make a detour to go by the church and get a photograph.The tree was a runner-up in the Woodland Trust Tree of the Year awards in .They did look at the history at the time and said it was entirely plausible that the legend could in fact be true.Everyone in the parish has always been very fond of it and we#ve already been inundated with offers from people to make sure the tree lives on in some form. We will certainly be trying to do something like that, but the first priority is to make the area safe.It was in late May  when a fleet of  ships set sail from Spain to invade England, King Phillip II#s aim to overthrow Queen Elizabeth I and halt the rise of Protestantism.The story goes that gales had blown his ship hundreds of miles off course before it was wrecked off the coast of Northern Ireland. The sailor#s body washed up on the shores of Ballygally Bay in , where locals discovered the corpse and buried it in an unmarked grave at St Patrick#s Church.But his grave didn#t remain unmarked for long. A sapling sprouted and went on to stand there for over  years.It#s quite a tale and one which the locals around here love to tell, said Rev Benson.We#d be hopeful of finding out more about the history of it now it#s fallen.We could see on CCTV that the tree fell about half five in the morning. It was very calm so there was no storm damage as such.It#s now resting across some gravestones so we need to be careful about moving it.We had a tree surgeon come up and look at it and apparently the roots had gone. Unfortunately that#s it. It would have happened sooner or later and we#re thankful it happened when it did, with no-one around. It was just the weight of the tree that finally brought it over.But there#s no way we want to turn it into firewood, we#re much too fond of it for that.Once we examine the condition of the wood we#ll be looking into doing something with it. The trunk itself is quite a size and we want to use it to create something substantial for local people to remember it by. It deserves to be preserved.Rev Benson is now hopeful that a study of the site might bring some answers as to whether there#s any truth in the legend.There#s interest from an archaeologist who will be coming down to have a look and seethere#s anything underneath where the tree stood, said Rev Benson.Now that the tree is down we can let experts take a really good look at it, date it properly and seeindeed it did grow from the chestnuts in the pocket of a Spanish Armada sailor who may still lie beneath it.In the meantime, Rev Benson has urged people not to come along to the graveyard to salvage a piece of history. The graveyard is covered by CCTV and numerous people have already ignored the tape around the fallen tree to take wood and cuttings.We cannot stress enough that the tree is not safe, he added.We don#t want to close the graveyard, butpeople continue to ignore the warnings, that is unfortunately the action we will have to take. Anyone ignoring the tape is personally liable for any further damage to yourself or the gravestones, so please be careful.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe#s heartbroken mum always told her #special# son he would change the world Pictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah DonohoeLoyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdownNoah always in our hearts: Tragic end to mystery which has haunted country all week as teen found in Belfast drain complexDouble le of Christian rock pervert Hobson ...

I realised it had to be his.Ms Crooks, who attended the north Belfast vigils for Noah on Sunday, immediately called the police at pm. A neighbour#s CCTV would later show Noah walking around the back of the Northwood Road, where there is access to a storm drain, which may or may not have been locked.They realised this must have been where Noah was last seen alive, she said.I#d obviously started a chain of events because then they were then able to find his clothes and helmet.Then the search and rescue teams appeared. They were here most of the night searching the area around my house, trying to work out where he went next.As a child who grew up here, I was asking myself #where would I have gone  What would I have done#  I just couldn#t work it out.She also revealed that she became very emotional when police officers called to collect Noah#s bicycle.When they took the bike away on Tuesday afternoon, I burst into tears, she said.I#ve had to take comfort from the fact that me coming across that bike brought the rescue team here to start the search. If I hadn#t brought them here, to this storm drain and this river, maybe they would never have found him.Ms Crooks, a classroom assistant, said she didn#t need to watch any of the news reports because she watched the search unfold in my front garden, my street and in my community.She also told how she met Noah#s aunt Niamh in her back garden and she said they would always be welcome at her home, should they wish to visit.Niamh and others came down to help in the search at one point and had made their own sandwiches, she said. Pastor Brian Madden, who was comforting the family, said #put those sandwiches away, we have got hot food for you, and tea and coffee#. As Brian later said, they didn#t want to encroach on anyone#s generosity.Ms Crooks said that, as a mother of two young boys, she could only imagine how Noah#s mother must be feeling at the loss of her son.You just believe your children are always going to be there with you, she said.Unfortunately that#s now not the case for Fiona. How she#s going to get over this, I just don#t know. I#m heartbroken for her and her family.It is still not known why Noah entered the drain, but police have said they do not believe there was any foul play.The funeral will take place at St Patrick#s Church in north Belfast at am on Wednesday.On Monday the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Frank McCoubrey, opened an online book of condolence in memory of Noah.He said: People from across the city have been deeply affected by the loss of young Noah, and their thoughts and prayers are with Noah#s mother and wider family circle at this devastating time.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland bfa .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cba-ba-a-d-abea_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandPrivate funeral to be held for schoolboy Noah Donohoe A private funeral will be held for tragic schoolboy Noah Donohoe on Wednesday, his family has announced.

She added it was a hugely emotional day for all.Adam and Aoe have been through so much pain and are still dealing with a lot, she said.They are on a journey, like I am. The likes of a small card means so much to them andit makes them happy and gives them a smile on their face then my job is done.Bronaghwas left heartbroken after her husband collapsed at their Culmore home on April  after ing from a cycle ride. Despite her frantic attempts to save him Thomas, a keep-fit enthusiast, passed away.At the start of this month Bronagh asked people to send her children a card for their fourth birthday. Not only did Adam and Aoe receive an abundance of them, Republic of Ireland footballer James McClean bought them tickets to Disneyland Paris and YouTuber Adam B presented Bronagh with a new car.Yesterday the Burke house was filled with balloons, cupcakes and bunting and their garden had a huge bouncy castle for the children to play on. Meanwhile, they set about reading the many birthday cards from around the world.We got ,. We opened some of them yesterday and this morning, said Bronagh. They are from as far away as Australia, Spain, Italy and China, but we are not even a quarter of the way through them. One German woman sent us two absolutely beautul cushions with Thomas and the twins on them. We started off this morning with a good cry as we watched a video I had made that had our wedding footage in it and some of our journey. We opened some more cards and the rest of the day has been just hectic.We went through excruciating pain and still are. We are going through a lot of trauma. I just wanted to make Adam and Aoe#s birthday so special this year as it was going to be the first without their daddy.Bronagh said she never expected to receive so much goodwill from the public. She added: A friend reached out to me a few weeks back with a plan to get as many birthday cards as we could for them. We put out the appeal. Within two days we got our first  cards and it#s just been hundreds and hundreds of cards since. We started this on June  and this morning - within just  days - we had , cards to open.Bronagh says she has been overwhelmed with the support. Last week Adam B gave the twins a whole host of birthday gts and presented a shocked and surprised Bronagh with the car. I was absolutely buzzing. I was speechless when he gave it to me, I think I still am, to be honest, she added.Another startling gt for the twins was from Derry man McClean and his we Erin, who had organised the trip to Disneyland Paris.That was amazing. James reached out to me a few weeks ago and said to me about Disneyland, she explained.I couldn#t believe it. I was floored and I couldn#t wait to say to the twins, but I left it until their birthday. Adam and Aoe are absolutely over the Moon, they have never been to Disneyland before. We are so very delighted. James and Adam B are both true gentlemen and I could never thank them enough.Bronagh said the twins# birthday was an emotional day.She added: It has been all go since am this morning. We#ve had so many parcels and presents and balloons, cupcakes and everything. The whole of Derry just came together and me, Adam and Aoe didn#t have to do anything. Everybody came together and looked after us in our darkest times. It has been powerful. It has lted me so much. It has eased me a lot.Bronagh said she thinks her husband would be so pleased, adding: I think #Burkey# would be beyond proud. I think he would be so honoured the way Derry and people throughout the world have acknowledged them.

Dalradian has since undertaken not to use it, but opposition continues.Announcing the public inquiry, Ms Mallon acknowledged it was a complex project.She said: The planning application for the Dalradian gold mine project at Greencastle, Co Tyrone, was submitted to the department in November . Revised proposals including the complete removal of cyanide from any part of the application process were received in September .The application has proved to be complex and in excess of , representations have now been submitted to my department about the mine proposal. The planning application includes an assessment of the potential socio-economic and environmental impacts by a wide range of expert consultees. Before any decision is taken I consider it important to have a public inquiry and report which has independently considered the views of stakeholders, including the local community and other government departments, and which will robustly scrutinise the information provided by all interested parties. Once I am satisfied that all necessary detail and consultee responses have been provided I will move to call the public inquiry to allow for robust scrutiny of the application in a public forum.Dalradian said Ms Mallon#s announcement was an important step.We welcome the news that the Infrastructure Minister plans to call a public inquiry into our planning application for an underground gold, silver and copper mine in Co Tyrone. We believe this is a key milestone in the planning process of a regionally signicant project which will be a major economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, it said. The inquiry will provide a further forum in which to engage on the facts of the project and to hear from all stakeholders. To date, we have engaged in almost  meetings with the regulatory authorities to ensure that we have designed a world class operation to meet and exceed environmental regulations.Dalradian said the project will see the creation of around , direct and indirect jobs during the mine#s  to -year le. The company added: To date, we have invested over £m in Northern Ireland since  and believe our project supports rural communities and regional development and is a commitment that will be delivered regardless of Brexit. The construction phase alone will generate  jobs with a capital spend of £ million and will leverage the skills and experience of local building contractors.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe#s heartbroken mum always told her #special# son he would change the world Pictured: The man due in court over sick video about Noah DonohoeLoyalist band parade to go ahead despite warning it will breach lockdownNoah always in our hearts: Tragic end to mystery which has haunted country all week as teen found in Belfast drain complexCoronavirus Northern Ireland updates: Groups of up to  people allowed to meet outdoors, Foster announces,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Wilson James took over the airport#s security services on November  and it#s now thought they are planning for  redundancies among the airport#s security staff. Unite the Union, which represents the workers affected, has said the move is unnecessary and said the jobs affected could remain on furlough. They also called for an aviation rescue strategy to safeguard future of both Belfast airports.Regional officer for Unite George Brash said: Unite has received a HR notication from Wilson James for proposals to make redundant  workers at Belfast International Airport. Three quarters of this workforce are currently furloughed under the government’s Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme and there is absolutely no need to push them onto dole queues and their families onto bread lines in the midst of a pandemic.The workers affected have been left reeling as they had rightfully assumed that their status would be protected through the furlough scheme until the airport recovered its footfall.Mr Brash raised concerns about the future of jobs in Belfast airports and called for politicians to safeguard the future of regional transportation hubs. We call on Stormont political leaders to bring forward an Aviation Rescue strategy – Northern Ireland and these workers deserve better than continued inaction.In response to this announcement, Unite will continue to engage with management at Wilson James to attempt to reduce job losses and to obtain the best possible outcome for our members.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for St. Columb’s College encouraged people to get involved today. “Both of these young men are sadly missed by staff and students at the College. “Oran was a pleasant young man - a true gentleman in the making. He was a conscientious student who was respected by staff and peers alike. Outside of school, he played an active role in his local GAA club and enjoyed socialising with friends when not working on cars with his father. googletag.cmd.push “Oran showed extreme courage and faith throughout his illness and his loss has left its mark on those who remember him fondly. “Aodhaacuten was such a genuine, lovely person and brought a smile to everyone he was around. He was a dream of a young fella. He was a fantastic hurler and loved representing his club and county. Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Public services will be held in many local churches today for the first time in months. There will be many restrictions in place to protect worshippers from possible coronavirus infection. Catholic Bishop of Derry, Doanl McKeown, welcomed the resumption of services but urged people to take care. “I hope that we have learned lessons about le since we were locked down in March,” he said. “This is a time to cherish those lessons and not to allow the insights to be lost in a tsunami of going back to the future. googletag.cmd.push “We have seen what has happened in those places where there has been a stampede to forget we escaped from worse consequences through self-discipline. “It will take many people time to overcome the fear of mixing again. “We want our churches to be places where people can share the infectious good news of the Gospel – but avoid being Corona-infected through selfishness and carelessness. “We have to begin cautiously. “In all areas of human le, short term gain can lead to long-term pain.” The Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Rev Andrew Forster, has also appealed to parishioners to be patient and understanding as their churches get ready for the resumption of public worship. googletag.cmd.push “Although in Ireland, at the moment, the virus seems very much under control – which we’re so thankful for – we know the virus is still there,” Bishop Andrew said. “We’ve been given the freedom to meet again [from Monday], but we know that with freedom comes responsibility. “At the moment, going back to church places a lot of responsibility on you and on me, on select vestries and on clergy, and on all those who will attend churches because we’ve got to follow all the public health guidelines and we’ve got to follow the guidelines that the Church of Ireland has put together for that. “I really welcome the opportunity to be back at church but I want you to know that there’s no set date by which this may happen, because select vestries – and clergy in particular – have to make sure that in their parishes it’s right and it’s appropriate and it’s safe to open, and that’ll take time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Expressing his sadness at the heart-breaking news that the body of the -year-old Belfast schoolboy was found by PSNI on Saturday following a six-day search for the missing teenager, Mayor Tierney said felt it was important the public had an opportunity to show support for the Donohue family. He said: “I was totally devastated when I heard Noah’s body had been found. googletag.cmd.push I think all of us were really hopeful that he would be found andhome safe to his family. For a young boy to go out on his bike on a Sunday afternoon and never come home is just heartbreaking. As a parent I don’t even want to contemplate the pain and loss the Donohue family are feeling and my heart goes out to his Mammy and his extended family circle as they try to come to terms with their incredible loss. As Mayor, I want to extend sincere condolences on behalf of the people of Derry and Strabane and reassure the family that our thoughts and prayers are with them at this very dficult time. It is truly heartbreaking.” googletag.cmd.push The Mayor added that all support should now be focused on helping the Donohue family in whatever way the community can at this imaginably dficult time. “By signing the online Book of Condolence you can provide some words of comfort and support to Noah’s family,” he added. The book is available for signing from today via the following link -https:www.derrystrabane Book-of-Condolences-for-Noah-Donohue​    If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Among their concerns werethe destructionof ancient woodland and mature trees and the suggestion that the buildingis out of character and proportion with theexisting neighbouring properties. The report said thatthe building went ahead it would have adversely affected thecharacterandenvironmental quality of theof thesurrounding area through the loss of an important and well establishedurban woodland greenspace.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work. Itrsquos not workyou love what you do, he said..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Developers asked to show interest in Irish Street site  ","story":"DEVELOPERS will shortly be asked to submit expressions of interest in transforming a major site in the heart of Downpatrick to help bolster the townrsquos economic recovery.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are driving ambitious plans to redevelop a near two acre site encompassing the former Irish Street police station, a number of adjacent empty buildings and the local authority-owned car park.While it was feared that the coronavirus pandemic could delay plans to redevelop of the huge site, work has continued on the project with a new brochure produced to provide would-be developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquos potential and secure expressions of interest.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the public virtually.Described as a ldquostrategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential and are working towards drawing up a development brief.While the former police base enjoys protected status, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come up with an imaginative plan for the historic building and that a preferred bidder will be appointed as early as October and as late as the end of the year.The council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.Council officials say that the Irish Street project is vital to the recovery of the local economy, improving the wellbeing of the community and a welcome confidence boost for the construction sector.In addition, they insist that theyrsquore committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the site and want to hear their feedback on the way forward.The steering group set up to oversee the Downpatrick scheme held a recent progress meeting and council chairwoman Laura Devlin said she was delighted with the projectrsquos momentum.She confirmed that councillors and local authority officials have been working with the Department for Communities and local stakeholders to develop an lsquoonline engagement processrsquo.She explained this is designed to inform the preferred end uses for the Irish Street site and allow key stakeholders to have input into the development brief which is critical to the success of the project.ldquoWhile the Downpatrick regeneration scheme is in the early developmental stages, it will also stimulate signicant investment for the local economy, she added.John Armstrong, from the Construction Employers Federation, said the scheme and a number of others the council is planning for the Newry area, will provide a boost for the local construction sector.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the progress being made on redeveloping he site.Mr Hazzard described the regeneration project as a ldquounique and exciting opportunity, one which has the potential to unlock much-needed economic and social opportunity for the town centre and wider community.ldquoThis regeneration project must act as a catalyst for the long overdue expansion of the townrsquos evening and weekend economy its new heartbeat in some respects, he continued.ldquoGiven the sitersquos close proximity to nearby homes, the project must also be viewed as more than a commercial development. It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents. The proposal has the potential to add a new vibrancy with local people helping shape how this key site will be transformed.Cllr Hanlon said she was pleased that the next stage of the sitersquos redevelopment is ready for launch, allowing potential developers and interested parties an opportunity to view the site online, with feedback from the local community welcomed.ldquoPeople will be able to give their views on the potential for the site and the likely constraints within any proposed project, she explained. ldquoAny feedback would be used to assist both the council and Department for Communities to prepare a development brief for the site.Cllr Hanlon added: ldquoThe project to redevelop the former police base and surrounding area provides an opportunity to reinvigorate the Downpatrick town centre. This is the opportunity of a generation to restore a vibrant town centre and will build on the ongoing regeneration of the Irish Street area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing plans to catch owners over dog fouling  ","story":"DOG owners who fail to clean up after their pets could soon find themselves in court after local politicians agreed to investigate the potential of using DNA testing to catch offenders.Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers have been instructed to examine the merits of testing dog dirt in a bid to trace animals whose owners allow them to use public areas as open air toilets.Under the scheme, a sample of dog dirt would be taken for analysis to trace the identity of the animal, with the owner being subsequently prosecuted.Agreement for officers to research the DNA issue was given at last weekrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee following a proposal tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines, suggesting that council officers draw upon best practice from other organisations who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.Council officials say they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme before compiling a report on its potential implementation.Cllr Billy Walker has welcomed the decision to investigate the DNA issue and says he cannot understand why dog owners to do not clean up after their pets.He said that the problem was district-wide and hoped that offenders will end up being prosecuted.ldquoI am an advocate of naming and shaming people on this particular issue but it is not a road which the council has been keen to go down. However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way.

For this we give thanks to God,” said Rev McDowell.“During the months of lockdown, some of you will have had hellish experiences as you have suffered the death of someone very close to you, or have endured the desolating tedium and stress of isolation. For these very reasons, you may welcome the freedom to worship but be worried or apprehensive about ing.

And being true to him means always thinking of others as we join together in corporate worship and in everyday le. To have made the necessary preparations to make church safe and to keep it safe. To take the necessary precautions as we begin to mix again in society, in shops, in restaurants and other public spaces. That is the impulse of the law of love and solidarity which is our vocation. “Each of us will begin to emerge from lockdown changed in some ways.

They were beautul photographs of a beautul boy. A boy with an entire le ahead of him. I happened to have a copy of Dr Seuss’s Oh, The Places You’ll Go! beside meand was immediately drawn to these lines:You have brains in your head.You have feet in your shoes.Floral tributes left for Noah Donohoe on the gates of his school, St Malachy’s College \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...You can steer yourselfany direction you choose.You’re on your own. And you know what you know.And YOU are the guy who’ll decide where to go.Noah will never have the chance to live those lines.Even though I know that over , young people between the ages of  and  are reported missing every year in Northern Ireland I consoled myself that the overwhelming majority, more than %, are found within two days . Yet every one of those hours is like a letime for those waiting at home.And even though I had never heard of Noah before last Monday I found myself checking news sites every couple of hours to seehe had turned up safe and well. Judging by the traction on social media it was clear that hundreds of thousands of others were doing exactly the same thing.Isn’t it extraordinary that with so much  going on right now – particularly with the pandemic and fears of another wave – so many us were thinking about Noah  It’s that concern, compassion and sheer hope of a good outcome that really touched me. Hundreds of people out looking for him. Tens of thousands tweeting and retweeting his photograph. Who knows how many parents giving their own children an extra hug or how many older children thinking for the first time that this could have been their own friend or sibling. The very palpable sense of collective grief when the news came through that a body had been found.I couldn’t understand why I was so deeply moved. So gut-wrenchingly upset. I didn’t know Noah. I don’t know his mum or any member of his family. I don’t know anyone that knew him. And yet I was still wiping my eyes on Saturday morning. Looking at my own childrenand wondering how I would cope – how I would even begin to cope –I knew I would never see one of them again. Looking again at his photograph was an almost unbearable experience: yet I owed him that look. I owed him those moments of reflection because he has touched my le and my emotions.I think Gail Walker summed up brilliantly the collective feeling: ‘The ceaseless rain in Belfast tonight seems apt a sad city mourning a fine, handsome and brilliant boy. Let’s draw a scrap of comfort from how even in our petty isions we came together to search without flagging how in the face of senseless tragedy we mourn as one.’ Gail is right: caring about the whereabouts and safety of a boy unknown to almost all of us tells us something about ourselves.On his way to and from school, or just getting on with his everyday le, hundreds, maybe thousands of us will have seen him without noticing him. Just another teenage boy. Today he is remembered as a very specic teenage boy. A teenage boy getting on with his everyday le last Sunday: but who never came home again. And there isn’t a mum or dad in Northern Ireland who doesn’t want to go and give his mum a hug right now. There is nothing worse than the loss of a child. We have lost four through miscarriage and there is rarely a day when we don’t think about them. The smallest thing can bring them to mind. There is a song which still reduces me to tears because it’s what we played when we cremated our miscarried -week-old son, Conan. That sort of grief is crippling but, to be perfectly frank, I’m pretty sure it couldn’t even begin to compare with the grief of losing a child you have loved and looked after for  years.I think that’s why the story of a missing child will always dominate headlines: nearly all of us are parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles or friends. We know how the loss would hit us. And while few of us could put ourselves in the shoes of those who have lost a child, there’s not one of us isn’t aware of the hammer-blow such a loss would be. My -year-old, Lilah, walked into the room just as I wrote that line. I felt a welling in my eyes. I can’t imagine le without her. I’ll finish with Tom Krause’s poem about the death of his son, Fingerprints:Your fingerprints are on my heart.Fingerprints that teach me about caring.Fingerprints that teach me about love.Fingerprints that teach me about courage.Fingerprints that teach me about hope.Fingerprints that bring me closer to my loved ones.Fingerprints that bring me closer to myself.In the time I cared for you my whole le changed – never to be the same again.All this from tiny fingerprints that touch my heart.You will live in my heart forever – never to be forgotten.I will always love you.You are my child.I think some of Noah’s fingerprints are on us right now. He has managed to touch us all. And in a world which is too often cold, brutal and cynical it’s actually heartening to know how much the le of one boy can bring us together.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s nice that we can copy and paste the plan but it was a little but annoying that it had worked but then we couldn’t show everyone what we had been working towards.“I don’t mind repeating it all, some people might find that boring but I know it’s going to work.“Our season will start back in August and hopefully by that stage the new normal will be around.”Despite the frustrations, Danielle said she thinks Northern Ireland have done lockdown “the right way”, adding: “no sport is bigger than a worldwide pandemic”.Her usual swimming bases include Belfast Royal Academy , Larne Leisure Centre and the m pool at Bangor Aurora.“Once lock down was eased and up to ten were allowed to gather we were able to come to an arrangement to use the BRA pool for an hour,” she said.“We had two-and-a-half months off so an hour was probably enough for that first week fitness wise and getting a feel for the water again.”With swimming pools in the Irish Republic reopening weeks ago, Danielle was able to use the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin, but said as a non funded athlete she could not afford to travel there every day.She compared the experience to when she suffered a recent elbow injury two years ago and felt like she had had to learn to swim all over again.“Whenever I got back into the water then, I had to learn how to swim again because I couldn’t even straighten my arm at one stage, so I count myself very lucky this time I can just get in and swim,” she said.“But it felt weird, I felt like a eel swimming through the water, there was no feeling there at all.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females.

confirmed its camping facilitieswill reopen at three sites in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\"
