Photograph: Colm LenaghanPacemaker PressTalks aimed at restoring the North’s power-sharing institutions get under way at Stormont House near Belfast today, with senior Government figures in Dublin hoping the first phase of talks this week will build trust between the parties.Irish and British government officials have been finalising plans for the talks in a series of contacts over the weekend, while Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and Northern Secretary Karen Bradley spoke yesterday.The timetable and structure of the talks will be presented to the five Northern Irish parties this morning, but senior figures in Dublin say they hope the initial phase can be used to establish trust between the two biggest parties that will dominate the talks, the DUP and Sinn Féin. The UUP, SDLP and Alliance are also involved.Senior sources confess they are hopeful rather than optimistic of a breakthrough over the coming weeks, and say it will be necessary for the two largest parties to demonstrate they want to make a revived Stormont work.Officials in the two governments have mapped out a path to progress in the talks, but sources say the sequencing of various issues will remain flexible in order to allow the governments to pace the most difficult issues.Ultimately, sources say any agreement is likely to be along the lines of the deal between the two parties abandoned last year, when the DUP membership objected to a stand-alone Irish-language Act that would have recognised in law the rights of Irish speakers in the North.The issue is a must-have for Sinn Féin, but the DUP is likely to insist that any legal changes are not too intrusive for its membership to accept.Sinn Féin will seek a route to the legalisation of same-sex marriage and the liberalisation of abortion law in the North. In return the DUP will look for guarantees that Sinn Féin will not collapse the executive again in the event of political difficulties.Sinn Féin walked out in January of 2017 when the late Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister, citing concerns over a scheme to subsidise renewable energy.Round-table meetingEvents will begin at Stormont House this morning when Mr Coveney and Ms Bradley will meet to discuss their joint approach this morning, before chairing a round-table meeting involving negotiating teams from the five parties. The two governments hope progress can be made relatively quickly and a deal to revive the Stormont institutions can be agreed within three weeks.However, one Dublin official struck a note of caution about expectations last night, pointing out that the results of the local elections in the North – where both the DUP and Sinn Féin held their leading positions – did not show that voters in the North were punishing them for the absence of the powersharing administration.Meanwhile, in an effort to improve the atmosphere before the talks, Ms Bradley has announced a £105 million investment package for the Derry region.In a statement issued by the Northern Ireland Office, Ms Bradley said: “This £105 million investment package is a major boost to the economic potential of the region and will help strengthen the foundations for greater prosperity and a stronger, more united society.Mr Coveney will also travel to London with Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan on Monday to meet British ministers at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3882787.1557171337!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"which investigation finds incorrect information given to air travellers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNot only did Ryanair get two-thirds of the questions wrong, one staff member was unable to explain what a package holiday was. Photograph: Paul HannaReutersSome leading travel companies and airlines operating in Ireland do not fully understand the rights their customers have, according to a Which? investigation published this morning.The consumer group found some of the biggest travel operators doing business in the Republic are giving incorrect information about the level of cover and protections travellers are entitled to under EU regulations.Posing as potential customers, Which? contacted Expedia, Ryanair, Edreams, Lastminute, Trailfinders and TravelRepublic with a series of questions about the level of protection which could be expected with holidays they advertise.But Which? found many of the staff that it spoke to could not correctly answer more than half of the questions asked.StruggledIt said that Ryanair and Edreams agents struggled the most with both firms giving more wrong answers than right ones, getting 10 out of 15 questions wrong.Not only did Ryanair get two-thirds of the questions wrong, one staff member was unable to explain what a package holiday was – claiming that because the “hotel was provided by a third party it doesn’t count as a package”.The “third party” hotel was booked via Ryanair Rooms, and the flight and hotel were part of the same transaction.When asked about Linked Travel Arrangements rules staff at six of the seven travel companies got this question incorrect every single time Which? asked it.The investigation did reveal that with the right training, companies can get the advice right with TrailFinders only getting one question wrong.The consumer group’s travel editor Rory Boland said while the rules around travel protection could be difficult to understand, “that is no excuse for travel agents who are in the business of selling holidays to give travellers the wrong information”.He said it was “completely unreasonable” for the responsibility to rest with holidaymakers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881599.1557055813!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"let s do a deal theresa may urges labour to agree on brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Theresa May leaves church in Sonning. Photograph: Simon DawsonReutersBritish prime minister Theresa May on Sunday stepped up calls for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a cross-party deal to leave the European Union, following poor results for both parties in local elections on Thursday.The parties have been in negotiations for over a month to try to broker a Brexit deal that can secure majority support in parliament, after Mrs May’s minority government suffered three heavy defeats on her preferred deal this year and was forced to delay Britain’s departure.“To the leader of the opposition I say this: Let’s listen to what the voters said in the local elections and put our differences aside for a moment. Let’s do a deal,” she wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.Labour responded by saying any deal should be done quickly, but accused Mrs May of leaking details of the compromise under discussion and jeopardising the talks.Mrs May’s Conservatives lost more than a thousand seats on English local councils that were up for re-election, and Labour - which would typically aim to gain hundreds of seats in a mid-term vote - lost 81.The talks with Labour are a last resort for Mrs May, whose party’s deep isions over Brexit have so far stopped her getting approval for an exit agreement and left the world’s fifth largest economy in prolonged political limbo.The Sunday Times reported that the Conservatives would offer new concessions to Labour when talks restart on Tuesday, including a temporary customs union with the EU until a general election due in June 2022.“At that point Labour could use their manifesto to argue for a softer Brexit if they wanted to and a new Conservative prime minister could argue for a harder Brexit,” a source cited by the Sunday Times said.Mr Corbyn has made a permanent customs union with the EU a condition for supporting Mrs May’s Brexit plans, while most Conservatives oppose a customs union as it would stop Britain from reaching its own trade deals with other countries.AngerThe report on the terms of a possible compromise angered MrCorbyn’s senior ally John McDonnell, who oversees the party’s finance policy and has been involved in the Brexit talks.Asked if he trusted Mrs May, Mr McDonnell said: “No, sorry. Not after this weekend when she’s blown the confidentiality... I actually think she’s jeopardised the negotiations for her own personal protection.”Nevertheless, McDonnell said talks would continue this week and if a deal could still be struck, it must be concluded quickly.Even then, the parliamentary approval - required by law - is not straightforward.A customs union would upset the most pro-Brexit members of the Conservative Party who say it does not honour the terms of the country’s 2016 vote to leave the EU.Eurosceptic MP John Redwood tweeted on Sunday that a cross-party agreement that amounted to staying in the bloc was “the last thing we need.”On the other side of the Brexit ide, the Observer newspaper reported that scores of Labour MPs had written to Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to insist on a second Brexit referendum on any deal agreed.Veteran Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, whose new Brexit Party is predicted to make big gains in European Parliament elections this month, said a Conservative-Labour Brexit deal on a customs union would be “a coalition of politicians against the people.”A temporary customs union would also be likely to raise EU concerns that it could lead to customs checks on the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland if it later breaks down - something Ireland objects to strongly. - ReutersDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignRoyal baby boy: weighing 7lb 3oz and born at 5.26am - here\u0026#39s everything we know about Harry and Meghan’s first child‘To shoot an elephant is an awesome thing to do’ says trophy hunter, as Michael Gove admits he is \u0026#39cautious\u0026#39 over banning imported animal partsRoyal baby latest news: Prince Harry says birth of son is \u0026#39the most amazing experience\u0026#39 as world waits for first sightingBBC correspondent Nicholas Witchell lost for words during royal report as colleagues lend supportHow the Sussexes are determined to carve their own royal path as details of birth remain shrouded in secrecyTwo teenagers left fighting for their lives after \u0026#39linked\u0026#39 stabbingsPrince Charles to celebrate Royal Family\u0026#39s German heritage in major speech on \u0026#39Brexit tour\u0026#39Private jet travelling from Las Vegas crashes in Mexico, killing all on boardTory MPs \u0026#39will move to oust Theresa May this week\u0026#39 if she agrees Brexit deal with LabourCost of staging European elections rockets by £50mBritish Isil member who lost arm and breast in Syria drone strike must be helped back to UK, say relativesComment: Mrs Thatcher would agree that we need America now more than ever Turkey election body orders Istanbul vote re-run after president\u0026#39s party complains about resultRoyal Baby Sussex: Harry\u0026#39s reaction was unbuttoned, excited and gloriously himself.

Unions say management came up with this system to accelerate change at the company as it faced increasingly open competition since the state removed its controlling stake.Two years later, with the telecoms market in full upheaval and France’s state sector workers virtually unsackable, Mr Lombard unveiled a management plan that made no bones about wanting to strong-arm 22,000 employees to leave within three years. Managers should do everything possible to push them to do so through the window or the door, he told them.Didier Lombard, ex-CEO of France Telecom denies fostering institutional harassment at the companyThe aim, said prosecutors, was to demoralise staff in any way they saw fit in order to get them to throw in the towel. This could be sending them to far-flung places away from their families, obliging a mother to travel two hours to work each day, or forgetting staff during an office move leaving them in the former premises for weeks without an office, desk or chair and far from ex-colleagues. In their indictment, investigating magistrates said employees faced “multiple and disorderly organisational changes, repeated calls to to leave, forced mobility, an excess or absence of work, the attribution of demeaning missions, non-existent or insufficient training and…isolation”.The strategy worked but unions and management now concur that in the space of a year from 2008-9, some 35 employees had taken their own life in the process.One stabbed himself during a meeting, another left a suicide note saying he couldn\u0027t take the strain of management through terror”. Two months later, a 32-year-old woman killed herself in her Paris office as horrified colleagues looked on. Thousands more left the company appalled at their treatment.When asked to explain the rash of suicides, Mr Lombard prompted widespread outrage by dismissing them as a “fad”. He later apologised for “the enormous gaffe” and stepped down in 2010.During the nine-year investigation, magistrates focused on the cases of 39 employees, 19 of whom killed themselves, 12 who tried to commit suicide and eight who suffered from acute depression or were signed off sick as a result of it.French unions hope the trial of France Telecom and its ex-boss serve as a trial against \u0026#39social violence as a method of management\u0026#39.During questioning, the top executives denied any concrete targets to cut staff saying these were mere guidelines and they were doing what they could to save the company at a difficult time.  After buying Orange at the height of the telecoms boom in 2000, France Telecom\u0027s €70bn (£60bn) deficit matched Russia\u0027s Soviet-era foreign debt. Major re-structuring helped halve that figure within a decade.But after poring over documents and interviewing witnesses, prosecutors said that managers had been trained to demoralise their teams and their bonuses were dependent on this”.The moral harassment was organised at the corporate level by its executives, said investigating judges.Mr Lombard, his number two Louis-Pierre Wenes and human resources director Olivier Barberot face a maximum year in prison and €15,000 fine. Four other executives face charges of complicity. The company faces a €75,000 fine.The defendants deny all charges.Raphaël Louvradoux, 56, whose father committed suicide in April 2011 by setting fire to himself outside a company site, said he regretted judges had not retained the more serious charges of “manslaughter” and “endangering the lives of others”. “Their mass plan was aimed at pushing people over the edge. They knew it could kill,” he said.The two-month trial could see as many as 100 civil plaintiffs with many calling for it to serve as a landmark case against managerial brutality.Sebastien Crozier, head of the CFE-CGC labour union at Orange, said the trial was about the use of social violence as a method of management.It comes at a time of soul-searching in France about suicides in other sectors, in particular among police and farmers.Royal baby boy: weighing 7lb 3oz and born at 5.26am - here\u0026#39s everything we know about Harry and Meghan’s first child‘To shoot an elephant is an awesome thing to do’ says trophy hunter, as Michael Gove admits he is \u0026#39cautious\u0026#39 over banning imported animal partsRoyal baby latest news: Prince Harry says birth of son is \u0026#39the most amazing experience\u0026#39 as world waits for first sightingBBC correspondent Nicholas Witchell lost for words during royal report as colleagues lend supportHow the Sussexes are determined to carve their own royal path as details of birth remain shrouded in secrecyTwo teenagers left fighting for their lives after \u0026#39linked\u0026#39 stabbingsPrince Charles to celebrate Royal Family\u0026#39s German heritage in major speech on \u0026#39Brexit tour\u0026#39Private jet travelling from Las Vegas crashes in Mexico, killing all on boardTory MPs \u0026#39will move to oust Theresa May this week\u0026#39 if she agrees Brexit deal with LabourCost of staging European elections rockets by £50mBritish Isil member who lost arm and breast in Syria drone strike must be helped back to UK, say relativesComment: Mrs Thatcher would agree that we need America now more than ever Turkey election body orders Istanbul vote re-run after president\u0026#39s party complains about resultRoyal Baby Sussex: Harry\u0026#39s reaction was unbuttoned, excited and gloriously himself.

Show all 22Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years.

Even though he’s emotionally resolved...\u0026nbspWe fix his problem, and it’s not his weight,” Markus said.“I know some people are sensitive about some of the humour that comes from it, which I understand. But our issue that we wanted him to deal with was his emotional state that his mum addresses. And I think he is the ideal Thor at the end of the movie, and he’s carrying some weight.”According to Markus, the change was\u0026nbspa way to make Thor more relatable and show the God of Thunder\u0026nbspbecoming “human, for the first time”.Click here to read our review of Avengers: Endgame.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That represents an improvement on the previous month in which the sector shrank, recording 48.9.\u0026nbspBut as a recovery it’s about powerful as a broken down lawn mower engine.It’s de rigueur in any discussion\u0026nbspof economic data to provide a point of context. In the case of this one, the last two months represent the weakest performance signalled by this dataset for six years. \u0026nbspCarney, however, said he believed that surveys like this one may be over stating “Brexit uncertainty”. An example of the Bank being infected by the Brexiteer disease that holds that you’re a bally traitor if you display anything other than mindless optimism about their crazy project?\u0026nbspThat’s pushing it. Carney merely thinks investors are being too dovish and that even a modest improvement in the UK’s outlook would require remedial action from the central bank. Anything above 1.5 per cent - which would hardly put the UK in the class of the Jaguar cars that won’t be being made here for much longer - would do it. \u0026nbspThis, he thinks, is a realistic prospect if the Brexit impasse is finally resolved. He\u0026nbspalso appears to be ruling out a no deal.\u0026nbspHe may very well be guilty of underestimating the depths to which the Tory Party is prepared to sink. Perhaps it’s because he most often talks to Philip Hammond, who is on it’s semi sensible wing.Regardless, savers shouldn\u0027t get too excited about an improvement on the dismal returns they\u0027re currently getting.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, tweeted a couple of important points upon their release. He produced a graph showing that the official GDP data has erged somewhat from the PMI recently, which does happen every now and again.\u0026nbspBut long term they’re quite closely aligned and he noted that it would be “highly unusual for the economy to at least not lose substantial momentum when the PMI has sunk to current levels for more than one month”. The services sector accounts for 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s output, covering everything from City banks to the small dry cleaners where their employees\u0026nbsptake their suits.\u0026nbspThe uncertainty is there. It’s real, and it’s having an impact.

On the table was a bottle of wine. When they ordered a second, there was an audible ripple of admiration around the room. Fellow diners smiled in their direction.\u0026nbspThis scene unfolded recently in a City restaurant. Indeed, the two men looked as if they had met for a bit of a stockbroker reunion, to reminisce about their share trading, and lunching, days.\u0026nbspHardly anyone has a “two bottler” any more. Not at lunch on a work day. One bottle is rare, but a couple –\u0026nbspthat is going some.\u0026nbspEven a glass of wine is relatively scarce. If I look through my diary of a month’s worth of business lunches, those where the other person had a glass (like many, I no longer drink at lunchtime) amount to just a handful.\u0026nbspIn most workplaces today, drinking during working hours is frowned upon, as is consuming enough alcohol in the evening so that your breath smells of it the following morning. Doing the latter once may be okay\u0026nbspdo it twice or more, and you will be marked down as having “a problem”.\u0026nbspLloyd’s of London bans drink and drugs in the workplaceTimes have changed enormously since I started out, first in the City, then in media. Back then, and we’re talking more than three decades ago, it was standard to head to the nearest wine bar or the pub, and polish off a few glasses of wine or pints of beer before returning to your desk and attempting to work.\u0026nbspSometimes, as a junior, you felt obliged to keep your end up, so when the partners at my law firm, all male, lined up another bottle I would gulp and go along with it. Likewise, as a journalist, you occasionally had to go with the flow\u0026nbspas part of the job.\u0026nbspOne of the booziest lunches I ever had was with Crispin Odey, the hedge fund magnate. When I arrived to interview him at Corrigan’s –\u0026nbspthe super-smart Mayfair restaurant of star chef Richard Corrigan –\u0026nbspI was treated like royalty. Odey was running slightly late, and I was shown to a prime table. The staff bustled around, checking I was okay\u0026nbspnothing was too much for them. Finally\u0026nbsphe arrived, and they went into overdrive.A bottle of normally exquisite –\u0026nbspand expensive –\u0026nbspwhite Burgundy was produced, which Odey decided was not quite right. The sommelier scurried away to fetch another one. Odey glanced at the menu and knew what he wanted: a duck egg to start, followed by, if I agreed, a shared steak and kidney pie. “And what about some beef on the side, let’s have the loin of beef on the side. Lovely. Oh, and we’d better have some mash and some kale –\u0026nbspwe ought to have something green.”He called over the wine waiter again: “And we’d like a bottle of the Leoville.” The Leoville Barton was superb, as was the food. This was mid-week. A bottle of white, and a bottle of red. Beef on the side. Even back then, nobody had lunch like this, not any more, not in oh-so politically correct, watching-the-calories, London. Not on this scale, and even more rarely, at this cost. What’s more, with Odey, there was the feeling this was nothing special. The office of his firm, Odey Asset Management, was across the road, and Corrigan’s might as well have been his canteen.As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible, and started to angle down the page,\u0026nbspuntil the words trailed off completelySo, when I read an interview this week with veteran advertising boss Rory Sutherland, I was drawn to his statement that his industry is inordinately less boozy than it was: “Mind you, everything is less boozy. It was pretty routine at lunchtime to see people in the street outside a pub at 2.30 necking pints. It was also routine in advertising, which I always thought was a good thing which we shouldn’t have lost.”Sutherland was reminiscing in the same month that Lloyd’s of London has issued a new stern code of conduct to the 40,000 pass holders at its Leadenhall Street headquarters. From now on, anyone thought to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be refused entry. This, from what was regarded for its 331 year existence as the high temple of lunchtime boozing.\u0026nbspWho is right, who is wrong? Lloyd’s move was motivated by claims of sexual harassment and bad, laddish behaviour. It effectively signals the end for what was known euphemistically in the City as “liquid negotiations” or what Brexiteer Nigel Farage, a former broker, refers to as PFLs\u0026nbsp– “proper f***ing lunches”.\u0026nbspLike Nigel, I enjoyed my PFLs. Like Rory, too, I look back at them with fondness.\u0026nbspBut I also have to ask myself:\u0026nbspapart from spending what, over the years, would have amounted to a considerable sum of money, piling on the calories, and making me feel terrible the rest of the day, what did they actually achieve? Of course, they fostered camaraderie, of the loud, male, kind.\u0026nbspI also\u0026nbspsaw, though, far too many careers and lives ruined by what began as the odd PFL turning into a daily occurrence. A liquid lunch would then be replicated by something similar in the evening, every evening. One of\u0026nbsp those, doubtless, was Guy Farage, a City trader and alcoholic\u0026nbspwho abandoned the family home and his son, Nigel, then aged five.\u0026nbspDid any good come from them? I would venture, not where progress at work was concerned. I attempted to fire questions at Odey. As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible\u0026nbspand started to angle down the page, until the words trailed off completely. I had to finish the interview when I was sober.\u0026nbspLloyd’s initiative is long overdue. We may miss the lunchtime drinking. But if we’re honest, not really.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But thanks to\u0026nbspColston, who started localised growing programmes in 2018, her descendants have survived. Her great-great-great-great granddaughter is sitting at a table made from oak grown from an acorn Colston planted, and harvested at a a sawmill established under Colston’s watch, which has brought business back to the valley. “Thank you for making change happen and thank you for our future,” the descendant writes.\u0026nbspGovernment set to ‘miss public land housebuilding target by 95,000’NHS hospital in England refusing to accept patients from WalesScottish Government plans to tackle land ownership inequalityIt’s Wednesday lunchtime in an empty shopping unit in the Capitol Centre, Cardiff, and Colston is one of of a handful of residents presenting their vision for the future of the Welsh valleys. Nearly 100 people are gathered, including Welsh assembly members, local councillors, forestry authorities and community groups. The Skyline Project has\u0026nbspspent nine months engaging\u0026nbspartists to unlock residents’\u0026nbspideas about their natural environment. The resulting maps and quotations are pasted all over the gallery walls, including dreams of swimming pools, walking routes, honeybees and wild birds.Colston’s postcard might be fantasy today, but Skyline\u0026nbspsees this artistic reimagining as the first step to a community action plan for the land.One man is here to show them what’s possible. Alastair McIntosh was one of four founders of the Isle of Eigg Trust in 1991, which in the space of six years wrested the island in the Scottish Hebrides from rich owners and put it in the hands of the community. “It’s not about sloganising politics, it’s about figuring out things that are going to work,” he says. “You have to start digging with a teaspoon, then a spade, then a digger, and then political confidence to flow into those channels.”But Scotland has a very different tradition of land ownership. As well as positive examples of community ownership, Scotland has a history of crofting, or long term leases of private land to stewards, and momentum is growing for further reform. An investigation by the Scottish Land Commission found that concentrated land ownership in Scotland, where 1,125 people own 70 per cent of the land, has held back prospects for economic, housing and community development. The commission went so far as to describe the concentration of land ownership in Scotland as “socially corrosive”.The situation in Wales is different. Wales has fewer private landowners. It also has much more public land. The question for the groups involved in Skyline is whether they can get public bodies to support their ideas. “Being able to get land is a political thing,” says Mark Walton, the co-director of Shared Assets. “In Scotland it required legislation. What’s exciting is that Skyline is looking at what is already publicly owned land. It is in the gift of authorities to transfer ownership to communities or give them leases to allow the to manage productively. That’s a massive opportunity because it overcomes the main barrier to entry, which is the cost of buying the land.”Walton says that an ambitious programme of land transfer to communities in urban areas has the potential to revitalise areas still reeling from the death of traditional industry, particularly in Wales and the north of England. But he acknowledges that is it sometimes difficult for authorities to cede power: “Authorities are afraid because this fundamentally changes the relationship between the state and the people. It changes the way the civil servants behave. It changes the dynamic – and that is scary.”Ian Thomas, runs Welcome to Our Woods, a community partnership in the upper Rhondda Fawr making local natural resources accessible to residents. In May, Welcome to Our Woods was awarded £90,000 in grants and loans from the Co-op Foundation, to put towards its project converting waste wood into furniture and biomass fuel, generating income. The money has been generated by the sale of 5p bags in the Co-op’s Welsh supermarkets.In October, Thomas, Colston and other volunteers from other valleys groups visited the Kilfinan Community Forest in Tighnabruaich, which manages ownership of 434 hectares of Acharossan Forest. Chris Blake, who started the Skyline Project, says that the trip proved the possibilities. “To see for yourselves what the forest crofts has achieved in eight years was quite staggering,” he says. “At the end of the day we sat down and suddenly we realised it can be done.”Geraint Davies, the Plaid Cymru councillor for Treherbert ward, is among those at the event in the shopping centre. As visitors browse\u0026nbspthe exhibition, he remembers playing in the mountains as a child:\u0026nbsp“We used to be up there making dams, but you don’t see children up there now.”Would he support community ownership of the land? “I think that would be wonderful,” he says. “It’s very important to get people committed to the area through ownership. In the past people have come in, done things, and gone again.”Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport at the Welsh assembly, sees Skyline as part of a broader movement for the democratic ownership of land and the economy that is going on in places like Preston in Lancashire and Barcelona in Spain.How South Wales is learning from community forests in Scotland“There has been a profound change going on in the valleys in just two generations. There’s been considerable depopulation\u0026nbspand some areas are returning to semi-rural, which creates a range of policy challenges but also opens up a new way of doing things,” Waters says. “Might the Welsh government give Skyline funding for land? There’s absolutely no reason why we wouldn’t. We’d have to see some detail but I think it’s got huge potential.”Thomas says the seeds of change have already been planted. “When we looked at our land we found that 85 per cent is public estate,” he says. “So we’re not talking about ownership because as far as we’re concerned we already own the land. It’s about what level of stewardship we get. What we are looking at is a micro-hydro scheme, a sawmill, solar farms and forest crofts. This land is opportunity for us.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But does everyone have what it takes to get a book deal?\u0026nbspBesides a great idea, you arguably need\u0026nbsptalent, time and dedication to tip yourself over the line from aspiring writer to published author. In 2019, you may also need a social media following.\u0026nbspTake Pinch of Nom, a cookbook by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson, which sold more than 210,000 copies in three days.Pinch of Nom was the UK’s most read cooking blog. Another major factor contributing to the duo’s potential was their strong Facebook group following of more than 800,000 people, a very engaged and responsive community which shared recipes and slimming tips, not counting the 1.4 million people who like their public Facebook page. These numbers are all the more impressive given the authors didn’t launch the Facebook group until 2016.The arguable starting point for social media-fuelled book deals started with YouTube. A few years ago, many of the popular vloggers won deals. Zoella, aka Zoe Sugg, published her first novel at age 24 with Penguin in 2014. Her first week sales numbers outstripped Harry Potter and Fifty Shades of Grey (Sugg later admitted the book was ghost written). But by 2017, publishers were complaining the YouTube market was saturated, and were sometimes seeing disappointing UK e-book sales and waning interest from certain foreign markets.Anna Steadman, a senior commissioning editor at a publisher called Headline, described this phenomenon as the “YouTube gold rush”. She added that publishers now take a more nuanced view of the different social media platforms and how that might affect book sales.\u0026nbsp“People can have 250,000 followers on Instagram, for example, but that doesn’t always translate into sales,” she said. “Instagram can be quite a passive medium, where people are mainly looking at pictures, while a smaller Twitter or Facebook following, for example, can sometimes be more engaged.”Created with Sketch.Social media influencers who got book deals Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate AllinsonGirl Online by Zoella The Unmumsy Mum by Sarah TurnerWhy Mummy Drinks by Gill SimsMan vs Toddler by Matt CoynePinch of Nom by Kay Featherstone and Kate AllinsonGirl Online by Zoella The Unmumsy Mum by Sarah TurnerWhy Mummy Drinks by Gill SimsMan vs Toddler by Matt CoyneAfter the YouTube books came the so-called mummy bloggers. Those that sold very well all had strong followings on Facebook. The Unmumsy Mum, by Sarah Turner, was published last year, five years after Turner started her blog and gathering 650,000 Facebook followers in the meantime. Why Mummy Drinks, by Gill Sims, was published in 2017 and also followed on from a blog. Sims currently has 407,000 Facebook followers. Man vs. Toddler: The Trials and Triumphs of Toddlerdom, by Matt Coyne, also started off as a blog and he now has 241,000 fans on the social media platform.‘Ask children about impact of social media’, psychiatrists toldIn an age where people can buy Twitter followers, and where Facebook is accused of artificially inflating video viewing figures, publishers are less likely to take big numbers at face value. As Steadman explained, they look for quality over quantity – good news for those of us who could never hope to replicate Pinch of Nom’s Facebook success.Nonetheless, social media numbers do still come into it. Alex Holder, who has just published her debut non-fiction book, Open Up: The Power of Talking About Money, said at least one editor rejected her proposal due to her social media. She has more than 4,000 Twitter followers.Holder ended up getting a deal with Serpent’s Tail. There is very little transparency around how much authors are paid, so trying to determine whether authors get offered more if they have a large social media following is almost impossible. Holder is one of the few authors to reveal the advance for her debut (£12,500) and she wrote an article arguing that more people should reveal their advances to increase transparency in the industry. However, she said she understands some publishers’ initial hesitation when it comes to judging a person’s social media following.Sometimes, all publishers say ‘no thanks’ and the author in question has to take a different tact.\u0026nbspAlice-May Purkiss, author of Life, Lemons and Melons, her memoir about battling breast cancer, said that despite her “incredible agent” and the excitement from publishers, her social media following was cited as the reason to not give her a deal.Bestsellers on AmazonPinch of Nom: 100 Slimming Home-Style Recipes by Kay Featherstone and Kate Allinson (813,000 Facebook group members)Hinch Yourself Happy: All The Best Cleaning Tips To Shine Your Sink And Soothe Your Soul by Mrs Hinch (126,000 Facebook group members)5 Ingredients – Quick \u0026amp Easy Food, by Jamie Oliver (6.9m Facebook page followers)Mary Berry’s Quick Cooking, by Mary Berry (366,000 Facebook page followers)This Is Going To Hurt: Secret Diaries of a Junior Doctor, by Adam Kay (67,000\u0026nbspTwitter followers)“I had around 3,000 followers across the platforms, which I totally accept is small but I guess I hoped that the idea and my writing would be enough to carry the project,” she said.\u0026nbspThat was two years ago. Since then she decided to self-publish, creating a Kickstarted campaign. She raised £5,000 for the first print run and donated 10 per cent\u0026nbspof the proceeds to charity.Part of the reason publishers and agents get excited about social media is the way they can generate pre-sales, before the book is printed. If an author can generate enough pre-sales themselves, even without social media, a publisher may then offer a contract.Another hot trend in the non-fiction category millennial memoirs, with recent and upcoming books from many well-known journalists and writers with social media followings, including Joel Golby, Bryony Gordon, Daisy Buchanan and Hannah Witton, who has her own YouTube channel. The memoir trend arguably reached new heights after the publication last year of Dolly Alderton’s memoir and Sunday Times best-seller, Everything I Know About Love.Anna Steadman was part of the team that bought Alderton’s memoir at Fig Tree (Penguin) before she moved to Headline. Speaking generally about memoirs, Steadman said: “Unless you have a genuinely incredible story, and even if you do,, it helps to have a fanbase who wants to read your story – it could be a newspaper column or a Facebook page but if no one has heard of you then of course it will be harder to sell your book.”Steadman added that publishers are always looking to break an author out beyond their fanbase, however large, because they want to publish work that will resonate with existing fans as well as people who might not have come across that writer before. Essentially, throwing the net as wide as possible.Social media firms to be legally forced to protect usersObama urges young people to fight ‘negative politics’ of social mediaSurge in prisoners’ social media accounts being closed downBut what about fiction?\u0026nbspAnna Davis is a literary agent at Curtis Brown and director of the Curtis Brown Creative writing school. Since inception in 2011, the writing courses have seen 63 of their alumni secure book deals for their first novel, either via working with Curtis Brown or with other agents.\u0026nbsp“I’m not aware of any situations in fiction where someone has been turned down for not having a social media following,” Davis insisted. “I don’t believe it, in fact. Most important is the book, and anything else is an extra.”Davis added: “There will always be writers not taken on by agents and publishers. Sometimes they want to point the finger at something specific, like the writer’s social media following, but I doubt that’s the real reason in all but a few places.”In fiction, some authors do not engage online at all, or some write under pseudonyms, like Elena Ferrante. But even Ferrante engages in traditional publicity, for example giving interviews. Many people in the publishing industry look at the top 100 best-selling lists on Amazon, which are updated every hour: the rankings can change as soon as an author appears on a radio show or has an article published, for example.Many novelists that The Independent spoke to agreed that social media was less important when it came to securing a deal in fiction, compared to other categories.“It’s all about the book,” said Fiona Mitchell, who has a two-book deal with Hodder. “Social media helps, probably, but it’s not essential to land a deal. Besides, there’s such a long lead in from getting signed to publication that you can build social media in that time.”Social media helps, probably, but it’s not essential to land a deal.\u0026nbsp There’s such a long lead in from getting signed to publication that you can build social media in that timeThere can be many months, if not years, between birthing an idea for a book and publication day. In the run up to publication, authors are encouraged to share their contacts of people who might be willing to review or read their proofs, as well as engage in social media – although this advice is not usually part of a contract with a publisher.“If you don’t have a big budget assigned to you, as is the case with most authors, you meet your publicist, discuss personal contacts, who to send proofs to, and who could maybe review the book or do a reading,” said Davis. “A great address book has always been a boon. But now with social media you’ll see your publicist and they will say, ‘You have 50,000 followers – what can we do with that?’”Twitter is a useful platform to engage with other writers, too. Crime writers, for example, are known for being supportive and generous towards each other’s work.One of those crime authors is Erin Kelly, who says all the crime writers she knows now she met on Twitter. Those conversations, she said, migrated to Facebook and then became real life friendships. Kelly was signed 10 years ago, before social media became mainstream. Now she regularly posts on Twitter, but said it was a gradual process.Bestsellers on AmazonMy Lovely Wife, by Samantha Downing (1,938 Twitter followers)The Rumour, by Lesley Kara (1,191 Twitter followers)No Way Out, by Cara Hunter (3,593 Twitter followers)The World Walker, by Ian W Sainsbury (748 Facebook followers and just 229 Twitter followers)“Marketing departments will walk you through it, if you’re new to social media,” she said. “They will show you who to follow or emulate, and how to do it.”She insists that her books and social media channels are two separate brands.\u0026nbsp“My Twitter is funny and light and I avoid politics – politics make my blood pressure scoot off the scale. Instead, I share books I’m reading and talk about culture and music,” she said. “I find that doing that is the way forward. But there’s no graph to show whether that leads to book sales. I imagine it’s more a gentle encouragement.”Kelly added that being present on social media should not be all about self-promotion, as people will switch off.\u0026nbsp“I would always encourage an author to talk about their book in context, instead of saying ‘buy my book, buy my book’,” she said. “I always follow people I’m genuinely interested in and I don’t do strategic follows.”The irony is that building up and engaging with your following can take you away from your writing – the most important part of the whole process. For example, Kelly said she bought an app called Freedom for about £30 so she can get her writing done – currently she has a rate of a new book every year.“Some authors become so anxious developing a following it becomes counterproductive,” advised Davis. “And if an author is really uncomfortable going on social media, I would tell them not to do it.\u0027\u0027Pinch of NomOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also examines how\u0026nbsp”we absorb such influences in our minds and our bodies”, as well as the “promotion of values in symbols and propaganda”. The exhibition ends with a call to “reboot the world”.\u0026nbspThe gallery rejected demands to remove the paintings entirely, arguing that visitors should be able to see the works and draw their own conclusions. The artist instead requested they were covered.\u0026nbsp“It seemed a respectful solution that enables a debate about freedom of expression versus the perceived right not to be offended,” he said.While the gallery said it “fully supported” freedom of expression as a fundamental right, it added: “the gallery\u0026nbspalso recognises the sincerity of the complaints made against these works and supported the artist’s decision to cover them until the end of the exhibition.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sites are in\u0026nbspthe ancestral lands of Zuni Native Americans, who granted permission for their word “suski” to be part of the new name.Palaeontologists have yet to find any specimen with arm bones, so it remains a mystery as to whether Suskityrannus shared T-rex’s least impressive feature.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Gemini IV crew conducted scientific experiments, including photography of Earth\u0027s weather and terrain, for the remainder of their four-day mission following Ed White\u0027s historic spacewalk on June 31230 Frosty slopes of MarsThis image of an area on the surface of Mars, approximately 1.5 by 3 kilometers in size, shows frosted gullies on a south-facing slope within a crater. The image was taken by Nasa\u0027s HiRISE camera, which is mounted on its Mars Reconaissance Orbiter1330 Yellowstone from spaceNASA astronaut Reid Wiseman shared this image of Yellowstone via his twitter accountThis near-infrared color image shows a specular reflection, or sunglint, off of a hydrocarbon lake named Kivu Lacus on Saturn\u0027s moon TitanAlthough Mimas and Pandora, shown here, both orbit Saturn, they are very different moons. Pandora, small by moon standards (50 miles or 81 kilometers across) is elongated and irregular in shape. Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across), a medium-sized moon, formed into a sphere due to self-gravity imposed by its higher massAn X1.6 class solar flare flashes in the middle of the sun in this image taken 10 September, captured by NASA\u0027s Solar Dynamics ObservatoryAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory.

On this mission, Kathryn Sullivan became the first U.S. woman to perform a spacewalk and Marc Garneau became the first Canadian in space. The crew of seven was the largest to fly on a spacecraft at that time, and STS-41G was the first flight to include two female astronauts2130 A Fresh Perspective on an Extraordinary Cluster of GalaxiesGalaxy clusters are often described by superlatives. After all, they are huge conglomerations of galaxies, hot gas, and dark matter and represent the largest structures in the Universe held together by gravityThe arrangement of the spiral arms in the galaxy Messier 63, seen here in an image from the Nasa Hubble Space Telescope, recall the pattern at the center of a sunflowerFour images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) were combined with colour data from the Ralph instrument to create this enhanced colour global view of Pluto2430 Fresh Crater Near Sirenum Fossae Region of MarsThe HiRISE camera aboard Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter acquired this closeup image of a fresh (on a geological scale, though quite old on a human scale) impact crater in the Sirenum Fossae region of Mars.

There were no injuries. SpaceX had taken all safety measures prior to this test, as we always do.The news conference was called ahead of Friday\u0027s scheduled launch of an unmanned resupply mission to the international space station using a cargo-only capsule built by SpaceX, the private rocket venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.When pressed, Koenigsmann declined to characterise the nature of the accident, including whether an explosion or fire was involved. NASA has likewise demurred when asked to describe the mishap.A leaked video of the accident, which was acknowledged as authentic by a NASA contractor in an internal memo obtained by the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, showed the astronaut capsule blasting into smithereens. A pall of smoke was also widely observed rising over the launch pad from a distance at the time of the ill-fated test.The Crew Dragon had been scheduled to carry US\u0026nbspastronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a test mission in July, although the recent accident, as well as some other hitches in the vehicle\u0027s design, are likely to push that schedule to later in the year or into 2020.It\u0027s certainly not great news for the schedule overall, but I hope we can recover, Koenigsmann said.The destroyed vehicle was one of six such capsules built or in late production by SpaceX, and the first flown into space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched it without crew to the space station in March for a six-day visit before returning to Earth, splashing down safely in the Atlantic for retrieval.We have no reason to believe there is an issue with the SuperDracos themselves, Koenigsmann said, adding that the engines have been tested nearly 600 times in the past.NASA has been awarded $6.8bn to SpaceX and rival Boeing Co to develop separate capsule systems to fly astronauts to space, but both companies have faced technical challenges and delays.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I lost any sense of independence. It was just things like getting to the supermarket – just ordinary, mundane things that a lot of people who don’t have mobility needs wouldn’t think twice about. It’s so restricting.”Ms Jones\u0026nbsptook her\u0026nbspcase to tribunal, and\u0026nbspjust a week before the hearing, a Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) caseworker phoned her and said her original support would be reinstated.She said that while she was pleased to now be in receipt of her entitled benefits, many other disabled people did not have\u0026nbspthe resilience to fight negative\u0026nbspdecisions. She\u0026nbspcited\u0026nbspthe case of one friend who killed himself after being refused PIP\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspthen sanctioned for failing to attend the job centre.She added: “I’m convinced that this tactic of refusing mandatory reconsiderations is because they know that a lot of us can’t cope with the stress of going to a court and that a lot of people will just say I can’t do it. So people are then going on to unemployment benefit and they are not coping.Disability benefit cuts ‘will cost taxpayers more than they will save’Waiting time for disability benefits up by three weeks in three months“It took over half a year to get mine sorted out and now, in just a few months’ time, I know these forms are going to come through my door yet again. It’s a dread every time the letter box goes.“The support getting into work is great for some people, but there are many of us who have tried and tried to work and can’t, and now it feels like we’re being whitewashed out of existence.”In another case, the husband of a PIP\u0026nbspclaimant, who did not want to be named, said his wife lost £123.45 a week when she was reassessed in December 2018. That\u0026nbspincluded\u0026nbsp£64 in the\u0026nbspcarer support element of her award, meaning her 30-year-old daughter now cares for her full-time with\u0026nbspno financial support.The 68-year-old man, whose wife suffers from epilepsy and subsequent memory issues, said: “She had been getting that quite happily for 20 odd years, and suddenly someone turns around and says you’re not getting it at all.“They are trying to cut money without looking at the circumstances. Yes, there are fraudulent people out there, but those people know how to play the system and it’s the honest people who seem to be getting hammered by this.\u0026nbsp“It is affecting people like my wife who as a result of epilepsy has got memory problems, but they don’t appear to care.”Ian Lavery, the Labour MP who obtained the figures through a parliamentary question, said the\u0026nbspcurrent benefits system was “driving people into destitution”.He said that in the year to March 2019, his office helped constituents win back a total of\u0026nbsp£275,011 in PIP\u0026nbspclaims and appeals, and that even the local authorities welfare support team were passing cases to his caseworkers.Waiting time for disability benefits up by three weeks in three monthsAnna Bird, executive director of policy and research at disability equality charity Scope, said: “PIP is a lifeline that exists because life costs more if you are disabled.\u0026nbspIt’s vital that disabled people get the financial support they need.“The government needs to listen to these frustrations and act quickly to overhaul PIP assessments and get to grips with the routine inaccuracies disabled people experience.”Genevieve Edwards, of the MS Society, said: “This surge in complaints is not at all surprising, given the assessment process is so completely inadequate for disabled people.\u0026nbsp“We\u0026nbspfrequently hear about how the process causes great anxiety, stress and harm to people’s health. Even those who’ve had increased support say the process takes a toll on their emotional and physical wellbeing.”A DWP spokesperson said: “We want the PIP assessment process to work well for everyone and have made significant improvements, including testing the video recording of assessments. This year complaints represented less than 1 per cent\u0026nbspof all PIP assessments.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

By Monday the painting of the 29-year-old journalist, who was shot dead last month, had attracted visitors who stopped\u0026nbspto take photographs of the mural.The image of a smiling Ms McKee appears alongside a moving letter she wrote to her 14-year-old self.The piece touched on her struggles as a gay teenager growing up in Northern Ireland and\u0026nbspspread quickly online in the hours after she was shot dead\u0026nbspby a stray bullet\u0026nbspon 18 April during a riot in the city of Derry.\u0026nbsp“It won’t always be like this. It’s going to get better,” Ms McKee wrote in the letter.\u0026nbsp“Street art is always dialogue,” said Adam Turkington, the art festival’s organiser.\u0026nbsp“Writing on a wall is always political, whether you realise it or not.\u0026nbspI think what’s been really interesting is how you’ve seen that the aftermath of\u0026nbspLyra‘s death has played out in art on walls – whether it’s the bloody hand prints on the office walls or whether it’s people painting over the IRA murals in Derry. That’s activism.“Street art has its roots in activism and in anti-establishment-ism, but also in finding ways to communicate with each other about things that really are hard to talk about.“It’s about aesthetic, it’s about place-making. And especially in the context of Northern Ireland, where we have these very isive murals, street art for me in this context is all about building a shared space and finding a place that people can co-exist.”“It’s a very natural thing in a way that\u0026nbspLyra\u0026nbsphas been represented in this way at the festival and long may it continue.”The mural’s location, in Kent Street in Belfast’s centre, is also significant.The painting\u0026nbspfaces an existing piece of street art which\u0026nbspprovided a striking backdrop for a photograph of Ms McKee\u0026nbspthat was widely circulated in the wake of her death.The 29-year-old was killed by the so-called New IRA while covering dissident rioting in Derry last month.Her death has sparked outrage across the world as well as a swell of criticism for dissident republican violence in Northern Ireland.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The state is the most populous and offers the greatest number of seats for parties contesting the election.And while victories across rural heartlands in Uttar Pradesh were the driving force behind Narendra Modi’s sweeping 2014 victory, the state includes two seats that can be counted among the strongest bastions for the opposition Congress party.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is seeking a fourth consecutive election in the seat of Amethi, while his mother Sonia Gandhi is running in neighbouring Rae Bareli. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Rahul’s sister, recently entered politics as the party’s national general secretary and has been campaigning hard in both districts.\u0026nbspAmethi was held by Rahul’s father, the former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, before his assassination in 1991, and its history as a Congress seat goes back further than that still.But Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) says the Nehru-Gandhi family’s hold on Amethi is slipping. Contesting the seat is the government\u0027s popular textile minister, the former model and TV actress Smriti Irani, who lost to Mr Gandhi in 2014 but in the last five years has steered central government funds for development to the constituency and visited often.“This time BJP is going to win the election,” Irani told the Associated Press. “They promised the moon to these people but in reality Amethi is one of the most neglected constituencies because Gandhis never took interest in development of this region.”In what the BJP called a move preempting defeat in Amethi, Mr Gandhi has also stood for election in Wayanad, Kerala. Congress said it was simply a way of showing the party’s commitment to southern India. Under election rules, candidates can contest multiple constituencies and if they win more than one, nominate the one they want to represent and give up the others.Sonia Gandhi, herself a former president of Congress and now chair of the Congress-led left-wing United Progressive Alliance coalition of parties, is held in high esteem in Rae Bareli and, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, would take the seat for a fifth time.She also predicted her brother would increase his majority in Amethi, which was slashed in 2014. “There is an emotional attachment between the people of Amethi and Congress, she said.\u0026nbspElsewhere in the state, the central government\u0027s powerful Home Minister Rajnath Singh was in the fray from Lucknow. And another minister from the Modi administration, Maneka Gandhi - who has strained relations with her sister-in-law Sonia Gandhi - is contesting from Sultanpur.Meanwhile, across the country in Odisha, Mr Modi used a visit to survey communities affected by the deadly cyclone Fani to lash out at his regional political rivals on India’s eastern coast.Two dead as ‘extremely severe’ Cyclone Fani strikes IndiaIndia demands Pakistan be punished after UN lists ‘global terrorist’800,000 evacuated from homes in India as huge storm heads for coastMillionaires and Bollywood stars vote alongside Mumbai slum-dwellersTikTok ban in India overturned after reassurances over porn videosIs India\u0027s economic growth really all down to Modi? Speaking at a rally in Tamluk, West Bengal, the prime minister said he had twice tried to contact the state’s chief minister Mamata Banerjee to discuss the relief effort “but she did not respond”. “She is least bothered about the people of Bengal,” he told supporters.Ms Banerjee is one of the biggest thorns in the BJP’s side, leader of the powerful regional Trinamool Congress (TMC) party.Ms Banerjee hit back that while Mr Modi was running his political campaigns, she was too busy to take his call because she was in Kharagpur, a town near Kolkata to monitor the ground situation after the cyclone.It is the standard of discourse that has come to define this election, where discussions of policy have often taken a backseat to personal jibes and name-calling.When the issues are discussed, Mr Modi and the BJP leadership have focussed on national security, playing up the threat of neighbouring Pakistan especially in the wake of the February suicide bomb attack in Pulwama, Kashmir.Pulwama, part of the Anantnag constituency, was itself voting under high security on Monday, though turnout was low amid calls from separatists for a boycott.It is the only seat in the country where voting has been split by district over three phases, such is the level of unrest. Police said that on Monday suspected rebels lobbed a grenade at a polling station in a village near Pulwama town. No one was reported hurt.The 39-day process of deciding the fate of India’s political future will be completed on 19 May. Counting and results are expected on 23 May.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It sent\u0026nbspthe Turkish lira, already battered by inflation and high borrowing costs, tumbling.\u0026nbspMr Imamoglu appearing\u0026nbspbefore a crowd of supporters struck a defiant tone.We won this election by the hard work of millions of people they attempted to steal our rightfully won elections, he said.\u0026nbspWe are thirsty for justice. The decision-makers in this country may be in a state unawareness, error or even treason, but we will never give up.As shock and anger over the news spread, supporters of Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspbegan banging pots and pans in a cacophony of peaceful protest throughout the city.One of the worst days for Turkey’s beleaguered democracy, wrote Asli Adintasbas, a journalist and commentator.Mr Imamoglu was handed the mandate to govern last month, lifting the spirits of Erdogan’s opponents, despite vague and unsubstantiated\u0026nbspaccusations of cheating and election fraud by the AKP and its loyalists.Mr Imamoglu’s victory marked the first time in 25 years that Istanbul, a city of 16 million that is Turkey\u0027s economic powerhouse, fell out of the hands of Mr Erdogan’s political party. The AKP also lost control of the capital, Ankara, for the first time in 25 years but with a much larger margin.\u0026nbspThe YSK\u0026nbspoverturned the election results on a technicality, arguing that some of those who served on election boards in the city were not civil servants. Mr Imamoglu mocked the ruling.\u0026nbspWith the same election rules, a president has been elected, a referendum has been held, so there is also uncertainty over the Constitution and the President\u0027s position, he said.Mr Imamoglu\u0027s opponent, Binali Yilidrim, said he would wait for the final election commission ruling to emerge before weighing in.Istanbul is a major source of patronage cash, with real-estate deals used to seal ties between the AKP and developers who are the pillar of the party. Municipal election losses enraged AKP supporters, causing ision within the party\u0027s ranks.\u0026nbspWhile new elections -- said to scheduled for either 23 June or 7 July -- could bring Istanbul back under the control of the AKP, it also carries political risk, should the party lose by even a larger margin. Already the party\u0027s handling of the election loss had made it look petty and power hungry, while cementing the unflappable Mr Imamoglu\u0027s\u0026nbspstature as a national political phenomenon.The AKP has single-handedly created a hero of the people as the economy crashes around them, wrote commentator and frequent AKP critic Can Okar.

I was beautully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her.I thought Im really gonna have to up my game, sit down and make sure I have good chat.They tied the knot on May , , at St Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle, which is where Harry was christened when he was three months old.Since then, the couple have been on whirlwind royal tours to Morocco and Australia as they continue to throw the royal family into the st century.Royal fans are eagerly waiting to see what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will call their newborn son.Members of the royal family traditionally opt for conventional, regal names with a nod to history, but forward-thinking Harry and Meghan may want to do things their own way and pick something more modern.The child will be eligible for dual British-U.S. citizenshipMeghan and Harry want to go through the application process.Diana had been expected to be among the names for a girl in tribute to Harrys late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, but he could decide to honour her by using Spencer - the princesss family name - as one of his sons names.Other options could include Charles, after the Prince of Wales, Philip, after the Duke of Edinburgh, or royal favourites James, Albert, Frederick, Arthur or even Henry - Harrys actual first name. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Wages still too low.But the PM could hammer home our historically low unemployment, record high employment, pay now rising much faster than inflation, the deficit finally reduced to manageable levels, the richest now paying a higher percentage of tax than ever.She could talk up the Tories slashing the number of workless households which shamefully built up under Labour’s welfare culture. Or their world-beating record on climate change.But mostly Mrs May indulges Corbyn’s fictions, changes the subject or snarks back. Which gives his case credence.It’s time she faced facts. The party she has devoted her le to is demoralised, exhausted and staring into the abyss.Only a charismatic new leader can energise it, pull it together, focus minds on its successes and convince Britain it is worth voting for.And only thenit delivers Brexit as promised.THINGS look bad for the Tories and Labour, but they’re in for a far worse shock.A local election millions of Brexiteers snubbed is no real guide to any party’s fortunes.If  per cent of voters back Nigel Farage’s outfit at the European elections in three weeks the damage to the main parties will be truly vast.It may wipe the temporary grins off Lib-Dem faces too — more so“Change UK” eat into their Remainer vote.The Tories had a shocker on Thursday but at least they expected it.They’ve been in power nine years. They’ve failed so far on Brexit. Labour, though, is out of excuses for their staggering losses, despite a Government in disarray.Sensible MPs know the truth. Their incoherent, anti-Semitic extremist of a leader is toxic among anyone remotely normal. Their two-faced Brexit position is a laughing stock no one understands.These local elections were grim enough for them and the Tories, but they look like the calm before the storm.The Euro elections and next General Election could change our politics entirely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They want a clean break.Ignoring them will be politically fatal.A FOREIGN holiday is a well-deserved break for many hard-working families.So it beggars belief that Labour is considering slapping a new tax on Brits who diligently save up their cash so they can fly abroad more than once a year.Under a frequent flyer levy, anyone will be penalised when they land back in Britain for the second time. The amount would rise for subsequent journeys.Labour eco-zealots said the plans were aimed at the rich.But millions of ordinary families will find the cost of their holidays rising yet again.Jeremy Corbyn and his Marxist rabble plan to use every aspect of our lives to fleece us.THE police have announced that Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson didn’t commit a crime by allegedly leaking information about the Chinese tech giant Huawei.In fact, they said, he didn’t break Britain’s Official Secrets Act, didn’t commit an act of misconduct in public office and it wasn’t a police matter at all.Anyone might think he was fired on Wednesday to ert attention from Mrs May’s Brexit deal with Labour on the eve of the local elections.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s their antics that have cost us tonight.”He was just one of several leading Labour councillors who spoke in similarly scathing terms about the damage done by their party’s Brexit shenanigans.And it affects the Conservative Party just as much — , lost council seats can be seen no other way.Anybody who has knocked on a door in the last few weeks knows this is how the country feels and realises the danger our democratic system facesthis lack of trust is not addressed.The public holds both major parties responsible.Unfortunately, it has reached the stage now where one fears the worst and wonders what next pitfall awaits.There are at least two imminent bear traps.The first is a pact with the devil, whereby the Prime Minister does a deal with Jeremy Corbyn simply to wish the problem of Brexit away.Of course, it won’t work. If the UK remains in the Customs Union, it will be a betrayal of Brexit.It will lead to a path that leads to remaining in the single market and subjection to EU law, and it will stop the UK making trade deals with the rest of the world.What a pathetic state of affairs. Essentially agreeing anything, just anything, so long as we no longer have to talk about Brexit. Of course, this would be disastrous. Corbyn is a neo-Marxist.The public do not trust him. This is another clear message from these local elections. Why do deals with somebody so discredited  The very idea filled Conservative councillors, and not a few Tory voters, with fury during this campaign.The second trap would be carrying on regardless.Stick with the Prime Minister’s thrice-rejected deal and claim “there is no alternative”.This seems to be the default position on this Government since last summer.This path will lead to more disagreement, more misery and a hammering in the European Elections the like of which no governing party has ever seen.The Government’s proposed Withdrawal Agreement is deeply flawed.How many times have they been told this  It subjects the UK to EU law-making and hands over £billion for very little in .It was only able to be made tolerablethe Northern Ireland backstop was scrapped or time limited. This is why the House of Commons passed the Brady Amendment.Notably it was literally the only thing the House could agree on.The message was clear — scrap the backstop. Replace with common sense proposals. Anything less is unacceptable.So, what should the Government do now Obviously, it should honour the pledges of all major parties and carry out Brexit speedily and cleanly, preferably with a deal, but failing that, without a deal.That is what the public was promised and that is what the public expects.I have lost count of the number of members of the public who have come up to me, astonished bythe “naivety of a House of Commons who threw away our strongest negotiating card, the threat of No Deal”.It might be politically dficult. It might need courage. But nothing  will suffice.Ignoring the millions of protest votes and spoilt ballot papers will lead to nothing but further misery.The public will respect an admission that mistakes have been made.It will respect an attempt to reconnect the Conservative Party with its voters, activists and members.To ignore one of the angriest responses we have ever witnessed at election time would be suicidal. Surely nobody wants that  Face up, be realistic and put right the mistakes.Go back to the EU and give it one last chance. Renegotiate an acceptable agreement, or we will leave calmly and speedily without a deal.Scrap the European Elections and set the date for leaving as June . It is the only way forward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is Dmitry Khlebushkin. He saved his backpack.And he is looking really great, knowing that everyone further back than the th row died.It has not been confirmed whether or not Mr Khlebushkin was aware of the numbers in the rows behind him who perished.Reports say only three passengers behind the passenger - who was reportedly sitting in seat C - managed to flee the plane.Some passengers threw their bags down the slide as others were burning to death at the rear of the plane.One comment stated: “The first passengers tried to throw out their bags from the cabin and then to slide down. This is why there are delays.”Khlebushkin had praised the stewardesses for help in evacuating the plane.“It was dark, the temperature was high, they were pulling people out of there,” he said. “They helped people to go down the slide.”But then he is reported to have told Le online news: “I failed to get a refund for my ticket for  minutes. And in the end I did not get it at all.ForumAvia said: “That fat man from the video who was angry that he did not get a refund within  minutes – he surely took his bag from the overhead compartment despite all the other people.Asked how the emergency started, the man said:  “I am tired and I won’t speak about it now.I will tell the Investigative Committee” - which has opened a criminal case into the crash.The man also reportedly complained that his blood pressure was high after the incident.“My blood pressure is   and I have arrhythmia,” he said. “I cannot stop. I want to live.”He was then ushered to an ambulance outside the airport.Earlier it was revealed how a hero stewardess pushed passengers out of a burning plane while escape routes were blocked by people grabbing luggage from overhead lockers, its been reported.Harrowing footage shows flames licking at the planes windows as it was engulfed in a huge fireball.Other footage appears to show the rear of the jet consumed by flames even before the crash landing at Sheremetyevo airport juts  minutes after takeoff.Desperate passengers were filmed escaping down emergency chutes and sprinting away, some holding their luggage - as officials claimed the evacuation was hindered by those stopping to grab their bags.Stewardess Tatyana Kasatkina, , revealed how she kicked the plane’s door open and physically pushed passengers out onto the emergency slide to safety.“When the plane stopped, the evacuation immediately began,” she said.“Everyone was shouting that we were on fire.  But there was no fire inside the cabin at this moment.“I kicked the door out with my leg and pushed out the passengers so as not to slow the evacuation.“Just to hurry them up I grabbed each of them by the collar from the back.The emotional stewardess added: “It was all so quick.  The smoke was already black.  The last people were crawling to get out.“Everyone had jumped from their seats and moved forwards, although the plane was still moving at a good speed.“I saw the first woman calling somebody on her phone and saying – ‘we are on fire, we are falling down.Fire crews worked to extinguish the massive flames as desperate survivors escaped the jetThe youngest fatality in the Moscow air tragedy was Sofia Novikova, , who died alongside her doctor father Evgeny Novikov.Footage showing survivors emerging carrying bags and coats shows how passengers “cost lives” because those stranded at the rear of the plane could not get out, said unnamed experts cited by Vesti.ru.The rear emergency doors were not accessible because of the blaze.Survivors have praised the heroic cabin crew rescued them from the flaming wreckage.Dmitry Khlebnikov said: “I thank God  - and the stewardesses who saved me.“They were always with us, helping people to climb the slide and get out of the cabin full of smoke. It was dark and incredibly hot inside.”Another witness said it was a miracle that anyone had survived, as chilling pictures of the aftermath showed the blackened burnt-out wreck.Earlier the death toll was estimated at  including children, but investigators confirmed late on Sunday that dozens had died in the inferno.Investigators are understood to be examining all possible causes of the tragedy including the theory that the plane was hit by lightning.There were  people on board, including [five] crew members, the Russian Investigative Committee said in a statement. According to updated information,  out of them survived.Flight attendant Maxim Moiseev was said to have been killed while saving his passengers from the blaze, REN TV reported.The aircraft made an emergency landing at around .pm Moscow time on Sunday after bursting into flames mid-airOne passenger revealed: I was sitting in front of the engine, and saw how everything melted.Somehow I managed to reach the exit, inhaling carbon monoxide.The flight attendants said: Come on, quickly, crawl, a little bit left until the exit. As a result, I managed to jump off the plane.Passenger Pyotr Egorov described the plane jumping like a grasshopper as it touched down.We took off and then lightning struck the plane, he said.The plane turned back and there was a hard landing. We were so scared we almost lost consciousness.The plane jumped down the landing strip like a grasshopper and then caught fire on the ground.The two-year-old Sukhoi Superjet was forced to make the landing shortly after taking off for the Arctic city of Murmansk at .pm local time.A distress signal was issued before the radio connection failed just minutes into the flight.Witnesses filmed the rear of the plane engulfed in flames and black smoke as it touched down at the airport and sped along the runway ablaze.Aeroflot said the plane turned back for unspecied technical reasons and made a hard landing that started the fire.One source said the emergency landing was so hard that debris had found its way into the engines, sparking a fire that swtly engulfed the rear of the fuselage.The plane’s flight recorder shows the aircraft was hit lightning soon after taking off for Murmansk from Moscow.A spokeswoman for the Russian Investigative Committee announced that an investigation into the fire would begin soon.The planes chief pilot has been named as Denis Evdokimov and the co-pilot Maxim Kuznetsov.Tatiana Kasatkina and Ksenia Vogel were also among the crew members.Evdokimov said: “We lost radio communication because of a lightning strike. We did not have radio communications during landing.“We managed to resume it via an emergency frequency but it was abrupt and short.  We managed to say a few words and lost it. And we had to connect it again.“Air traffic control did help us, they guided us to the runway. The speed was not high, but normal for landing.“Everything was according to the book.  We gently approached the ground, slowing down.“After a complete  stop we ordered emergency evacuation.  The second pilot was the first to leave the cockpit, then I did.“At first I did not glance outside.  When I did, I saw a fire engine.“The fire began after landing. We were not on fire when in the air.”Footage emerged today of a ground team at Sheremetyevo laughing at the stricken plane as it landed in flames.Comments ranged from it being a landing with a bang toit landed like this then it means people [are] injured on board.Russian news agencies reported that the plane had been made in  and had been serviced as recently as April of this year.The SSJ, also known as the Superjet, is a two-engine regional jet put into service in  with considerable fanfare as a signal that Russias troubled aerospace industry was on the rise.The plane is largely used in Russia as a replacement for outdated Soviet-era aircraft, but also is used by airlines in other countries, including Armenia and Mexico.This is the second fatal accident involving the plane.In , a demonstration flight in Indonesia struck a mountain, killing all  aboard."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000208867439.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"hatton garden heist ringleader luxury homes sell","story":"Brian Reader had nearly completed the houses in his back garden but ran out of money.He had hoped cash from the £million robbery would help him finish them off.But he has been ordered to sell the plots as part of a court ruling that he must repay £.million from the raid or face being sent back to jail.The Court of Appeal also said Reader, , must sell his £, home in Dartford, Kent.The retired secondhand car salesman was jailed for six years for his part in the  Hatton Garden safety deposit heist.Reader, previously jailed for fencing gold from the  Brink’s-Mat robbery, was freed from prison last year after serving less than three years.His son Paul applied for planning permission in  to build the two four-bedroom properties at the back of Reader’s home.A neighbour said: “They began building a few years ago but all work has been stopped.“Apparently he wasn’t able to pay the builders and was hoping the money from the heist could have helped pay them off.”Last year gang member Daniel Jones, , got another six years’ jail for not complying with a £million confiscation order.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit.

But the source said Met Police officers could be investigating Ney without telling the couple.They said: “There has been work done on him in the past and they could well be focusing on him.”The McCanns’ spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: “We are simply not discussing operational details either in Great Britain or Portugal.

From that point on she was the perfect child. I would go home hoping she would be crying and awake, so I could walk her. I would walk her in the kitchen and listen to the refrigerator hum. It put her to sleep.“Or we would go outside — this was in Woodland Hills [in LA] — and we would look up at the moon.“I would point to the moon and say’ ‘This is Meggy’s moon’.“For two years I did this, to the point that after a while she would say ‘Meggy’s moon’.“That is something we did all the time. We were very close that way.”Thomas and Doria, , orced in  when Meghan was six. She went on to live with him when she was a teenager in high school in Calornia. It ensured a close bond between the pair — one that Thomas would dearly like to strike up with his newest grandchild.Thomas’s other two children, Samantha Markle, , who lives in Florida, and Thomas Jr, , from Oregon, have five kids between them spread across the US.Samantha’s eldest kids, Ashleigh, , and Chris, , both live in Virginia and have built successful careers as a lawyer and pilot respectively.Her youngest daughter Noel, , is studying sociology in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Thomas Jr is dad to Tyler, , who recently appeared on MTV reality show The Royal World and makes his living as a marijuana farmer in Oregon.His other son Thomas III, , lives with his husband in Mammoth Lakes, Calornia, and runs a branch of Domino’s Pizza.Samantha also spoke exclusively to The Sun yesterday, saying: “There is an amazing new baby in the world.“I have to say congratulations to Meghan and Harry.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college.

In the meantime, can I recommend you watch the actor-to-stuntman handover, about four minutes into tonight’s EastEnders, as a topless Keanu escapes down Louise Mitchell’s drainpipe ’Costhat segment doesn’t win the Best Comedy Weight Loss category, something’s gone terribly wrong at next month’s Soap Awards.Piers Morgan: “My collar size used to be  and a half, it got to  and I didn’t like it.”And who would, on their first day at school But let’s talk about the here and now, Chunk.A MAJOR shock during the final episode of Channel ’s absorbing Sunday night series Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.Rugby player Ben Foden voluntarily withdrew, during the interrogation phase, having been subjected to several hours of “disturbing and repetitive noises”.The one thing you’d think he was prepared for, after marrying one of The Saturdays.Whatever demons those ungodly howls awoke in Ben, they didn’t seem to bother Frankie Bridge’s husband Wayne, who’s been the obvious and deserving winner of the series since episode one.The final was still well worth an hour of your time, though, just to see the interrogation of Made In Cha’s Sam Thompson, whose endless backchat, sulking and general toddler antics went down every bit as well as you’d expect with the show’s battle-hardened Special Forces veterans.“Are you pulling a fookin’ face ” “No, Sir.” “Then stop being a fookin’ c*** then.”When verbal threats failed to register, the staff tried guilt-tripping him by menacing Victoria Pendleton with two alsatians.A tactic that probably went down badly with all those people who think the real SAS operates like a community outreach theatre group, pacying hostile forces through the medium of dance and mime.Personally, I thought the whole series was so brilliantly executed it should become an annual fixture, with celebrities forced to do it at gunpointnecessary.And,anyone disagrees, just try telling me you wouldn’t like to see Gemma Collins shoved out of a helicopter backwards.THIS Morning, April , “The woman who can predict the future by throwing asparagus”, Jemima Packington: “Meghan’s going to have the baby by the end of April. Twins, one boy, one girl.

It was disgusting.It felt like a prison cell.

The only place to wash up was in this tiny bathroom sink next to the toilet. The shower was just horrible.“The worst was the fleas and bedbugs. They were in the carpet and the bed.”All three were repeatedly bitten by fleas with little Rio especially affected and developed a rash while staying in the room.Shannon said: “I hated it.

It is a safety net that’s in place to protect the most vulnerable homeless households.It is not suitable accommodation for the long-term and is exactly why we have invested in building our own temporary accommodation stock.“When a complaint is made about a hotel, the homeless team will investigate to ensure it reaches the standards we expect and so far this year we have stopped using two hotels as a result of these inspections.If we find that a complaint has merit, we will address this with the landlord andrequired, alternative accommodation will be offered.“An environmental health officer visited Smithy’s Hotel on Thursday and agreed with the owner a number of changes that must be made immediately.Moving forward our temporary accommodation team will be visiting this property on a monthly basis .”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/NINTCHDBPICT000279127982-e1557168719249.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry upbringings","story":"The Duchess of Sussex gave birth to a boy weighing lbs oz. He is seventh in line to the throne after his father.T hey were born  , miles from  each other – and a whole world apart in social standing.Huge, cheering crowds and the global media gathered outside St Mary’s Hospital in London on the day Prince Harry was born.But when Rachel Meghan Markle arrived into the world in the early hours of the Queen Mother’s st birthday, only her father Thomas had been there to celebrate.Meghan’s mum Doria was still anaesthetised from giving birth by caesarean to a healthy baby girl who would later make history as the first American to become Her Royal ­Highness.But that morning — August , , — as he cradled his tiny daughter in the austere delivery room at Canoga Park Hospital in Los Angeles, Thomas Markle could scarcely imagine the le that lay ahead for her.Thomas, then  and a successful Hollywood lighting director, recalled: “I was the first person in the world to hold Meghan.“When they handed her to me and I held her in my arms for the first time it was love at first sight. She was the most beautul baby.“Meghan winked at me and I fell in love and have never stopped loving her from that day forward.”Fast forward to September , , and in the private Lindo Wing at St Mary’s in Paddington where Princess Diana, the world’s most ­famous woman, gave birth to her second son.He was spare to the heir and third in line to the British throne.According to Diana, when Prince Charles was handed his newborn child he took one look at the baby and said: “Oh, God, it’s a boy — and he’s even got red hair!”The Prince of Wales had secretly wished for a girl.Diana later revealed: “I knew Harry was going to be a boy because I saw on the scan. Charles wanted a girl.”In the street outside the Lindo Wing, the Sun’s royal photographer Arthur Edwards was on a -rung ladder to see over the heads of the throng waiting for news of the birth.Buckingham Palace press secretary Vic Chapman came out and shouted so everyone could hear: “The baby’s name is Prince Henry of Wales but he is going to be known as Harry.”Arthur says: “When Prince ­William was born we’d had to wait ten days to find out his name, and with Princess Beatrice it was almost two weeks before the official announcement.”Just  hours after giving birth, Diana stood on the hospital steps with baby Harry in her arms.He was wrapped in a shawl that hid his ginger hair.When Arthur’s pictures of Diana and her boy were printed in the next day’s Sun, the headline read: “Wild About Harry”.Arthur says: “It’s a name that fitted him perfectly and the world has been wild about him ever since.”In contrast, when Meghan’s mum was well enough, Thomas and Doria, then , slipped almost unnoticed out of the hospital and drove their baby to her new home in the LA suburb of ­Woodland Hills.Thomas recalls: “My greatest joy was coming home from work, picking her up and just walking back and forth in the kitchen, holding her in my arms.“She would listen to the hum of the refrigerator and it would lull her to sleep.“My other favourite memory is of walking outside with her in the garden. I would point to the moon and say: ‘That’s Meggie’s moon’.“I did it for so long that eventually she was able to look up at the sky, point and say ‘Meggie’s moon’.”Harry and older brother William spent much of their early childhood in the apartments in Kensington Palace and at Highgrove House, the Gloucestershire estate Charles bought in .At Harry’s christening, Diana claimed Charles told the Queen: “We were so disappointed — we thought it would be a girl.”But his mother told him: “You should realise how lucky you are to have a child that is normal.”Arthur Edwards says: “Diana was very protective of Harry, more so than with William.“I remember being invited twice to go to Kensington Palace to photograph William but never once with Harry. To this day I don’t know why that was.”Diana had threatened to boycott a five-week official tour of Australia and New Zealand in  unless William — then less than a year old — accompanied them.But the next time they went Down Under in , the boys did not join them.Ahead of the tour Harry, then just over a year old, posed for a set of cute pictures, including playing the piano, which hit the right note with fans all over the world.A few months earlier, Harry had been the star of the show when in May , the princes travelled on the Royal Yacht Britannia to Venice to meet Charles and Diana at the end of a -day tour of Italy.Arthur says: “Harry never went on an official tour as a baby like William. But they did a photocall on the deck of Britannia where Diana looked delighted to be reunited with her baby son.“It was the first time we really saw Harry’s red hair, which runs in his mother’s family, the Spencers.“A couple of days after Diana had gone home with the baby, I was covering a story with Princess Michael of Kent and she said: “Oh, I’ve seen the baby. He’s ginger’.“Apparently Diana was upset by that and said, ‘He’s not ginger, he’s fair’. But Princess Michael was spot-on. There were always requests for pictures of Harry when he was little.But demand was easily ­satisfied because every term when they started nursery or school we would go along. When Harry first went to nursery, one of the other boys said to the teacher, ‘Why can’t I bring my dad to school like Harry’s dad ’“Of course, it was Harry’s royal protection officer. Bulletproof glass was put in the school for protection but other than that he led a relatively normal le as a boy.”Diana always claimed that after Harry was born, her marriage began to fall apart and Charles drted back to his mistress Camilla Parker Bowles — now his ­second we.By the age of eight, Harry’s ­parents’ ­marriage was over when the Queen ordered the warring Waleses to orce.In Los Angeles, Doria Markle quickly ed to work as a make-up artist after the birth to help the family’s finances and Meghan spent her early years brought up by her doting grandmother, Jeanette Ragland, who lived close by.Family members say Thomas Markle’s marriage to Doria was already under strain when Meghan was born. By the time Meghan was three, her parents had split and she was six years old when they orced.After the split, Meghan’s now-estranged dad Thomas remained part of her le.He says: “I would see her all the time. I had her every weekend. We lived close and Meghan went between the two homes ­happily.”As an adolescent, Meghan moved in with her dad when she attended an all-girls’ Catholic school. After school, he would pick her up and take her to the set of the sitcom where he worked as a lighting director.But her uncle Joseph Johnson says his half-sister Doria, who will be closely involved in bringing up Meghan’s baby, was the biggest influence, teaching her daughter that whatever happens in le she will always know she is truly loved.He says: “I think she’ll be a great grandmother,she helps raise that child anything like Meghan was raised. Meghan was never hit or hollered at.”For ten years, Carolyn Robb worked as chef to Charles and Diana and was close to Harry as he was growing up.She says: “Harry’s very caring and gentle. Even as a little boy, he’d always want to know how you were.“He’s also a lot of fun. There was mischief in there as well.

For Harry it must be like  Christmases coming at once.And Meghan has taken the interaction with children that Diana began to a whole new level.As an actress and showbiz star she has been interacting with the public for many years — and she is a natural with kids.Just recently in Morocco, though heavily pregnant she crouched down low and stayed talking to a little girl for ages, oblivious of the strong sun.And surrounded by the rest of the Royal Family at Westminster Abbey on Commonwealth Day in March, she made a beeline for a delighted young girl, squatted down and made her feel so special.When they do walkabouts, Harry often has to wait for her because she is so busy speaking with people, old and young.Meghan always poses for pictures with kids. Even when they are behind railings she makes a huge effort to get down and chat through the fence to them.When the public see Harry with a child of his own, it will go some way to making them feel that the -year-old boy who walked behind his mother’s coffin in  has come out the other side.There is no doubt in my mind that following Diana’s funeral cortege at such a young age did affect him in later le.I remember going to a rather fractious Palace briefing ahead of the funeral and people asked the question of whether William would walk behind the coffin. No one assumed Harry would.We almost got the impression it was not going to happen but the reason it did was because Prince Philip said to William: “If you walk, I will.”That persuaded him to do it and, of course, Harry went as well.I will never forget the sound of people sobbing their hearts out as the coffin went by — and then a woman stood near Westminster Abbey called out: “God bless you, Harry.”Not God bless you, William. God Bless you, Harry.I imagine along that route, which was extended because of the huge crowds, many people would have said the same and that the ordeal endeared him to everybody’s heart.This month my own son turned . As long as I live I will always remember the moment I first saw him in his cot.It was one of the greatest experiences of my le and Harry has now experienced that same special feeling.I am confident Harry and Meghan will teach their son how privileged they are to be a member of the Royal Family and not to waste the opportunity to do good.Go out there, Baby Sussex, just like your grandmother Diana, and make everybody, especially children, feel important.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My goodness what an amazing grandmother she would have been.Also, her experience of le as a high-profile royal and mum would have been so valuable to Harry’s new we. In my opinion, Princess Di and Mother Teresa of Calcutta were the two most important women of the s and s.In time, Megan and Harry’s little boy will learn everything about the wonderful granny he never met.As a child Harry was a gentle soul. Prince Charles described him as the one with the gentle nature.He slept through the night, ate everything that was put in front of him and was extraordinarily good.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was already three months pregnant when she and Harry arrived in Sydney in October last year for their Commonwealth tour and announced there would soon be a Baby Sussex.Meghan wanted to do every one of the  engagements planned in Australia, New Zealand, Tonga and Fiji, with the enthusiasm that has become her trademark.Keeping up her yoga-inspired exercise regime, interspersed with regular meditation, her energy was boundless and she was feted wherever she went, clutching Harry’s hand and cradling her bump.Meghan’s celebrity friends, barrister Amal Clooney, tennis ace Serena Williams and fashion stylist Jessica Mulroney, have all juggled motherhood with high-flying careers.Inspired by her ambitious friends and her American work ethic, Meghan will almost ­certainly want the intellectual ­stimulation of her royal duties as soon as possible.Evenshe is not seen in public straight away, it has been suggested that her first public appearance might be Trooping The Colour on the Queen’s official birthday, ­Saturday, June . Her own mother, Doria Ragland, ed to her work as a make-up artist soon after Meghan’s birth and managed a career alongside motherhood, with her mother Jeanette Johnson looking after baby Meghan while Doria was at work.In the States, new mums are often back at their jobs within weeks as maternity leave is unpaid and usually lasts only up to three months.Perhaps that was why, while ­married to film producer Trevor Engelson, Meghan reportedly made him agree thatshe became ­pregnant, he would provide a nanny and a personal trainer to help regain her figure andto her job as a high-profile actress as soon as ­possible.Feminists Meghan and Harry have never felt the need to conform, so the idea of posing for snaps on the hospital steps was never going to be on their ­independent agenda — and their decision to keep their baby’s arrival private is nothing new.When the Queen gave birth to Prince Andrew in Buckingham Palace on February , , a -word statement was hung on the Palace railings by her medical team. It was more than a month later, on March , that there was any further news — and the infant’s name, Andrew Albert Christian Edward, and the first photograph of mother and child, taken by Cecil Beaton, was released.An extra-strong bond of love and affection unites a couple at this moment and Meghan and Harry are right to want to keep these precious early times to themselves, rather than share them with the world as William and Kate managed so well, but Diana did not.Shortly after posing for pictures on the hospital steps after William’s birth in , Diana burst into tears of exhaustion as soon as their car left the front of the hospital and she subsequently suffered from post-natal depression.Harry and Meghan’s modern way of thinking is in tune with all childcare manuals both ancient and modern.Meghan’s determination to do things her way began when she selected her own female-led birthing team, leaving the royal gynaecologists who oversaw Kate’s three births to take a back seat.  “Calm and relaxed” being the key words, whatever plans Harry and Meghan have for a gender-neutral nursery, meditation, gongs and wellness, it all makes senseit helps them.At a conference for International Women’s Day in March, Meghan recalled watching a documentary on feminism in which a pregnant mother said: “I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that.” said Meghan. “Boy or girl — whatever it is — we hope that’s the case!” Meghan and Harry will obviously raise their child with progressive beliefs. It is likely Baby Sussex will feature heavily on Instagram.  Savvy social media operator Meghan could subtlety use her and Harry’s official site to plug her ­feminist ideas and hints on how she is raising their new arrival.Their interest in “wellness” was confirmed when they spent more than two hours at healer and spiritual philosopher Denise Leicester’s flagship store Ilapothecary, in ­London’s Notting Hill Gate last month.Wellness, chanting, crystals and healing are nothing new to Harry. When he was a child, Diana had her Kensington Palace home rearranged on the advice of a feng shui expert and practised yoga, healing and meditation and the ancient art of Chinese medicine.As we have seen from countless photographs, Prince Harry is a ­natural with kids.Now he has his own, he will be a hands-on father involved in every aspect of baby le. Meghan’s unconventional childhood and Harry’s more traditional upbringing could not be more dferent, but they were both instilled with love, kindness and “a sense of self and the importance of helping others”.Meghan was taught by her mother Doria and Harry by Diana, who took eight-year-old Harry and his brother to a homeless refuge to witness a side of le in total ­contrast to theirs.Diana insisted her boys should lead as normal a le as possible and took them shopping, to the cinema and to the local McDonald’s.The annual event to mark the Queen’s official birthday falls on June  this year — when their son will be just over a month old.Last year Kate attended the same spectacle when son Louis was just seven weeks old.Harry and Meghan are also already planning their first post-baby overseas trip. It will be an autumn tour to their beloved Africa, but it is not knowntheir baby boy will travel too.We revealed last month that Harry and Meghan have discussed with other senior royals what their roles might be after the birth of their first child.Our report told how the talks involved a possible move to Africa for four months each year.Conservation and human rights are issues close to both their hearts and South Africa and Botswana were understood to have been discussed as potential bases for the couple.Just last week we also revealed that Meghan was looking at buying a Los Angeles home for the family near to her mum Doria.Harry was as conscious of his privileged start as Meghan was of her humble beginnings, and the two will complement each other as parents. Together they should provide a balanced existence for their son.  In the US, child rearing is dferent, and Meghan will believe that praising the child in front of others and encouraging them to talk about their talents will make them stronger in the adult world.Harry might have the opposing, English view of his mother, who never bragged about her children or talked about their achievements, as she considered modesty to be good manners and an important part of the learning process.Harry joined William at Ludgrove boarding school in Berkshire, aged eight, then went to Eton College, where he struggled with his studies because of his dyslexia. Meghan was also privately educated but sailed through her schooling, ending up at Northwestern University.  Their child may eventually attend one of the several nearby American schools, but I doubt Eton will be a consideration.Both Meghan and Harry realise employing a nanny will be essentialthey are to continue their philanthropic workand, as much as they might want to bring up the baby by themselves, it will be impossible.They have registered with a top nanny recruitment agency in ­Kensington, rather than using a nanny trained at the prestigious Norland College in Bath as the Duchess of Cambridge did. The ­couple also have not ruled out an American candidate or male “Manny”. The nanny was the bedrock around which royal parenting existed for years and both nanny and royal parenting have evolved.In the past, royal children were seen and not heard and never ­accom­panied their parents on toursDiana changed all that and took the infant Prince William to Australia and New Zealand — an example followed by Kate and William years later.  Baby Sussex might well be toted around the globe on Prince Harry’s back and I am sure he will be taught about the things close to Harry and Meghan’s hearts — the ­dangers of climate change, the importance of conservation and how to help others and honour your own self-worth.Whether or not they choose for their children to be involved in royal duties, or follow the example of the Princess Royal and reject titles and keep them out of royal le, remains to be seen.  I think they will be encouraged to do royal duties and help their ­cousins George, Charlotte and Louis. And whether or not they take the traditional route towards upbringing as the Duchess of Cambridge has, or opt for a more laid-back LA lestyle, is another ponderable.Although in the US the English are regarded as barbaric for sending their children away to boarding school, the snob appeal of an English education and manners are still much sought after. Harry’s first nanny, Barbara Barnes, achieved the remarkable feat of having both him and William sitting up straight before their first birthdays.They said please and thank you almost as soon as they could talk.She would not allow them comfort blankets and refused to put their little feet into shoes until they had learned to walk properly.  And when they did get their first pairs of footwear, she insisted on classic Start-rite shoes with straps that were shaped to the boys’ feet. Trainers were banned.Whether or not Meghan will agree with all these sensible but old- fashioned ideas we do not know.  Prince Harry will certainly be a hands-on parent.  He will be sharing the night shts as they get up to comfort Baby Sussex and both will be changing the endless nappies.His concern for his we is all- encompassing and he will want to be sure she has enough rest, while he takes on baby duties. Not because he has to, because he will want to.  Although their lestyle might appear lavish, Meghan has worked very hard since becoming married to our favourite, Prince Harry, and as a mum deserves to be allowed to do things her way, ­without criticism.If that means travelling to the wilds of Africa or across the Commonwealth with their child, they should have the freedom of choice to do so.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that has enraged MPs on both sides of the ide, who fear their leaders will compromise on key issues - and split their parties. So whataposs on the table, why is there a row, and what does it mean for Brexit  Hereaposs your snap guide. Labour and the Tories are trying to agree a unied approach to Brexit that can pass the House of Commons, ensuring we leave the EU by October . Labouraposs key demand is for the UK to enjoy a customs union with the EU, something Theresa May previously said she would not accept. This would mean we could do away with customs checks on any goods travelling from or to the EU - including across the Irish border. Weaposd have to stick to the same tarfs system as Brussels, and that would stop us striking out with our own trade deals around the world. Labour is also demanding alignment with the single market, and the adoption of future EU standards on workersapos rights and the environment. And the party wants a Boris lock - legislation that ensures these promises canapost be unpicked by a future Tory leader once Theresa May resigns. Meanwhile, scores of Labour MPs want the party to demand a confirmatory referendum - allowing any deal thataposs agreed to go to a public vote. But thataposs the subject of a major row .  Either weaposre days away from a deal or itaposs all close to collapse. Details were leaked of a possible aposfinalapos offer from Theresa May to Labour. According to reports, the PM would stop short of Labouraposs call for a permanent customs union with the EU - instead offering a temporary one to , the date of the next general election. She was also set to offer to align with EU single market rules on a wider range of goods, and enshrine all future Brussels workersapos rights laws in the UK. International Development Secretary Rory Stewart talked up a deal, saying the parties were a quarter of an inch apart and we agree on % of this stuff. But the leak incensed Labour and came after weeks of pessimism from party aides. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said he did not trust the PM and insisted Labour still wants a permanent customs pact. That leaves big question marks over whether Theresa Mayaposs offer will be acceptable to Labour, and whether a deal will get over the line.  Not necessarily. EvenJeremy Corbyn and Theresa May agree, there is no guarantee their plan can win a majority in the House of Commons. While itaposs unlikely to suffer defeats on the scale of Mayaposs original Brexit deal - because this time Labour will be on board - there are rebels on both sides. Labouraposs rebels are in twocamps. Some want to stop any Brexit, and others will accept a deal but onlyitaposs put to the public in a referendum. Tory rebels are furious at the idea that Theresa May could compromise and offer a customs union - a soft Brexit. Together these two groupscould scupper a deal and weaposd be back to Square One.  There are nearly  Tories who voted down Theresa Mayaposs Brexit deal. Of these, just over  are hardline, hardcore rebels. Most of this big group are Brexiteers who believe her original Brexit deal was too soft. Their fears revolved around a clause called the aposIrish backstopapos, which was essentially a temporary customs union between the UK and EU. So of course reports of a new compromise - involving, errr, a temporary customs union - have sent jitters through the Conservative Party. Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson urged MPs to walk back to something in the middle because we need to get Brexit done. But Nigel Evans, hardline secretary of Tory MPsapos  Committee, warned more than  Tory MPs could never support a customs union. Tory MP Lee Rowley added: Stop this madness. People didnapost vote for you to do a deal with a Marxist.  A huge chunk of Labour MPs have demanded a second referendum - a confirmatory vote letting the public choose between the deal and Remain. If Jeremy Corbyn fails to secure this, they could refuse to back him in Parliament. More than  opposition MPs,  from Labour, publicly demanded the British people have the final say to avoid a Westminster stitch-up. Andreported the final total who could refuse to back a deal without a second referendum could be far higher, at  to . The issue has caused ructions as the top of the Labour Party, including in its Shadow Cabinet and ruling National Executive Committee. Deputy leader Tom Watson and Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer are among those believed to want a aposPeopleaposs Voteapos. And Shadow Brexit Minister Matthew Pennycook has told MPs there is a clear need to seek “public approval for any agreement. But other shadow Cabinet ministers including Jeremy Corbyn are sceptical about a public vote and fear it will alienate Labour heartlands. Shadow Defence Secretary Nia Grfith warned a new public vote would cause all sorts of aggro while backbench MP Caroline Flint said: Across the North and the Midlands Labour took a hammering [in local elections]. Those people voted in the referendum, many Labour voters, and others beside, for Leave. We need to show we respect their vote otherwise they will not listen to us again. Will we get a second EU referendum   There are still huge doubts. Realistically, itaposs still not clear whether a second referendum has a majority in Parliament - no matter how loud the calls for it become. And a key step to holding one would be for Labour to demand it in talks with Theresa May. So far, itaposs been low on the priority list, and Jeremy Corbyn is well-known to be sceptical about a public vote. That said, key figures including John McDonnell, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, have publicly suggested a vote could be needed to find a way out of the deadlock. And the Dailyreported that the issue had come up in scenario planning by Downing Street. Will EU elections still happenthereaposs a deal   Almost certainly. The feeling in Downing Street is that itaposs too late to cancel the EU elections on May , evena deal is reached before then. That means Brits would elect  paid-up MEPs to the European Parliament. However, it is still possible that those MEPs would not take their seats, despite the election carrying a £million estimated price tag. That is because the Parliament only starts sitting on July . As soon as Brexit happens, Britainaposs MEPs will cease to be MEPs. Will the saga force Theresa May from office   Probably, in the end. The question is when and how. Mrs May has already promised Tories she will resign after her deal - the first phase of Brexit - is safely approved by MPs. But furious MPs want her gone soon whether a deal is agreed or not. Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader himself, said she must now resign or be forced out after the Brexit drama helped cost the Tories more than , council seats in the local elections. Geoffrey Clton-Brown, Treasurer of Tory MPsapos  Committee, said: Soon after [EU elections] would be time for her to think about setting a schedule to find her successor - regardless of whether there’s a deal or not. It’s time we should move on as Conservatives. She will face a grassroots no confidence vote by Tory activists in June. This is not expected to be binding but a survey found % of members want her gone.    Committee leader Graham Brady is reportedly planning to see the PM this week to demand a proper timetable for her departure. Will it destroy the Conservative Party   It takes a lot to do that. But many are talking about a party split.  Committee leader Graham Brady warned a customs union deal would “split the Conservative Party” and “must be resisted.” Minister Kit Malthouse told the BBC: The risk of a split has been around since the referendum and before. He added: “The idea of us being in some sort of permanent relationship without a say, I think, would be a dficulty for quite a lot of Conservative MPs.” International Development Secretary Rory Stewart even suggested a split in the Tory Party would be a price worth paying. He said: I think to get Brexit done, and to move this country on is worth an enormous amount, and youaposre right, we may have to take some short-term pain to do that.

Not long afterwards, the man who almost stole the show at their wedding, the Reverend Michael Curry tweeted: “The Jewish tradition reminds us that the birth of every child is a reminder that God is not finished with us yet. There is hope.” Every baby brings hope for the future, but this one brings more than most. It’s a lot of pressure to put on a baby that’s barely hours old, but Baby Sussex brings the kind of hope Britain needs right now as Brexit splits a nation in which there is ever more ision and ever more race hate. FOR LIVE UPDATES ON THE ROYAL BABY - CLICK HERE    Cast your mind back a year to May, , when Harry and Meghan were married at Windsor Castle. It was the most erse and inclusive Royal Wedding anyone had ever seen. Mother of the bride Doria Ragland, an African American woman with dreadlocks, held on to the arm of her daughter’s new father-in-law Prince Charles, the future king of England, as he walked her down the chapel steps afterwards.    Rev Curry delivered an unforgettable sermon which had senior members of the Royal Family trying to stle giggles. He spoke about slavery and quoted the late, great Martin Luther King Jnr. Then there was the incredible Kingdom Choir, led by the brilliant Karen Gibson. It was truly a historic occasion, where there was something for everyone. It was followed, a few weeks later, by the World Cup in Russia at which England did the country proud under the leadership of manager Gareth Southgate.  Again, ersity and inclusion were at the heart of the team. The Three Lions symbolised everything that was great about our modern country in a way they hadn’t done before. But, in the months that have followed, the warm fuzzy feeling has sadly become a distant memory. The optimism of last summer has been replaced by ision and fighting that sometimes feels like it’s never going to end. You can’t turn on the news, radio or even, dare I say, open a paper, without people arguing about the result of the  referendum and whether we should remain in or leave Europe.    Things are no better in America – which matters because Baby Sussex is half American after all. The optimism of the Obama White House, has been replaced by bitter conflict fuelled by Twitter-obsessed President Donald Trump. He presides over a country where black people, often unarmed young men, are still being killed by police and their families get no justice. A country where, when a white woman was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, her family was promised £.million in compensation. A country where Colin Kaepernick, the American footballer and political activist who kneeled rather than stood during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner to protest against racism and oppression, hasn’t played since .  But Baby Sussex hasn’t only been born into a world in which there are searing political and racial isions, he’s been born into a world undergoing unprecedented environmental change. Sir David Attenborough has called it “humanity’s greatest threat in thousands of years”. Last month, Extinction Rebellion brought parts of London to a standstill as they forced the issue of climate change on to the agenda. It’s the younger generation who are taking the lead in the fight against global warming. And Baby Sussex will be part of that generation, again hoping to change the word for the better.    Harry and Meghan have already proved themselves to be a thoroughly modern couple who do things “their way”, evenit means ruffling a few feathers. The charities that they’ve chosen to be associated with – from the Grenfell Tower tragedy to mental health – show they are in touch with modern Britain. So it may be wishful thinking, but wouldn’t it be greatthe birth of their son is able to reignite some of that wonderful spirit from last summer   That spirit which saw the whole nation cheer when Harry arrived with big brother Prince William and made his way nervously into St George’s Chapel as he awaited his mixed-raced American bride-to-be. Like the royal couple, we should be looking forwards not backwards and trying to make the country better for his generation. I, for one, look forward to seeing the baby pictures in a few days’ time. I can’t think of a better symbol of hope for modern Britain.

The future king took it all in his stride and scored a perfect hat trick.  Before he ed home to be reunited with his baby son, Charles enjoyed champagne with other players, grooms and detectives.

They offer le coaching and advice on everything from anxiety disorders to phobias, but nothing could help their own problem. Atopic eczema is very common, affecting one in every five children in the UK at some stage. Hunter, now , first developed the condition when he was six months old, and by his first birthday his whole body was covered. “It started on his hands, then moved into the creases of his elbows, backs of his knees, his face, legs, tummy,” recalls Eva, , from Littleborough in Greater Manchester.    “It was really hard to watch. He always had very disturbed sleep and was so consumed with itching and scratching that it had an impact on his social skills. He sat there not really interacting with the world because he was so distracted. He became introverted and his language development was ­definitely delayed by it.” The Speakmans, who also have a daughter, Olivia, , tried everything, from prescription hydrocortisone to homeopathy treatments. “As parents, we endeavoured to do everything and anything we could,” says Eva. “We covered him in creams, balms and ­bandages. I was bathing him in porridge oats. People would stop me in the street and suggest remedies because you could see it on his little face. “We took him off cheese and yoghurts, as dairy definitely made things worse. If ice cream touched his lips he’d get a big ring around his mouth. While he could eat oranges,the juice dropped on his skin, it was like it had burned him.” With the family at their wits’ end, their GP referred Hunter to a paediatrician specialising in dermatology. “I held out so much hope and really believed that finally we were going to cure him,” says Eva. “But I left the hospital in tears. The doctor had a look at Hunter, asked what we were doing, and after I described our routine he said, ‘Yep, you’re doing everything you can’. I couldn’t believe it. He simply said we could hope Hunter grew out of it. “Then out of the blue a friend called to say she had seen a doctor on TV who said he could help kids get over eczema.” It was July  and the ­Speakmans were about to go on a cruise from ­Southampton to New York, so Eva resolved to look up the doctor once they ed. “While we were on the ship a man saw Hunter’s skin and said, ‘Your son has eczema, hasn’t he  I could help him. Call me when you get home’,” says Eva. “It was only the same doctor my friend had seen on This Morning, Dr Richard Aron!    “It was the biggest ­coincidence. At that point, we had no idea he was going to change Hunter’s le.” Dr Aron bases his treatment on the theory that in most cases, eczema and dermatitis is caused by a bacterium called ­Staphylococcus aureus. Eva explains: “He gave us fucibet, an antibiotic cream I had to put on angry areas eight times a day for two days, then seven times over two days, then six – counting down until we were just using it twice a day. “Dr Aron also provided a lotion which uses the same steroids, ­antibiotics and moisturising creams as other doctors had prescribed, but he mixed them into one lotion, so we were using it in diluted quantities for longer periods. “Within a week we saw a massive improvement and within a fortnight Hunter’s eczema was gone completely. He would occasionally get small patches in the crease of his elbow, but we would use the cream and it would be gone again. “Now he’s a strapping, outgoing -year-old – you’d never know what he went through. Dr Aron’s my hero.”Eva and Nik Speakman will be part of This Morning Live events in May, including An Evening with The Speakmans on May  at NEC Birmingham. thismorninglive"},{"url":null,"title":"mum pleads parents vaccinate kids","story":"NewsMum pleads with parents to vaccinate kids after baby son almost dies from measlesMum Sophie Dale spent six days in hospital watching her -month-old son Levi fight for his le as he was to young to be vaccinatedShareCommentsByKelly-Ann Mills:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsLevi Dale was treated for measles at just  months \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum whose baby son nearly died of measles has warned about the dangers of failing to vaccinate - as new research warns of a apostimebombapos caused by  information online.

Levi was struck down by the killer disease a month before he was due to have his first jab. Sophie from Chesham, Bucks, said: Measles causes an onset of infections. It is le threatening. It is scary and my son could have died. Seeing my son in hospital was the most terrying six days of my le and I want all parents to know what could happen and what to watch out for.   She added: Some people think measles is just having a few spots and a fever but one in  children will develop very serious complications including encephalitis, convulsions, meningitis , deafness, bronchitis or pneumonia.I was baking Leviaposs birthday cake and preparing for his party when he began to have terrying convulsions. His face was swollen, his body was sore, he didnapost eat, he had the highest temperature Iaposve ever seen, he had seizures and he just stared unnervingly into space. Itaposs something no parent ever wants to see. He was blue lighted by ambulance to hospital and taken straight to the High Dependency Unit where he was checked and treated for sepsis , encephalitis, pneumonia, meningitis and a whole heap of other things.Intensive care was put on standby as my poor little baby had MRI scans, lumbar punctures, EEGs, cannulas, drips, antibiotics by the multitude and was sedated. He was hospitalised for six days and they were the scariest six days of my entire le.    He was prodded and poked left right and centre. I just wanted to scream at the doctors and nurses to leave him alone, but I knew they were saving his le. I was heartbroken about how scared and confused my poor baby must be. He wouldnapost have been able to understand why mummy - his protector - was letting medics stab him and jab him every  minutes with needles.

Health body Public Health England even phoned me at midnight wanting to know where Iaposd been and who I had seen to stop the disease spreading. It was then I realised how very serious a measles epidemic could be.    The effects have been ongoing as he has had to learn to walk over again but Levi has now had his MMR and is fully recovered.

Melinda Hornyak moved to the UK in  from Hungary and settled in Wales after falling in love with work colleague, David Brooks.They moved to Abertillery in  and soon welcomed the birth of their first child, WalesOnline reported .Mr Brooks tragically took his own le in March aged just .  All state welfare payments apart from child benefit of £ a week have been withdrawn from Ms Hornyak following his death. She is now having to rely on help from some members of the Labour Party in Abertillery and a local Christian organisation. She said: “I’m really in a terrible position. I live with my daughter in private rented accommodation and the rent is £ a month. For now the landlord is being lenient but obviously there will be a limit to that. “I was told by the DWP [Department for Work and Pensions] that as I hadn’t lived in the UK for five years I wasn’t automatically entitled to benefits. For about the last six weeks I have just been getting child benefit. “The DWP told me I should seek work – but my daughter is two and I want to look after her. If I went out to work I would have to pay childcare costs anyway.  “People are being very kind in Abertillery and I couldn’t survive without the help they are giving me. But I can’t expect them to carry on helping me indefinitely. “My daughter was born in Wales and I thought that as an EU citizen I would be entitled to help. I want to stay in Wales. “At the Jobcentre I was told about a Settlement Scheme and I’ve applied for that. But I don’t know what to expect and how long a decision will take.” Former Blaenau Gwent council leader, councillor Hedley McCarthy, said: “The way this unfortunate woman is being treated is an absolute scandal. “She has gone through an extremely traumatic time with the death of her fiancé and this is the very time she needs support. It seems cruel and heartless that she is left with virtually no money to live on.  “We are still a member state of the EU and it seems incredible to me that she is not automatically entitled to financial help in these circumstances. “A group of Labour Party members together with people who belong to a local religious organisation called New Le Community have rallied round to help her. But obviously that can’t be a long-term solution. “Everyone I have spoken to about the case is totally shocked at the callous way she has been treated. “She deserves to be shown compassion and treated with humanity.” Louise O’Connor, project manager for New Le Community, said: “We are doing what we can to help Melinda, who has been through a terrible ordeal. We’re giving her Tesco vouchers and nappies and wipes and have been in touch with quite a few churches who are being supportive.    “We’re also helping a Polish gentleman who has been here for more than six years and isn’t getting any benefits.” A DWP spokesman told WalesOnline: “Our thoughts are with Ms Hornyak at this dficult time. “Eligibility for certain benefits is based on a person’s permanent right to reside in the UK and we understand that Ms Hornyak has now applied to the Home Office to establish this. “Depending on this we can of course consider her claim and provide all of the support she may be entitled to.“Those eligible for Universal Credit can also get funding for up to % of their childcare costs to ensure work always pays.” Eligibility for EU citizens accessing benefits has not changed since  and remains the same as before the referendum, a spokesperson said. A statement on the European Commission’s website, written to explain the complexities of the situation, states: “EU law says that before EU citizens not active in the labour market become eligible for social security benefits they have to pass a strict ‘habitual residence test’ proving that they have a genuine link with the UK. This test has been agreed by all member states, including the UK, under this EU Regulation. “In practice, a signicant number of those who pass the habitual residence test have worked and paid taxes in the UK for a certain period or are living in the UK as a direct family member of someone working. “These criteria for assessing habitual residence are strict and thus ensure that only those persons who have genuinely moved their centre of interest to a member state are considered habitually resident there. This is a powerful tool for the UK and other member states to make sure that social security benefits are only granted to those who are entitled to receive them.  “Of course, in order to receive those social security benefits that are directly linked to a certainor value of contribution, EU migrants must also meet those criteria as well as the habitual residence test. “So reports that the European Commission is insisting that the UK should provide benefits for non-active EU migrants ‘from day one’ are quite simply untrue. “What is true is that the Commission, as it is legally obliged to do under EU treaties and rules to which the UK has signed up, has formally asked the UK to cease applying an additional ‘right to reside’ test specic to the UK and which goes beyond the habitual residence test agreed by all member states. “In many cases EU nationals living in the UK are indeed receiving the social security benefits to which they are entitled. But applying this additional right to reside test is depriving some other EU nationals living in the UK, in full compliance with EU rules and within the strict limits set by those rules, of social security benefits to which they are entitled. “In many cases, these EU nationals have worked and paid their tax and social security contributions in the UK, yet are still being refused benefits. “The fact that the UK continues to apply this test means that it is applying dferent criteria to EU nationals in the UK than those being applied to UK nationals resident where in the EU – of which there are up to two million according to some estimates.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry example first time","story":"NewsopinionPrince Harrys joyful announcement captured a first time dads aweHarrys delight at the safe arrival of his new son brings back memories for writer Steve Myall, co-host of the First Time Dads podcastShareBySteve MyallDeputy Features Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionPrince Harry is over the moon\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt doesnapost matter from what walk of le you come from, when you become a dad for the first time you beam with pride and boy was Harry beaming.

And with the Duke of Sussex confirming that the proud parents had welcomed a baby boy into the world early this morning the debate has intensied. Harry himself admitted the couple have had a little time to think about it with the baby overdue but that they are yet to settle on their choice. One royal commentator has said the new parents may choose a name that ties together both UK and US history. Speaking to CBS Victoria Arbiter said: “I don’t have an inside track on the actual name but I think when it comes to names we are looking at a very strong name because that is who Meghan Markle and Prince Harryare. For live updates on the new royal arrival follow our blog    “But I also think we are going to see a name that works on both sides of the pond. She added: When we come to boys Alexandra is the Queenaposs middle name, Alexander is the masculine form. “Alexander Hamilton is one of the founding fathers in the US. “So I think there are a lot of names here that work with the British Royal Family tree but also have strong roots in the US.”    Harry beamed earlier today as he spoke to the media from Windsor. He said: Iaposm very excited to announce that Meghan and myself had a baby boy this morning, a very healthy baby boy. A smiling Harry added: Mother and baby are doing incredibly well. It’s been the most amazing experience I can ever have possibly imagined. How any woman does that, what they do is beyond comprehension.    We’re both absolutely thrilled and so grateful to all the love and support of everybody out there, itaposs been amazing so I just wanted to share this with everybody. Still thinking about names but, yeah, the baby is a little overdue so we’ve had a little bit of time to think about it – but that’s the next bit. We’ll be able to see you in two daysapos time as planned and be able to share it with you as a family and share it with you guys and so everyone can see the baby.

The Instagram account, which was set up in early April when Meghan was already heavily pregnant with their son, has so far featured a series of photos of the couple at ious engagements.Even back then, rumours were circulating that they were going to use their new Instagram account to announce the birth of their child, and many believed that Meghan herself was in charge of the account . Meghan is known for being social media savvy. Before she became a member of the royal family, she had garnered over a million followers on her own Instagram account, and was used to hashtagging and posing up a storm for likes, so itaposs no surprise that she wanted a similar semblance of control over the announcement of her child.They still have a way to go to beat the likes of Kylie Jenneraposs baby announcement , or even the world record egg , but in under one hour the royal baby post is already approaching one million Instagram likes.As a social media fanatic myself, I think the move is a brilliant way of demonstrating a more contemporary side of the monarchy. The stylish dark blue background, coupled with Harry and Meghanaposs crest and a brief caption is a far cry from posing on the steps of the Lindo Wing - and shows that the pair have no intention of following in William and Kateaposs footsteps. Itaposs a proper introduction to Brand Sussex and a fitting welcome to the world for their newborn and I, for one, am here for it.

Rugby player Danielle now says that taking part in this yearaposs  Miss Swimsuit UK  has left her feeling empowered and confident, and even given her a new group of supportive friends. She told the Manchester Evening News she became intrigued after an Instagram post from competition bosses, featuring the motto aposbe confident, be you, be funapos, caught her eye. I never would have entered anything like this because I think there is a stereotype - but it was that motto, says Danielle.   Other competitions are about beauty and your shape, and obviously that plays a part, but the whole day was about empowering women and making friends for le. Iaposd love to be a part of something like that as long as it was about empowering people and when I spoke to the CEO she assured me that they wanted women to feel confident, and itaposs a fun thing. Danielle entered the competition without any expectations and was stunned when she went on to win the Manchester heat, which took place at Viva, in the city centre, last weekend. She says the competition has helped her with anxiety she developed as a child, when school bullies targeted her because of her mixed British and Indian heritage.    I was bullied at school, I was made to feel like I stuck out like a sore thumb, thataposs how kids made me feel, she says.    It wasnapost until my third year at uni that I realised that a lot of people would want to be my colour, and I started to embrace it. I had a lot of anxiety issues from school, but my boyfriend encouraged me to enter. When I was in the competition, I felt so confident and so accepted by everyone. I just want everyone to know that thataposs what it was about. I didnapost feel like the odd one out any more. Iaposm so humble and grateful that I won. Danielle, who plays rugby for Ormskirk, also wanted to prove that being athletic and feminine are not mutually exclusive.

What the baby is called According to Harry, the couple are yet to decide on a name for their son. Speaking this afternoon he said: The baby was a little bit overdue so weaposve had a little bit of time to think about [a name]. Thataposs the next bit. Who the medical team were When the Duchess of Cambridge welcomed Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, the notice posted on the easel outside Buckingham Palace was signed by the medical team who delivered the baby.  However this was not on Meghan and Harryaposs notice. It simply read: The Queen and the Royal Family are delighted at the news that her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex was safely delivered of a son at  today. Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.

As a baby she was diagnosed with ­bicoronal craniosynostosis, which prevents the skull and brain from developing normally. Surgeons have had to take apart her skull and put it back together in a series of ­procedures totalling  hours in . But the brave tot has shown such courage through it all that her family have adopted the motto “be more Evie” for tough times.Proud mum Jacky, , said: “The surgeons had to reshape her head, and afterwards they described her skull as looking like crazy paving. They had to take three-quarters of it out and put it all out on a table and then put it back together again to reshape her skull.“When the surgeon came to see me after her final operation he seemed thrilled at how well it had gone. There was this look of pride on his face, which was really reassuring.”    Amazingly, Evie was up and about playing peek-a-boo just  hours after the last -hour operation last September. Jacky, from Hull, East Yorks, added: “She’s just incredible and a real superstar. “She has a wound from one ear to another but nothing fazes her. She’s awesome. Every time they operate they use the same wound. “We were worried that she might get self-conscious about the wound when she’s older, so we got zigzag tattoos on our wrists so we have one too. “She has no fear, but I was terried having to hand such a precious piece of me over to some strangers to cut her open. “But they have saved her le – and now she’s unstoppable.” Evie was diagnosed after medics noticed something was wrong with the shape of her head after she was born. The skull is made up of several “plates” of bone which, at birth, are usually not tightly joined up and are supposed to gradually fuse together. But Evie’s condition meant the soft spot on her head and lines that usually fuse together when babies are about a year old had already done so before birth.    This prevents the skull and brain growing normally. Jacky recalled: “A nurse weighing her when she was a baby told us her head was flat at the back because we were letting her sleep too much on it. “But we knew that was not right because we’d been really careful about how she slept, making sure there was never any ­pressure on her skull. “When she was finally diagnosed by the paediatricians, I was petried. I thought we were going to lose her.” Evie was five months old when she had her first operation, which involved surgeons putting cranial screws into her skull to give her brain room to move. The springs were removed two months later in a second operation. Her third time in surgery at Leeds Children’s Hospital was her biggest op yet, lasting for a ­gruelling  hours. Her mum said: “After her last surgery she was on the high-dependency unit and her eyes were swollen shut. “My heart broke, it was so scary seeing her like that. She couldn’t see at all – but hours later she was up and playing.” Between operations, the plucky toddler has had regular blood and eye checks, as well as tests with behavioural psychologists studying her development. Jacky, who also has nine-month-old son Jayden, said: “She’s like a Peppa Pig-loving child prodigy, and so advanced for her age. “She has a wonderful bond with Jayden. After her second surgery [when Jacky was still pregnant with Jayden] she could feel him kicking when I was holding her. It was like he was cuddling her too. Now they are so close.”  Relieved Jacky was also full of praise for the dedicated medical team who she says have saved her daughter’s le. She said: “During the operations she has had up to five surgeons and each one has played their part in saving her le. Without them her brain would not have been able to grow. “I want everyone to know how they have saved Evie and how wonderful and absolutely amazing our NHS is.” Mike Richards, clinical director at Leeds Children’s Hospital, said: “We are very pleased to hear that Evie is doing so well following her procedure at Leeds Children’s Hospital. “This is a real testament to the skill and expertise of our surgeons, and the great care of our clinical teams, who do such a fantastic job for all their patients. It is my hope that Evie will now go on to live a fulfilling and active le.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk facing vaccination timebomb more","story":"NewsUK facing ‘vaccination timebomb’ as more young parents turn to anti-vax sitesAround  per cent of young mums and dads with kids under the age of five say they read anti-jab scare storiesShareCommentsByGemma Francis:,  MAY NewsSophie Dale is campaigning for parents to give their children the MMR jab\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Experts are warning the UK could be facing a ‘vaccination timebomb’ as more young parents turn to anti-vaccination sites online.Research revealed half of parents – including  per cent of those under  - feel the so-called ‘anti-vaxx’ movement is becoming more influential.A signicant  per cent of young mums and dads with children aged five and under – the age when most vaccines are administered – admit reading anti-jab scare stories , compared to  per cent of parents overall. Currently, just over half of parents carry out their own research before deciding whether to vaccinate their child, the study for UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and parenting site  ChannelMum  found.Worryingly, only  per cent trust the current range of official information available, with  per cent believing information is ‘promoted by drug companies’. And one in five actively search out alarmist vaccine stories as part of their research while one in ten has a ‘anti-vaxxer’ friend they discuss immunisations with. The study also showed young parents are more likely to view anti-vaxx sitesthan talk to their midweabout having their child immunised. Dr Helen Bedford, Professor of Children’s Health at UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health said: “While the majority of parents are happy to vaccinate, the rapid rise of anti-vaccination scares on social media is causing many to now question the need for vaccines.    “Due to a long-standing successful vaccination programme, as a nation we have forgotten the terrible toll these diseases can take on children. While the anti-vaccination sites may concentrate on perceived side-effects, they don’t show the real and often le-changing impact of catching a disease we vaccinate for.” According to Unicef, , children in the UK are currently unvaccinated against disease including measles. The charity has blamed a recent global surge in the potentially-fatal disease on plummeting vaccination rates.The study showed the main source of anti-vaxx stories for parents is Facebook , with  per cent of UK parents viewing material there. One in  looked up the misleading material on picture-sharing site Instagram .Overall, one in five parents say the anti-vaxx movement has made them less likely to vaccinate their child. One in seven also admit to ‘questioning the need to give vaccines’, soaring to quarter of young mums aged  and under. Two in five also believe fewer people are vaccinating compared to five years ago. The poll of , parents carried out via OnePoll also revealed a third of parents confess they don’t know which diseases the standard UK immunisation program protects their child against. However, three in five parents believes children should be banned from attending school or nurserythey have not been vaccinated.   Siobhan Freegard, founder of  ChannelMum said: “When it comes to vaccinations, there has been a breakdown in trust between some parents and the authorities - but it will be children who pay the pricethey are not vaccinated.“While it’s essential voices on both sides of the debate are listened too, we have to examine the reasons why parents are prepared to put their child’s health at risk  There needs to be an honest debate on all sides about what we can do better. ‘Your child, your choice’ is a common parenting mantra, but not vaccinating can have implications far wider than just your child alone.” Mum Sophie Dale is campaigning for parents to give their children the MMR jab after her son Levi almost died from measles aged just  months. Although initially unsure about vaccinating, she decided to inoculate the tot after carrying out her own research. However, Levi was struck down by the killer disease a month before he was due to have his first jab. Single mum Sophie, , from Chesham, Bucks, said: “Measles causes an onset of infections. It is le threatening. It is scary and my son could have died. “Seeing my son in hospital was the most terrying six days of my le and I want all parents to know what could happen and what to watch out for. Levi first caught measles in November last year, just before his first birthday. It wasnapost until days later that he suffered with complications as a result of the disease.“Some people think measles is just having a few spots and a fever but one in  children will develop very serious complications including encephalitis, convulsions, meningitis , deafness, bronchitis or pneumonia.“I was baking Levi’s birthday cake and preparing for his party when he began to have terrying convulsions. His face was swollen, his body was sore, he didn’t eat, he had the highest temperature I’ve ever seen, he had seizures and he just stared unnervingly into space. It’s something no parent ever wants to see.“He was blue lighted by ambulance to hospital and taken straight to the High Dependency Unit where he was checked and treated for sepsis , encephalitis, pneumonia, meningitis and a whole heap of other things.“Intensive care was put on standby as my poor little baby had MRI scans, lumbar punctures, EEGs, cannulas, drips, antibiotics by the multitude and was sedated. “He was hospitalised for six days and they were the scariest six days of my entire le. “He was prodded and poked left right and centre. I just wanted to scream at the doctors and nurses to leave him alone, but I knew they were saving his le. “I was heartbroken about how scared and confused my poor baby must be. He wouldn’t have been able to understand why mummy – his protector – was letting medics stab him and jab him every  minutes with needles. “He would be crying for me when I wasn’t allowed in the room for some procedures. He spent his first birthday in hospital attached to machines and I was terried he would lose his spark and never smile again. “Health body Public Health England even phoned me at midnight wanting to know where I’d been and who I had seen to stop the disease spreading. It was then I realised how very serious a measles epidemic could be. “The effects have been ongoing as he has had to learn to walk over again but Levi has now had his MMR and is fully recovered. “Our experience shows vaccinations shouldn’t be feared. They save lives. There are so many posts online about encouraging parents not to vaccinate and claiming is causes autism and cot death. Please learn from Levi and I and please vaccinate your children.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast britain bask","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Britain to bask in hot summer - but it could be a VERY wet oneForecasters have warned we could be in for some grey and miserable weather across over the next few months - but its not all bad newsShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAY NewsBritons could be in for a wet summer this year \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis yearaposs summer will be hotter than usual for Britain - but forecasters have warned it could also be a VERY wet one.Temperatures will hover above average but will be accompanied by wet and windy conditions, according to a prediction by the Weather Company.The picture for the next few few months does not bode well for sun-worshippers.

According to the Met Office’s three-month forecast, temperatures are looking to be above average as the summer months move closer. Forecaster Alex Deakin said: “The longer range, three-month outlook is suggesting that higher pressure is more likely than lower pressure, and higher temperatures are more likely than lower temperatures. “A trend towards some finer weather as we go into early summer, but of course, any inidual spell of hot weather can’t be forecast at that kind of range. ”The trend does look drier than average.”  WeatherOutlook’s Brian Gaze also said the UK could see temperatures up to C as soon as this month. He said: “C would not be a surprise later in May, with warm air, known as a Spanish plume, expected to arrive from southern Europe.” While there is a lot of cynicism about dramatic forecasts, the Spanish plume is a thing. Ms Smith said: “The Spanish plume does exist and there is a good chance we will have higher than average temperatures through to July.

Ryan Longstaff, , spent four days exploring the , sq mile contaminated area last April with three pals. They ate army rations and camped out in homes which were abandoned after the  nuclear accident. The -year-old, from Newcastle upon Tyne, managed to get access to the zone after contacting two Ukrainian guides who know how to breach the siteaposs security. Ryan, a credit controller, and his group met the guides in Kiev on  April and travelled  miles north to the abandoned former No.  Soviet nuclear city.    The group then hiked seven miles in the dark and spent the night in the attic of an abandoned cottage in neighbouring Kopachi. The next morning, they set off on another five mile walk to reach Pripyat, the ghost town on the Ukrainian-Belarus border, and found a derelict high-rise apartment where they bunked for the second night. Ryan woke at am to watch the sunrise from the top of the building before exploring iconic ghost locations including Pripyat City Prison, the Azure Swimming Pool, Middle School No. , and Cheburashkaapos Kindergarten No. .    After resting, the urban explorers reached an administrative block located around two miles from the Chernobyl reactor for their last evening. On  April, the group made their way back to the pickup point nearly  miles away, and took a ride back to Kiev, where the first thing Ryan did was have a shower. Over the four-day adventure, Ryan lived on army rations, which consisted mostly of tinned beef, protein bars, noodles, chocolate rice, and tea and coffee, made by boiling water using a bunsen burner-type his tour guides smuggled into the Zone.    Ryan said the nights were so cold,  plummeting to -C,  that he would sleep in three layers - coat, jumper, tracksuit bottoms, thick socks - in his sleeping bag. He added that despite the conditions, the Chernobyl trip is one heaposll never forget. It was just an unbelievable experience -- a once-in-a-letime trip, Ryan said.  Going to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone was something that Iaposd always wanted to do - but you have to do it properly, and go into the parts they cordon off. Chernobyl was frozen in time - it was like history had stood still, in the s. The Zone was so eerie, but it really took your breath away. I was lost for words at times - I think the pictures speak for themselves.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas arrives at loch fyne sea angling club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAfter a series of weather related cancellations, Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club finally held its Christmas and combined league outing on Saturday February .While conditions were challenging on Loch Etive, it proved to be a fun day.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp.

This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

his possessions to fund a two-year volunteering mission across Africa and has ed with a renewed sense of perspective.During his travels across Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda Dominic witnessed violent election riots, contracted Malaria and suffered a iety of broken bones having fallen down a storm drain.Dominic, who is , told the Border : ldquoWe really donrsquot have any idea of how others live on the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a cafeacute selling food to the public.Dominic fully embraced the lestyle of the local community, enduring the same daily struggles faced by the local population.ldquoI experienced what it was like to have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered. He said: ldquoThe best part was seeing the smiles and laughs of the people I helped.ldquoThey were grateful and happy, and because I lived like the majority of the people in the slum they made feel a part of the community - I really did feel like it was home.This sense of community was demonstrated when a newly born child was named after him, an experience which left Dominic ldquospeechless and overwhelmed.The experiences of his spartan existence during his charitable travels, and the positivity of communities with so few of the things we take for granted, have shaped Dominicrsquos attitude to le since ing to the UK in March.He added: ldquoAfter selling most of my things to help fund this mission I now own very few items and the ones I do own I appreciate more.ldquoI appreciate things

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage. If that work was done before construction starts, then that would be useful.ldquoIt would be the best option to make sure this is all in place before any work starts.Councillors voted to approve the application, with the exception of Galashiels and District councillor Sandy Aitchison, who voted against."},{"url":null,"title":"junior-choir-delights-with-anniversary-show","story":"REVIEWBy Revd Pamela StrachanEddleston Junior ChoirAN exploding lsquoTreble Clefrsquo culminated an evening of joyous music from the Eddleston Parish Church Junior Choir last Friday evening, as Musical Director, Lorraine Mulholland, cut the spectacular Pintildeata cake.Baked by one of the Junior Choir mothers, Teresa Bedford, the fabulous cake was a fitting tribute to  years of this little choir bringing its vitality and exuberance to worship in the church.As well as giving regular concerts over the years, the young singers have raised money for charity, made their own CD and brought joy to the elderly in residential homes in Peebles.The choir has also been the starting point for many talented young musicians who have gone on to become accomplished young soloists, as we heard on Friday evening.The programme began with a touching performance of lsquoHumility  Appreciationrsquo from The Little Triangleand was followed by solo pieces from past choir members.After learning the piano for merely a year, young Izzy Steele gave a confident performance of two solo pieces, along with a duet of Bobby Shafto.Izzy already plays with great expression as the audience heard Bobby cheerfully setting sail but then becoming queasy with seasickness only for his spirits to lt as he heads for home once again.Very competent performances followed by both Jenner Brownand Shona Sinclairas they demonstrated how participation in the Junior Choir has fostered their talent and love of music.Jenner played lsquoRussianrsquo by Martrei Blanter, Blue Dayand Allegro Assai rd Movement from Concertino in D Major by Ferdinand Kuchler.These pieces would have been a challenge for older players, but this young violinist played with great panache.Shona Sinclair gave a similarly spirited performance on the piano with Branle de la Torche by Michael Praetorius, Shadows by Walter Carrol and the lively Scott Joplin number, The Entertainer.Rowan Steele, older sister of Izzy, delighted the audience with her performance on fiddle, with Farewell to the Glenand A Set of Shetland Reels.Rowan and Jenner then performed together on violin and fiddle with The Love of the Islesand Stomach Steinway Man, written by Ian Lowthian who was born in the Scottish Borders where he still works as a music teacher and educator.The ten young singers who currently make up the Eddleston Junior Choir produce a lsquobig soundrsquo and sing with such obvious pleasure and enthusiasm.The Lemonade Kid by Peter Fardellgave them all scope for their exuberance, as did their repeat performance of A Midsummer Nightrsquos Dream by Kane and Kane.We were treated to this at the summer concert last year and such was the choirrsquos obvious delight in performing this number, we were told they requested to sing it again.That seems to be the secret of this young choirrsquos success all the young members thoroughly enjoy the singing and performing, the rhythm and the sheer pleasure of making music.Delighted parents in the audience confirmed how much their children enjoy belonging to the choir as Lorraine Mulholland was presented with bouquets and warmly thanked by the Reverend Calum Macdougall for her  years of dedication and commitment to so many young singers in Eddleston and Peebles.The Church, parents and the Eddleston community all owe a huge debt to this inspirational Musical Director and music teacher."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-stories-set-for-borders-book-festival","story":"INSPIRATIONAL stories will told at this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

In areas where pollution exceeds legal limits,  per cent of harmful nitrous oxide gas comes from transport.ldquoOpen Streets is a great initiative to make our city centres healthier, greener and safer places for everyone.Friends of the Earth Scotland said the initiative would show people living in the capital what they are missing out on by allowing cars to dominate and pollute public spaces.The charityrsquos air pollution campaigner Gavin Thomson said: ldquoBy giving more people the freedom to walk and cycle safely, we can cut air pollution, reduce our climate emissions and make Edinburgh a better place to live and work.ldquoEdinburgh council should be praised for leading the way in tackling air pollution by getting to the heart of the problem, which is traffic.The councilrsquos ambition is to gradually shut a loop of the Old Town by the end of the -month trial which could include Cowgate, Holyrood Road and Johnston Terrace.Officials are also looking at plans to ban the most polluting vehicles from the whole of Edinburgh in a low emission zone .A proposal was already in place to introduce a LEZ in the city centre, but this would extend the zone to the entire capital.It comes after mounting pressure on governments to take action on climate change, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon declaring a ldquoclimate emergency in her speech to the SNP conference last week.Earlier this year, Glasgow established Scotlandrsquos first permanent low emission zone. This currently only applies to buses but will be extended to cover all vehicles over the next few years.While the city council has no current plans to sign up to the Open Streets movement, a spokesman said: ldquoWe are currently developing responses to an independent Connectivity Commission, which identied a case for liveable public spaces that prioritise people and active travel."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor   Cybernats    and extremists represent the worst of times","story":"Written in , harking back to Francersquos Reign of Terror, it is also a sobering reminder of what can happen when nuance is removed from public discourse.

They already turn to online support such as BBC bitesize and YouTube when they are revising. They seem to be able to cope with this and itrsquos them doing the learning so maybe itrsquos us holding them back Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said the use of technology was helpful, but some schools currently had dficulties with broadband.She said: ldquoSome schools continue to have poor internet access, even in areas where connectivity should be good, and there remain serious connectivity issues in several communities around Scotland.ldquoThis impacts on the ability of schools to use everything that the internet has to offer. We donrsquot have a level digital playing field and this really must be sorted out.Susan Quinn, convener of the education committee of the Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union, warned that the technology should not be used to replace traditional face-to-face teaching.ldquoWe recognise that this sort of remote teaching is being used in rural areas, but we have concerns about that being rolled out to a wider group. It really should be for distance situations rather than just because a council cannot recruit a teacher, she said.ldquoHaving  pupils in a class in Glasgow being taught through a video link by a teacher in a classroom with another  pupils in front of them is not something that we think is workable or practical. The best way of improving opportunities for pupils in a range of subjects is to recruit specialist teachers.Laura Gordon, headteacher of the Highland Virtual Academy, said the technology worked well with no negative impact on results.The initiative, which uses a video conferencing app, was established three years ago to enhance the curriculum for schools across the Highlands.Ms Gordon said: ldquoWe have lots of smaller schools on the north and west coast that donrsquot have the same provision as our larger schools because they just donrsquot have the staffing.ldquoWe wanted everyone to have access to all the courses available in our larger schools so the virtual academy was set up. We now have up to  pupils studying courses and we have  applications for next year.Under the model, the academy runs a set programme of National, Higher and Advanced Higher courses every year.They have found class sizes work best when there are no more than  pupils logging in to a session to allow teachers to fully interact with everyone logged on.So far results have been just as good as face-to-face lessons ndash and in some cases outcomes have been even better.ldquoEngagement with pupils is good because pupils are under the spotlight more, the class sizes are smaller and all the learning is collaborative and active so there isnrsquot an opportunity not to engage. Some of our results last year were better than faceto-face teaching, but the pupils have to have the independent learning skills in order to benefit from it.Last month, a report by the Reform Scotland think-tank found the number of National  and National  qualications on offer is in decline.A majority of schools now only offer six subjects in the fourth year of secondary school compared to eight or nine a few years ago.In contrast, private schools are continuing to offer up to nine. The Scottish Government argues Curriculum for Excellenceprovides greater flexibility and allows schools to design a more tailored education for pupils ndash including courses that donrsquot necessarily result in formal qualications.Because more pupils are staying on until sixth year, ministers argue that gives them more time to study qualications as they move up through school."},{"url":null,"title":"analysis-e-learning-not-just-for-rural-pupils-it-can-help-tackle-urban-squeeze","story":"They ended up teaching the class through a clunky Skype system and managed to get the pupils through their exams, but director of education Bernard Chisholm thought that,it had worked in this limited way, a larger scale pilot project should be set up, looking at a range of subjects which were proving dficult to staff to enhancesubject choice for pupils in smaller schools.Read more:Schools urged to embrace YouTube generation to plug subject gapsHe approached the Scottish Government and Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig for grant funding and set up a pilot project for our digital school, essentially withtwo people and two computers.That was how e-Sgoil came into being. The initial plan was to servicedemand in the Western Isles, but this soon changed as we wereencouraged to provide a service for pupils further afield wherethere was a need for digital learning through the use of our video conferencing facilities.Our first request came from Aberdeen City and this was to keep Gaelic classes going.Without remote teaching, the pupils would have had to drop out of their SQA courses.We employed a teacher and, between us, developed an online, real time, interactive style of teaching which worked very well with that group of pupils.Since then we have built on this style of teaching and expanded to include  local authorities throughout Scotland.We have taught a range of subjects including modern studies, chemistry, physics, English, biology, Gaelic, Spanish, mathematics, music and German at ious levels from the early years of secondary right through to Advanced Higher.The main driver in terms of this taking off in the Western Isles was the desire for equity of provision. Since the inception of e-Sgoil, pupils in small rural schools are now able to access subjects such as Higher Psychology that have not been available to them throughinteractive teaching in the past.But e-Sgoil is not just for schools in rural settings. In addition to Aberdeen, we have schools in semi-urban areas asking us to teach courses because teacher shortages are not just confined to remoteareas.We are now teaching over  pupils across Scotland. While we would never claim that this option is any better than having a teacher in front of a classroom, we would contend that having a good teacher delivering a lesson in this way can be as engaging as having someone in class.This is not about replacing teachers but about utilising teacherseffectively, either in class or to teach remotely. This is not acheap option. This is about real-time, interactive teaching, using highly-skilled people to give pupils a quality experience.At a time when we are facing teacher shortages, the e-Sgoil approach gives pupils the opportunity to learn subjects of their choice from specialist teachers.Angus Maclennan is headteacher of e-Sgoil"},{"url":null,"title":"teenagers-ej-carroll-and-katrina-lambert-to-speak-at-un-on-scotlands-human-rights-record","story":"EJ Carroll and Katrina Lambert, both , will give evidence on Scotlandrsquos human rights record to the Committee on Monday, supported bythe Childrenrsquos and Young Peoplersquos Commissioner for Scotlandin their roles as Human Rights Defenders.The evidence session will inform the Committee as it prepares to examine the UK Government on Tuesdayover where the UK and devolved governments currently fail to meet international human rights obligations.Focus on Scotland will include the Committee hearing about the age of criminal responsibility, the use of restraint and seclusion in schools, physical punishment of children and the use of so-called mosquito devices.Ahead of speaking to the Committee, EJ Carroll, who is from Midlothian, said: ldquoChildren and young people have the right to be included and our views taken seriously at the highest levels when it comes to issues that affect our lives.:Leonard urges Holyrood to recapture radical spirit of devolution on th anniversary of first electionsKatrina Lambert, from Edinburgh, added: ldquoHaving young people at the heart of the UN is absolutely crucial.

Toxic air pollution will just be moved from city centres to residential streets.ldquoThatrsquos why we need to see ambition from Edinburgh council - a large zone, covering the whole city, which includes all vehicle types.But a spokesman for motoring group IAM RoadSmart said he was unconvinced.Scotland-based policy and research director Neil Greig said: ldquoAn LEZ across the whole city seems a little draconian as it will inevitably cover areas that do not have an air quality problem.ldquoThe council should bring forward clear evidence that every location in the whole city is suffering before they put forward sanctions and control.ldquoRestrictions on older cars will hit the poorest residents who often live in the peripheral estates."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9815222.jpg?type=article-full","title":"meghan-markle-goes-into-labour-with-first-child-reports","story":"The couple announced the news on their Sussex Royal Instagram page on Monday afternoon.Speaking from Windsor, the Duke of Sussex said: ldquoIrsquom very excited to announce that Meghan and myself had a baby boy this morning, a very healthy baby boy. style\" background:#FFF border: border-radius:px box-shadow:  px  rgba, px px  rgba margin:  auto max-width:px padding: width:.% width:-webkit-calc width: auto\" display:block height:px margin: auto -px position:relative top:-px width:px\"LoadingBuckingham Palace confirmed the child was safely delivered at .am on Monday morning.Meghans motherDoria Raglandis said to be\"overjoyed\" by the arrival of her first grandchild and is with the Duke and Duchess at Frogmore Cottage.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced they were having a baby on  October , five months after their wedding.Harry and Meghans baby will be seventh in line to the throne and the Queen and the Duke of Edinburghs eighth great-grandchild, and a fourth grandchild for the Prince of Wales.:Scottish mothers share their home birth experiences as Meghan Markle prepares for hersThe babys sex will be a surprise for the couple, who have chosen not to find out what they were having.Ahead of the birth, the duke and duchess made a personal decision to keep the arrangements private, amid speculation they had opted for a home birth at their new home Frogmore Cottage, close to the Queens Windsor Castle home.Theysaid they will only share the news of the babys arrival once they have had a chance to celebrate privately as a family.Meghan was last seen on an official engagement on March  when she signed a book of condolences in London with Harry for the victims of the Christchurch terror attack.The American former actress and the duke moved into their renovated home Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor Estate at the beginning of April, as they prepared for their babys arrival."},{"url":null,"title":"royal-baby-how-the-line-of-succession-looks-now","story":"The first six places remain unchanged ndash the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis and then Harry ndash with his baby sonentering the line of succession below him.But the youngest member of the Windsor family has now bumped Harryrsquos uncle, the Duke of York, from seventh place down into eighth.:Meghan Markle gives birth to a boy, Buckingham Palace confirmAndrew was once the spare to the heir, and was second in line when he was born in .Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and th place, and the Earl of Wessex ndash the Queenrsquos youngest son ndash drops out of the top  for the first time to th in line.The Princess Royal, the Queenrsquos only daughter, who is often dubbed the hardest working royal, is now th in line behind Edwardrsquos son and daughter.The new royal baby will not in future require the monarchrsquos permission to marry.:Scottish mothers share their home birth experiences as Meghan Markle prepares for hersFor hundreds of years, the Royal Marriages Act  required descendants of George II to seek the sovereignrsquos consent before they wed, otherwise their marriages were deemedinvalid.But this law wasrepealed through theSuccession to the Crown Act.It restricted the consent to just thefirst six people in the line of succession, but as the new baby is seventh in line, they will never need to seek a monarchrsquos approval to wed.King George III,George IIrsquos grandson, had ordered the now repealed  act after his youngerbrother the Duke of Cumberland secretly married Lady Anne Horton, deemed to be ahighly disreputable widow of a commoner."},{"url":null,"title":"boris-set-to-visit-scotland-in-his-bid-to-woo-scottish-tories-and-boost-chances-of-succeeding-may","story":"Conservative sources said the former Foreign Secretary was due in Aberdeen at a fund-raiser for the cityrsquos Conservative Association, which he promised to attend when he was at the Foreign Office. It is suggested that Ross Thomson, the MP for Aberdeen South, who is a keen supporter of Mr Johnsonrsquos, is helping to organise his colleaguersquos visit.Reports at the weekend suggested Ruth Davidson had \"banned\" the former Secretary of State from giving a speech at the Scottish Conservative spring conference in Aberdeen.Party insiders claimed he had approached the party leader telling her: \"You and I are the future of this party,\" and that he had earmarked the conference as a  to build support for his leadership bid.Potential leadership rivals Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary, and Sajid Javid, the Home Secretary, did address conference but Tory officials insisted Mr Johnson had not been snubbed, pointing out how Matt Hancock, the UK Governmentrsquos Health Secretary, had also offered to attend but was also turned down.Ms Davidson, a Remainer, who famously challenged Mr Johnson over Brexit during a TV debate during the referendum campaign, has played down her Brexiteer colleague winning the Tory crown. She told STV: ldquoRemember that not everyone that people talk about being the frontrunner makes it to the starting line.\"However, it is thought thatthe London MP can get into the final stage of voting between two candidates, who are then voted on by the party grassroots, he could win.Last autumn, Scottish Tories not well-disposed to Mr Johnson launched \"Operation Arse\". At the time, one senior party figure noted: ldquoWe called it that so wed all be clear who we were talking about.\"Asked about the former London Mayorrsquos venture to Scotland this week and what he thought of him, one Scottish MP said: ldquoWe will take every opportunity to promote the success of the Union. The Conservatives are a broad church, who believe in One Nation values unlike the separatists.Another said: ldquoBoris is welcome in Scotland at any time. The former Mayor of London is assured a warm welcome to the north east.But a third noted: ldquoThe problem Boris has is that he has shown so little interest in Scotland or the Union in the past. He has never addressed the Union in any speech or interview that I have ever read. Sometimes he comes across as more of an English Nationalist than a Unionist. Certainly, in recent times he has repeatedly sided with the more Nationalist of my Conservative colleagues in the House.

As a Scot himself, he lsquogetsrsquo the Union, itrsquos more than just words with Michael Gove. He clearly sees that we need to see positive change come about to strengthen the United Kingdom.Mr Thomson was asked about Mr Johnsonrsquos visit to Aberdeen but declined to comment.Last month, Nicola Sturgeon suggested a Johnson premiership would send support for Scottish independence ldquosky-rocketing.The First Minister said: ldquoBoris Johnson as PM would send not just people in Scotland but many people across the whole of the UK into utter despair because Boris Johnson, not single-handedly but largely, is responsible for the complete mess the UK finds itself in."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-government-signs-new-brexit-consultancy-contracts-totalling-almost-160m","story":"Several are due to run until April  that is, six months after the UKs new scheduled departure date from the EU at the end of October this year.Following the  vote, consultants were hired to carry out a number of tasks to prepare for Brexit.In February, analysis found UK ministers had agreed consultancy contracts worth more than poundm at the time, the civil servantsrsquo union described the amount as ldquoeye-watering\".The Cabinet Office has now published a new round of contracts with consultants.Some nine firms awarded contracts last year such as Ernst  Young and Deloitte have had them extended for another year while another  have been given brand new contracts.Documents show they are being paid between poundm and poundm each for such things as accounting and auditing work as well as computer and management services.A Cabinet Office spokesman said: \"As a responsible government we have, and will continue to, draw on the expert advice of a range of specialists to deliver a successful and orderly exit from the EU.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a-mysterious-maned-lioness-at-the-centre-of-scotlands-national-show-at-the-venice-biennale","story":"The lioness, known by the title SaF, but also nicknamed Mmaomoriri or hairy princess, and the artist Charlotte Prodgers personal search for her in Botswana, is at the heart of the film which will be unveiled today.The new \"absorbing, enduring and deeply affecting\" work, a  minute film by the  Turner Prize winning artist, is named after the rare lioness in a work which forms Scotlands artistic contribution to the th International Art Exhibition at the Venice Biennale.Described as the artists most \"ambitious work to date\", is is being shown in a former boatyard, the historic Cucchini shipyard, revamped for Prodgers installation, in the Arsenale Docks of the famous Italian canal city.The art work uses archive footage, diary films and scientic imagery as well as the footage Prodger is known for: films recorded on her smart phone.The film is the official Scottish show at the festival, which brings together dozens of shows from countries from around the world: this year, the official UK Pavilion is also staging work by a Scottish-based artist, the Glasgow-based artist Cathy Wilkes.Prodgers film is -

He openly accused her of having ldquojeopardised the talks for her own personal protection.His colleague Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, cautioned about giving ldquo hope on this itrsquos going to be very dficult to find a negotiated settlement.Any compromise will lead to a split in both the main parties.It has been claimed a majority of Labour MPs would not back a compromise deal unless it was subject to a confirmatory public vote.

The public, she suggested, were fed up and just wanted to get on with leaving the EU.Today in a room in Whitehall, David Lidington for the Government and Sir Keir Starmer for Labour will lead their respective teams to try to bridge the gap, which we are often told is not that great, to find a Brexit compromise.Yet this looks like nothing more than extending the transition period from December  to May  when voters, at what will inevitably become a Brexit General Election, will choose between the Toriesrsquo vision of a customs arrangement and Labourrsquos of a customs union.Of course, one of the many groups who will not like this is the Scottish Conservatives as it might suggest UK fishermen having to stay in the hated Common Fisheries Policy until December  ie more than six years after people voted to leave the EU.A Con-Lab compromise will, of course, have consequences.A third of the Tory Party will be up in arms at Mrs May having ldquocaved in to Labourrsquos Marxist-Leninist leader and reneged on a key Brexit promise that Britain would take back control to do its own trade deals.On the Labour side, we are told some two-thirds of Mr Corbynrsquos MPs would defy their leaderno confirmatory public vote were attached to a compromise something which hitherto has been anathema to the Leader of the Opposition.Plus, just to make things even more unsettling for Mrs May, the inscrutable Tory grandee Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the  backbench committee, is due to turn up in Downing St later today to urge Mrs May to ldquoname the day of her departure.It will not be long off.If Mrs May cannot seal a deal with Mr Corbyn, she has offered indicative votes. Remember them. MPs, of course, were unable to back any of the options. The PM has said she would abide by the Commonsrsquo choice but onlyher Labour counterparty did likewise. He might not agree. And like last time MPs might be unable to coalesce on a way forward.Having faced a humiliating local electionsrsquo drubbing, Mrs May - now used to humiliation - is facing an even bigger one later this month in the European elections. I can already see the grinning face of Nigel Farage.Mrs Mayrsquos survival after another electoral drubbing and without a Con-Lab agreement in her pocket looks impossible.

I want it to work in the best interests of the whole of the UK. That’s why I was in Aberdeen yesterday to discuss this directly with businesses.I want to explain why I think this ambitious and pro-business blueprint will drive up wages and boost the Scottish economy.We will scrap the cap on the number of skilled professionals who can come to Scotland. We will also abolish the outdated requirement to advertise jobs in the UK for a month before hiring from overseas for highly skilled workers.This means that hospitals, oil rigs, banks, tech firms and other organisations will be able to access the talent and skills they need from all corners of the world.As part of our new system, we will widen the definition of skilled workers to allow more people who will add value to our businesses and economy to be eligible to enter. Anyone with the equivalent of Scottish Highers will be eligible to apply under the new skilled workers route.: Why Scotland must create ‘friendly environment’ for migrants – leader commentAnd there will continue to be no limit on the number of international students who can come to study at Scotland’s world-class universities – such as St Andrews, which was ranked in the UK’s top three universities just a few days ago.It’s vital we have a constant pool of foreign talent coming into the country, which is why we are introducing measures to make our universities even more attractive for prospective students. Under the new scheme, undergrads and postgrads studying at Scottish universities will be able to stay for six months after finishing their degrees to find work. Those who have completed a PhD will be able to stay for a year.As part of this ambitious plan, we are speaking to businesses, employers and partners right across Scotland to listen and ensure the new immigration system works for them. Yesterday in Aberdeen, I spoke to business leaders from the thriving industries of energy, fishing and agriculture. We’ve met hundreds of stakeholders so far this year, and we will have met thousands by the time we introduce the new immigration system in . We’ve also set up advisory groups, involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Universities Scotland and others. We have had detailed discussions about how this will work in practice.Although  may seem like a long way off, I’ve already made changes to make the UK more welcoming since becoming Home Secretary a year ago. I removed the cap on doctors and nurses coming to the UK so our NHS could recruit as many as they need – creating thousands of extra places for other sectors too.: Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon brands Theresa May ‘disgraceful’ after EU immigration commentsI announced reforms to help the most innovative entrepreneurs and investors come to Scotland and where in the UK. And I’ve made it easier for top architects and international researchers to bring their expertise.We’re also making it quicker for tourists arriving at Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports to enter by introducing by the summer of this year e-Gates for travellers from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States, which allow visitors to pass quickly and securely through border controls.We remain a truly welcoming nation – and that welcome extends to the more than , EU nationals who have made Scotland their home. We’re helping to protect their rights through the EU Settlement Scheme, which we have made as easy as possible to use.These people are our friends, neighbours and colleagues. We want them to stay and are doing everything in our power to get it right.Scotland also has a proud heritage and has a long history of being an open and welcoming nation as well as a trading nation. It exports products which are in global demand, from Scotch whisky to Scottish salmon and much more. I believe the new immigration system will help Scotland invest in the skills it needs to continue to thrive, driving productivity because it is built around the skills that people bring – not where they come from. It will have fairness and compassion at its heart, and I am confident that it will ensure Scotland continues to prosper for many years to come.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why requiring two referendums on independence could boost yes vote dr alan renwick","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has set out her plans for another independence referendum. Debate is naturally raging on whether people want such a vote. Equally important is another question: If Scotland#s constitutional future is to be reopened, how should the decision be made The First Minister’s statement suggests that she has learnt important lessons from the painful experience of Brexit. She wants to avoid deep ision and enable informed choice. To pursue this, she made three concrete proposals: cross-party talks a citizens’ assembly and new rules for future referendums. Having run the first ever UK-wide citizens’ assembly, on Brexit, in , I know the power of this approach – it’s a hugely important and valuable step.Let’s hope too that the new referendum rules address the major gaps in UK-wide legislation that allowed a torrent of manipulative campaigning to go unchecked in .Another key Brexit lesson is that sometimes one referendum is not enough. : Indyref and   Expert says two Scottish independence polls neededBrexit and Scottish independence share the same structure: a referendum is held on the principle only then do negotiations begin on putting that into practice. Holding just one referendum in such cases denies voters the right of informed consent. While some voters will back independence or the union come what may, the decision of others depends on the terms of independence – yet they are forced to choose before these are known.The best way around this is to plan from the start for two referendums: first on the principle second on whether people still want to go ahead with change once the details are known. That was proposed last year by the Independent Commission on Referendums and earlier this year by the Council of Europe.There have traditionally been two objections to this approach. The first is that requiring two referendums would weaken Scotland’s negotiating hand: the UK Government would deliberately offer a bad deal, hoping voters would reject it. : UK Government ‘polling Scots on Scottish independence support’But Brexit shows it is deluded to suppose that a deal of such massive importance could be signed off without thorough democratic scrutiny in some form at the end of the process. Second, nationalists worry that it’s harder to win two referendums than one. Butvoters know there will be a second ballot, they are much more likely to vote Yes at the first: many will take the chance to see what’s on offer. And a Yes vote first time round could build momentum for the second. Exactly this process underpinned one of the deepest transformations of a democracy in the last half century, when New Zealand’s voters decided over two referendums in   to switch their voting system from Westminster-style first-past-the-post to the much more consensual Scottish-style additional member system or AMS.Two referendums are needed for the decision to be democratic. And a democratic decision is neededNicola Sturgeon’s hope of holding the country together is to be fulfilled.Dr Alan Renwick is deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College London©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2 and 3 expert says two scottish independence polls needed","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Scottish Government should explore the possibility of holding another two referendums on independence or risk repeating the mistakes made by Westminster over Brexit, a constitutional expert has claimed. Two polls – a first on the principle of independence and a second on the terms of any separation deal – would allow voters to fully grasp what it was they were being asked to support, Dr Alan Renwick of University College London said.The academic said that staging two votes on the matter would not necessarily make it harder for the Yes campaign to win, as the momentum generated by winning the first poll could be carried into the second.But the process would allow voters to have their say on the final deal reached by the Scottish and UK Governments – meaning they did not have to be “locked in” to the result of the first vote.Critics of Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposed Brexit deal have long argued that it bears little reality to what most Leave supporters had voted for.Dr Renwick said a double referendum would have allowed UK voters the chance to weigh up Mrs May’s deal with the status quo.“A decision is democratic onlypeople have the information they want when deciding how to vote,” hesaid.“Some voters will be for or against independence come what may. But for others the choice will depend on what each option actually looks like – they therefore have a right to information on this. “Voters should not be bound, after negotiations have produced a clear plan, to the choice that they made before the options were clear. “This is the logic that Nicola Sturgeon rightly uses when she says that Brexit would constitute a material change from what voters were told in  would happen in the event of a No vote. The same logic applies the other way.”The First Minister said last month that Scots should be given the opportunity to vote again on independence before the next Holyrood elections in .The SNP leader told MSPs that she would introduce legislation soon to set the rules for another vote but suggested she would need the agreement of the UK Government before actually holding a referendum.However, at the Scottish Conservative spring conference over the weekend, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said that an agreement would not be forthcoming.But Dr Renwick said any preparations for Indyref were a chance to “bake in” the idea of a double referendum.“It’s fine to hold a single voteit is clear what you are voting for,” he added.“What’s dferent about Scottish independence and Brexit is that these are issues where you can’t work out the \u2028details until after a referendum.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them - actually it is the UK Government that is providing this and leading the way on budgets.”He hinted that more Scottish MPs would be handed ministerial roleshe replaces Theresa May“We shouldmake sure the Westminster government is seen as representative of every part of the United Kingdom and we’re prepared to energetically say to the SNP ‘You don’t speak for Scotland.’”“The whole idea that you say you are the Scottish Government and therefore you are the only legitimate voice that speaks for Scotland is wrong.“Of course we respect the devolution settlement and we respect their capacity to make policy as long they have a majority.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish parliament at 20 how have our first ministers fared","story":"In its  years the Scottish Parliament has had five First Ministers, each of them leading, failing and succeeding in very dferent ways, finds Gina DavidsonIt is highly unlikely that Donald Dewar ever considered himself to be the founding father of a new Scotland.Certainly his elongated, angular frame would have rebelled against the weight of any such pretension and his inclusiveness as a politician would see him point to others as being far more influential.But without doubt, Dewar was key to bringing devolution to Scotland, and creating the Parliament in which  MSPs sit today.It was he who took the Labour Party into the Scottish Constitutional Convention in , who was a doughty defender of the additional member voting system for the election of MSPs, and it was he who said everything that wasn’t specically reserved to Westminster, should be devolved.He was a driven man, taking on many constitutional fights within his own party, because according to his friend and one time special adviser, Wendy Alexander, he “was not a sectarian politician. He felt that it was important for the Parliament to be seen as not a tribal payoff to the loyalty of Labour voters, but a constitutional advance for the nation as a whole.”That was apparent when he agreed that the Scotland Bill, which would create the Parliament, would include no barriers to potential independence it ensured thatAlex Salmond and the SNP would be on board for the devolution referendum campaign in .: How PR gave smaller parties a big voiceDewar had a vision and he single-mindedly pursued it. And on May ,  he became Scotland’s first First Minister with his opening speech on the first day of the Parliament showing the direction of travel he desired. MSPs, he said, should never lose sight of why they are in Parliament – “to do right by the people of Scotland, to respect their priorities, to better their lot and to contribute to the common weal.”Even the design of Holyrood’s debating chamber, a semi-circle, was important to show that Scotland would do politics dferently to Westminster it was a desire for a more consensual approach, which came to fruition when Labour and the Liberal Democrats worked together in the first Scottish government. But his new administration was quickly embroiled in an access-to-ministers scandal, the Holyrood building fiasco and the repeal of Section . As he himself admitted the first year was “towsy”.And sadly he did not see the Parliament embed itself in Scottish culture, with his untimely death in October . He was always going to be a hard act to follow. In hindsight Henry McLeish was perhaps not the man to attempt it. To this day he is the only First Minister who has had to resign from the office.The son of a miner, a brief spell as a footballer was overtaken by town planning and politics and be became then a Fe Labour councillor, before heading to Westminster.McLeish worked with Dewar as a minister in both the UK and Scottish governments and as devolution minister from -, had helped pilot the Scotland Bill through the Commons. He remembers the early days as being about “building structures, building processes, building networks, very much nuts and bolts stuff in terms of the actual facility of the parliament itself.”So when Dewar died he was regarded as a “safe pair of hands”. But unfavourable comparisons were never too far away: where Dewar was cerebral and a fierce debater, McLeish was regarded as plodding and mocked for his mangling of the English language.However, he still masterminded Scotland’s historic scheme to provide free personal care for the elderly and skilfully handled the outbreak of foot and mouth, which caused a crisis of confidence in farming.His downfall, when it came, was financial. He thought it was an “honest mistake” that for  years he had received an income from letting his constituency office, while at the same time claiming office expenses. His inability to resolve the “officegate” scandal ultimately forced him to stand down, though he still described his actions “as a muddle, not a fiddle”.The resignation of McLeish was concerning to those who believed in the devolution project. Perhaps concerns that it would just be a bigger council, a talking shop and no more, were true Jack McConnell – the third Labour FM in three years – did not think so. A political streetfighter, McConnell like McLeish, had been a councillor and was perhaps more charismatic – some said “cocky” – than his predecessor. Certainly he was more robust and something of a political gambler – even an admittance of a previous extra-marital affair did not put a dent in his ambitions.Described as Scotland’s first truly Scottish First Minister – because he had not served in Westminster – he was determined to see devolution succeed but was keenly aware that the Parliament needed to settle. As a result, while he drove through the ban on smoking in public places, he was accused to doing little . His own personal ambition, it was said, did not become ambition for the Parliament.And of course it wasn’t all plain sailing. He was mocked for wearing a pin-striped kilt at New York’s Tartan Day celebrations, had to reverse a decision to attend a golf club dinner instead of D-Day commemorative events in Normandy, and for telling a group of high school pupils it was “OK to get drunk once in a while”.It took the joint forces of Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond to throw a spanner in the Labour rule of the Scottish Parliament. Andthere was a politician who was perhaps fated to become First Minister, it was Alex Salmond.A man who been iously described as one of the “most talented politicians of his generation” and a “populist with strategic skills”, he took McConnell’s cockiness and turned up the dial.Initially a gradualist towards independence, he happily threw his lot in with Dewar on devolution, but his initial relationship with Holyrood was rocky. Despite becoming an MSP he carried on as an MP too – spending most of his time at Westminster – and quit the Scottish Parliament in .However he made a dramatic comeback to the leadership of his party and stood for election to Holyrood once again in the ground-breaking  elections when he led the SNP to it’s first ever parliamentary election victory, with Sturgeon at his side.His first period as First Minister was one of competent managerialism, of governing on a “policy by policy basis”. But he did put down a marker by changing the name of the administration from the Scottish Executive to the Scottish Government, and then there was an often-forgotten white paper on an independence referendum produced in . It had to be withdrawn after failing to obtain support from other parties.His softly sofly approach to independence and the continuing collapse in Labour’s fortunes saw the SNP win an outright victory in the  Holyrood elections – something Dewar’s proportional represention was supposed to prevent ever happening – and gave him the  required to demand an independence referendum. Despite a hard-fought campaign on the “Yes” side, voters rejected independence by  per cent to  per cent in the  vote and, the following day, Salmond announced he was standing down as both First Minister and SNP leader.It left the way clear for his deputy Nicola Sturgeon to become the first female First Minister of Scotland. Her style of governing couldn’t be more dferent from that of Salmond’s bombast.A solicitor like Dewar, she may have gained an early reputation for being overly serious, but while Salmond remained at Westminster she became the party’s “Holyrood leader”, cutting her debating chamber skills on McConnell’s tough skin.After the  election, she became health secretary, seeing through popular SNP pledges such as the reversal \u2028of AE closures and the abolition of prescription charges. She also won praise for her handling of the \u2028swine flu crisis, and played \u2028a large part in the SNP’s \u2028historic majority in the  election.After her part in the independence referendum she was the obvious successor to Salmond and in her first six months in the job, she led the SNP to it’s biggest electoral success in a general election winning  of the  seats in Scotland. Then came a third successive victory in the Scottish Parliament election in , though again there was no outright majority.The EU referendum and her approach to Brexit has seen Sturgeon become a more UK figure than before – but she is a cautious politician, and while the desire for another indepedence referendum grows, she has thrown down the gauntlet to opposition parties to work with her on developing Scotland’s constitutional future.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

Everything was in place for her and it is really bad her le has been ended so quickly.”Conall was contacted after the vigil by Susan Curran, who came up with the idea of the walk.“The idea came about quite spontaneously the night after Lyra’s killing in a conversation I had with Conall,” she said.“Conall had organised the vigil but I was late in work that night and really gutted that I missed it. “The idea came in my head of a walk from Belfast to Derry. I just said to Conall let’s do it!“I was just overcome with anger about what happened and fear that we were going back to that.“We are just a group of people who want to react and take action. I have legs, a voice and a heart and that is all I need for the walk.“Everyone can take part in the walk in any way they can. We would ask people to challenge themselves. We are asking people to ‘Be more Lyra’.“Our message to people who don’t support us is for them to be honest with themselves and realise the majority of people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.“We don’t want any more young people in graves or swayed by violence. We want Lyra’s death to be the last Troubles-related death in our society.“Through the walk, we want to demonstrate the will of the majority of people in our society to reject violence as a means to resolving our issues.“We want to rejuvenate and bring new le into the principles of the Good Friday Agreement which has been broken time and time again. As ordinary people in society, we are fully behind it.“We have very real memories of the Troubles and we don’t want a repeat for our children and our children’s children.“We believe Lyra’s death will be a catalyst for change.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive.

Number one, they should not be doing this in a play park. They are treating it as a monument to a convicted terrorist and no matter what you think of how he died, that is completely and utterly wrong.\"This is a place where children are expected to go to play. It is not a place for apologists for terrorism to treat as a shrine.\"Secondly, after all that has gone on with the murder of Lyra McKee, society in Newry and right across the country should be shunning the organisers of this event.\"Saoradh do not and should not represent anything to do with this country. Society has given them the message. We should all show them the back of our hand and wed be a much better, happier society for it.\"Protests were held at the Saoradh offices in Derry by friends of Ms McKee after the murder of the -year-old. Red handprints placed on the front of the offices have since become an online symbol of protest by supporters of the murdered journalist.Since the murder, it emerged that the group, which has the support of the New IRA, has been issued with an eviction notice from its base at Junior McDaid House in the city.Social media accounts for the Derry-based faction of the dissident republican-linked group were also suspended, though accounts of the Dublin, Armagh and Belfast Saoradh offices remain online. When McCreesh was arrested in , a rle he had in his possession was found to have been used in the IRAs  Kingsmill attack, a sectarian massacre in which  Protestant workers were shot dead.However, Saoradh An Iuir spokesperson Stephen Murney said the group was \"immensely proud of the sac rice Raymond McCreesh made for his countrys freedom\" and hailed him a hero.Speaking ahead of the event, he said: \"This commemorative event will give everyone the opportunity to remember Raymond in a dignied and fitting fashion.\"No better place to have this event than in the heart of the community who hold him in such high esteem. Thats the reason we have once again decided to hold this event in Raymond McCreesh Park.\"Ray McCreesh was a revolutionary IRA volunteer and local hero. He made a massive sacrice and suffered for us all in an unimaginable way. For that we are eternally grateful and its a proud thing to have this park in Newry named in honour of his memory. The republican community in Newry have nothing but the utmost respect for Raymond, the sacrice he made and the cause for which he died.\"We will assemble at Ray McCreesh park on Saturday, May , at pm.\"Join with us to remember Volunteer Raymond McCreesh, st battalion, South Armagh Brigade, Irish Republican Army.\"McCreesh was one of  republican prisoners who died in the Maze in  and the naming of the park sparked a long-running controversy.Unionists demanded the name be changed, while republicans insisted it be retained with the SDLP caught in the middle.

The last process broke down in acrimony last February with claim and counter-claim on what had been agreed.Sinn Fein said DUP leader Arlene Foster had agreed a draft deal to re-enter devolved government that included concessions on the Irish language – a claim Mrs Foster denied.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Arlene Foster Many of the disputes are linked to a controversial voting mechanism that enables blocs of unionists and nationalists to veto measures which command overall majority support in the Assembly.A number of the smaller parties are calling for changes to the contentious petition of concern, believing its reform could unlock several logjams at the heart of Stormont’s impasse.With the UK Government reluctant to reintroduce direct rule from Westminster, Northern Ireland has operated in a political limbo for the last two years, with senior civil servants being left to run public services.Those civil servants are seriously hamstrung, unable to make key policy decisions in the absence of elected ministers.As a consequence, numerous governmental decisions are in abeyance with many major policy initiatives in cold storage."},{"url":null,"title":"baby news dup mla lockhart goes into labour at election count","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It dates back  million years, about  million years before the T. rex stomped the Earth.The newly discovered cousin — which was three times longer than it was tall — weighed between lb and lb, almost nothing compared with the nine-ton king of the dinosaurs.Introducing Suskityrannus hazelae, the long awaited tryannosauroid from the Moreno Hill Formation of New Mexico. Thanks to @VTechmeetsPaleo for leading such a great team for researchers. Great work everyone! https:t.co GWJVhQnG— Alan TurnerMay , Suskityrannus hazalae is not the first or even smallest of the Tyrannosaurus family tree, but Mr Nesbitt said it provides the best example of how this family of modest-sized dinosaurs evolved into the towering horror of movies, television shows and nightmares.Smithsonian Institution palaeobiologist Hans Sues, who was not part of the study, said it was an important find, adding: “Suskityrannus is the first really good record of the early tyrannosaurs in North America.”It is unclear why these carnivores, which were not particularly big compared with other dinosaurs alive at that time, later evolved to be so enormous.Mr Nesbitt said the newly discovered species is probably among the last of the little guys. It was bigger than earlier tyrannosauroids and had big feet needed for speed — something the T. rex lost."},{"url":null,"title":"spacex shipment reaches space station after weekend launch","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since.

He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy. The fact this has not happened is deeply disappointing, Cllr Curran continued.The local politician said the temporary one-way system is impacting on traffic volumes in St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street in particular, with some shoppers opting to avoid Downpatrick as work on the public realm scheme continues.Cllr Curran also suggested that the delay in delivering the public realm scheme would ldquosimply not be tolerated in any other area. He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

This senseless vandalism has to stop and stop now, he declared.ldquoThe play equipment was specically designed for small children and it is my understanding that the names of people who were spotted in the vicinity of the playground when it was vandalised have been handed over to the authorities.Mr Teggart said Crossgar was a village proud of its mixed community with people getting on well together and working in unison to make it a welcoming and vibrant place.ldquoWe all get along with each other but it would appear that there are several youths who are determined to cause harm and have no respect for anyone or indeed young childrenrsquos play equipment, he continued.Mr Teggart added: ldquoWestlands residents are rightly upset with one suggesting to me that whoever was responsible should be made to pay for the damage they have caused.Cllr Andrews said this ldquowanton act of vandalism was totally out of order and uncalled for, emphasising that it was children who suffered as a result of the ldquodespicable action of others.ldquoI have made local council officials aware of what happened and and hope that the damaged equipment can be replaced. I was proud to see a play park which had been neglected for years rejuvenated, but the damage to the equipment is so disappointing.Cllr Andrews said he had many good memories of growing up in Westlands, explaining that after years of having nothing, it was ldquowonderful to see the play park rejuvenated for so many to enjoy.He continued: ldquoI hope those responsible will be apprehended. The message must go out that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.Cllr Andrews said many people worked hard to persuade the local council to redevelop the Westlands play park and are bitterly disappointed that their commitment and dedication to the local community is not shared by others.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoshocked to learn that play equipment had been damaged describing those responsible as ldquothoughtless vandals.He continued: ldquoAll councillors worked hard to deliver this upgraded play park for the community and to see it so needlessly damaged in the first week it has been open is so disappointing and adds to the ongoing anti-social behaviour problem in Crossgar.Cllr Brown said he met with Mr Teggart at the play park to inspect the damage and discuss how the local authority and PSNI can stop such ldquoreckless behaviour in the future.He added: ldquoThis sort of action cannot continue and those responsible will be held accountable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Voters take to the polls  ","story":"VOTERS go to the polls across the district tomorrow to elect  councillors to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Seventy one candidates are contesting the seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob, Mournes, Crotlieve, Slieve Gullion and Newry areas.With the final day of canvassing already underway and candidates targeting any remaining undecided voters, all eyes will be on the magical turnout number which could decide success or failure for some.Turnout in the  council election was just over % which saw almost , people visiting polling stations across the district.As the local council prepares for its second four year term, Sinn Fein and the SDLP will be battling to become the largest party and it is certainly all to play for.Both parties currently have  councillors with Sinn Fein sources quietly confident that the party will have increased its number of seats once the final result has been declared.What is clear is that the final outcome of tomorrowrsquos election is the toughest to call in decades given the number of interesting battles taking place right across the district.Locally, all eyes will be on Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and The Mournes which are intriguing to say the least, with the outcome potentially resulting in a dramatic change in the political landscape and some high profile figures losing out.In Downpatrick, attention will centre on the battle between Sinn Fein and the SDLP for electoral supremacy in an area where five seats are available.The SDLPrsquos Dermot Curran, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor are out to retain their seats, with Sinn Fein aiming to ensure that Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden will secure seats on the local authority for the first time.However, Independent councillor Cadogan Enright firmly intends to retain his seat, with strong support from a number of leading community groups in Downpatrick and Lecale.Add Aontuacute , the Green Party , Alliance , the DUPand UUPinto the mix and the expected dog fight for the fth seat could well be decided by transfers.In Rowallane, Independent candidate Martyn Todd and Sinn Feinrsquos Marianne Cleary will try to upset the current status quo in an area where the five seats are shared between the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance.Sinn Fein has never held a seat in Rowallane before, but clinching one in a traditional unionist stronghold would represent a seismic sht.The SDLPrsquos Terry Andrews topped the Rowallane poll in , but was only  votes ahead of the UUPrsquos Robert Burgess, who is confident his running mate, Walter Lyons, who polled  first preference votes five years ago, can join him in the debating chamber.Lyons is the only Ballynahinch-based candidate contesting the poll, with DUP sources confident that Billy Walker and Harry Harvey will retain their seats. But with no TUV candidate, what will the  voters who backed Philip Hamilton in  do this time around Independent candidate Todd is expected to eat into sitting Alliance councillorrsquos Patrick Brownrsquos vote, with the Green Party intent on making an impression through Emma Cairns. Aontuacutersquos Liam Mulhern is contesting his first election and with  candidates chasing five seats the election count will be a particularly nervous affair.In Slieve Croob, the SDLP is keen to grab two of the five seats up for grabs with current encumbent Mark Murnin, the local councilrsquos current chairman, joined by party stalwart Hugh Gallagher.Sinn Fein has made its intention clear by fielding three candidates. Republicans currently hold two seats through Roacuteisiacuten Howell and John Rice and are aiming to ensure through the partyrsquos tried and trusted vote management system that Drumaness woman Cathy Mason will also secure a seat.Sitting DUP councillor Garth Craig is not seeking re-election with the party selecting Maynard Hanna to defend his seat, while Alan Lewis is flying the flag for the Ulster Unionists.Alliance currently hold a seat in Slieve Croob through Andy McMurray but he surprised many byopting to stand in the Mournes area, with his position being contested by university graduate Gregory Bain from Clough.The Mournes is another intriguing battleground where former South Down Ulster Unionist MLA Harold McKee is bidding to make ato local politics and the SDLP is aiming toits sitting councillors, Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn.However, Sinn Fein has an eye on one of the SDLP seats and is fielding three candidates, sitting councillors Willie Clarke and Sean Doran alongside Leanne McEvoy.Henry Reilly topped the poll in  while standing on a UKIP ticket.

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

The government has committed £ million to the Belfast city deal.The Londonderry package was announced ahead of today’s new round of Stormont talks aimed at restoring power-sharing in Northern Ireland.It comes weeks after the dissident republican murder of journalist Lyra McKee in the city. Many believe the extremists are exploiting disaffection and deprivation experienced by young people in parts of the city to bolster their ranks.Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said the Derry City and Strabane City Deal would boost innovation and the digital potential of the region and unlock local partner funding.She said it would enable new projects such as a Centre for Industrial Digitisation, Robotics and Automation and a programme of investment in the city’s digital connectivity infrastructure – subject to business case approval.“This £ million investment package is a major boost to the economic potential of the region and will help strengthen the foundations for greater prosperity and a stronger, more united society,” she said.“The new Inclusive Future Fund recognises the unique circumstances facing the region and will help create new opportunities for the whole of the community, especially for young people.“As secretary of state, I am deeply committed to building a dynamic, prosperous, outward-looking Northern Ireland that works for everyone, irrespective of community background.”The money offered through the Inclusive Future Fund will focus on delivering greater prosperity and social benefits by tackling issues such as deprivation and youth unemployment.Lyra McKee murder: Painting over of IRA graffiti sends ‘positive message’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful. In the law it doesnrsquot state what you have to use to pick up the dog fouling. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system. Everyone was kept safe by the traffic marshal Brian West.The Friends of Belle Vue Park held an Easter celebration of their own.They said: ldquoWe had a fantastic time with crafts, games, seed planting and selfies.ldquoThere were so many amazing Easter hat designs, it was hard to choose!ldquoThanks to all the hard-working volunteers who made the event possibleAs well as events held by churches and chapels, Easter egg hunts were a recurring theme for many venues.Cosmeston Lakes hosted their own hunt over the course of the weekend, inviting people to try their luck at solving clues for prizes.Llantwit Major Surf Lesaving Club held an Easter egg hunt on Easter Monday, with face painting, name the bunny, refreshments and hot drinks.St Fagans National Museum of History held their own ldquoBig Museum Easter Trail, asking visitors to solve clues and follow the trail around the museum infor an ldquoegg-citing prize. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".
