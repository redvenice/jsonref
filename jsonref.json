Culture Minister Helen Whately said she had \u0027met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction\u0027A public consultation on the issue was carried out between August and November 2019.Neil McArthur, the commission\u0027s chief executive, said: \u0027Credit card gambling can lead to significant financial harm. \u0027The ban that we have announced today should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have.\u0027Research shows that 22 per cent of online gamblers using credit cards are problem gamblers, with even more suffering some form of gambling harm.\u0027We also know that there are examples of consumers who have accumulated tens of thousands of pounds of debt through gambling because of credit card availability. \u0027There is also evidence that the fees charged by credit cards can exacerbate the situation because the consumer can try to chase losses to a greater extent.\u0027         Gambling Commission boss Neil McArthur (pictured in an announcement today) said the ban \u0027should minimise the risks of harm to consumers from gambling with money they do not have\u0027Mr McArthur said he understood some consumers used credit cards because of their convenience, but the risk of harm to others was too high to allow this to continue.He added: \u0027We realise that this change will inconvenience those consumers who use credit cards responsibly, but we are satisfied that reducing the risk of harm to other consumers means that action must be taken.\u0027But we will evaluate the ban and watch closely for any unintended circumstances for consumers. The ban is part of our ongoing work to reduce gambling harm. \u0027We also need to continue the work we have been doing with gambling operators and the finance industry to ensure consumers only gamble with money they can afford to spend.\u0027The Government has come under pressure to introduce bans for the use of credit cards for online bets over the past two years by charity groups including Gamble Aware and Citizens Advice.In 2018, the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board (RGSB) called on the Gambling Commission to consider restrictions on the use of \u0027borrowed money\u0027 for online gambling.Early in 2019, the watchdog launched a call for evidence on the matter \u0027to explore the consequences of restricting or prohibiting the use of credit cards in gambling\u0027.An estimated 24 million adults gamble in Great Britain, with 10.5 million of those placing bets online.It is thought that around 800,000 people use credit cards to gamble, with the regulator\u0027s own data showing that more than 165,000 customers made £46 million worth of credit card deposits in February last year.         The Gambling Commission made the announcement this morning, with its Twitter post aboveThe announcement is the latest blow to gambling businesses, after the Government introduced a crackdown on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which saw the maximum stake for bets cut from £100 to £2.Last year Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport ministers also met with banks and gambling operators to discuss their concerns.They also looked at how companies could use technology and customer data to help those at risk of developing gambling problems, including those using credit cards.Culture Minister Helen Whately said: \u0027Whilst millions gamble responsibly, I have also met people whose lives have been turned upside down by gambling addiction.\u0027There is clear evidence of harm from consumers betting with money they do not have, so it is absolutely right that we act decisively to protect them.\u0027In the past year we have introduced a wave of tougher measures, including cutting the maximum stake on fixed odds betting terminals, bringing in tighter age and identity checks for online gambling and expanding national specialist support through the NHS Long Term Plan. \u0027We have also secured a series of commitments from five leading gambling operators that will include £100 million funding towards treatment for problem gamblers.         Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from\u0027\u0027But there is more to do. We will be carrying out a review of the Gambling Act to ensure it is fit for the digital age and we will be launching a new nationwide addiction strategy in 2020. We will not hesitate to take any further action necessary to protect people from gambling harm.\u0027Adam Bradford, co-founder of the Safer Online Gambling Group, said: \u0027This is excellent news and it will provide an extra layer of support for people who are addicted to gambling.\u0027It has been a long time in coming and we are glad the Commission have acted decisively on this matter.\u0027The announcement comes amid a period of increased scrutiny on the gambling sector, which has seen criticism in recent weeks over its close relationship with professional sport.Last week, government ministers were told that the Football Association will not renew a controversial deal allowing gambling websites to screen live football matches.The sport\u0027s governing body faced pressure over its deal with Bet365 which allows people to watch live matches if they create accounts with the gambling firm.The Gambling Commission is also reportedly considering whether to clamp down on VIP schemes which can reward gamblers who habitually lose money with perks such as free bets, cashback on losing wagers or football tickets.         SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act\u0027Brigid Simmonds, chairwoman of the Betting and Gaming Council which represents the industry, said: \u0027The Betting and Gaming Council is a body firmly committed to raising standards, safer gambling and change.\u0027We will implement a ban on credit cards and indeed our members will go further to study and improve the early identification of those at risk.\u0027The use of credit cards were previously used as a potential marker of harm which might lead to further intervention with customers.\u0027Tracey Crouch, who resigned as sports minister in 2018, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Overwhelming debt accumulated via credit was a recurring theme by those addicts I met and heard from.\u0027This is definitely a positive safeguarding measure that will help many people at risk of harm from gambling.\u0027And SNP MP Ronnie Cowan, who has spoken out about the gambling industry, said: \u0027This is welcomed but we mustn\u0027t take our eyes off the prize and that\u0027s a completely new Gambling Act.\u0027Gambling firms saw their shares slide in reaction to the new legislation to ban the use of credit cards for online bets when the markets opened.Online specialist 888 saw shares slide 3.3 per cent, William Hill shares fell 3.2 per cent, Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings dropped 2.8 per cent and Paddy Power owner Flutter sank 1.4 per cent in early trading."},{"url":null,"title":"Royal commentators verdict Sandringham summit Queens statement Harry Meghan","story":"Share this articleImagine if Meghan is selflessly saving Harry from a mental breakdown, says VANESSA FELTZ | Vanessa Feltz | Columnists | Comment | Express.co.ukPrince Harry\u0027s regret as \u0027transition\u0027 crisis damages family relationshipsRussell Myers: \u0027Any doubt over which royal remains in charge has been laid to rest\u0027 - Russell Myers - Mirror OnlineAs Harry and Meghan are finding out, the royals don’t do ‘progressive’ | Simon Jenkins | Opinion | The GuardianRoyal Family will engage in a careful balancing act to avoid the nuclear option for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle | inewsHow did I get Meghan so wrong? | Coffee House"},{"url":null,"title":"Oprah Winfrey denies planning tell interview Harry Meghan","story":"Share this article A royal source said: \u0027Harry and Meghan\u0027s people have been reaching out to all the big US networks to explore the possibilities of a sit-down warts-and-all interview. \u0027Meghan feels she\u0027s been silenced and is no longer prepared to be muted.

The promised review was enough to persuade shareholders to commit more funds to cover ongoing losses.The review – along with another promised review of all regional transport connectivity – had featured in talks between ministers and Flybe, the Treasury said, adding: “In light of these discussions Flybe have confirmed they will continue to operate as normal, preserving flights to airports such as Southampton, Belfast and Birmingham.”Treasury sources denied reports it had agreed to allow the Exeter-based airline to defer an APD bill of more than £100m for three years.Air passenger duty, or APD, is a British tax on aviation, introduced in 1994. It is charged on each passenger on flights departing from the UK, and set according to the distance of their final destination and the class of travel.Destinations are grouped into two bands, above and below 2,000 miles from London, and charged at three rates – effectively for economy class, premium economy and businessfirst-class seats. All short-haul flights to Europe, including domestic, are charged in the same band, rising from £13 in economy to £78 in first class. A long-haul first-class flight now attracts APD of £528.Airlines have long lobbied against the tax, particularly after the rates were doubled in 2007.Flybe has argued that it is especially hard hit as the tax only applies to UK departures, and is therefore applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while an international return flight from the UK to Moscow pays £13 in APD.Long-haul flights from Northern Ireland are exempt from APD, as well as departures from remote parts of Scotland.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe chancellor, Sajid Javid, said: “I welcome Flybe’s confirmation that they will continue to operate as normal, safeguarding jobs in UK and ensuring flights continue to serve communities across the whole of the UK.“The reviews we are announcing today will help level up our economy. They will ensure that regional connections not only continue but flourish in the years to come – so that every nation and region can fulfil its potential.”Lucien Farrell, chairman of Connect Airways – the parent company of Flybe – said: “We are very encouraged with recent developments, especially the government’s recognition of the importance of Flybe to communities and businesses across the UK. As a result, the shareholder consortium has committed to keep Flybe flying with additional funding alongside government initiatives.”Flybe’s chief executive, Mark Anderson, said: “Flybe is made up of an incredible team of people, serving millions of loyal customers who rely on the vital regional connectivity that we provide. This is a positive outcome for the UK.”The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said his department would undertake “an urgent review into how we can level up the country by strengthening regional connectivity”. He said it would look at all the options to ensure airports could continue to play an important role in driving economic growth.The government had been urged by MPs, unions and business to save Flybe, which serves almost two in five domestic UK flights and employs more than 2,000 people. It carries 8.5 million passengers a year between 56 airports across the UK and mainland Europe, and is the main airline at regional airports including Belfast, Southampton and its Exeter base.The news came after a day when the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged that the government was “working very hard to do what we can” for Flybe and avert a further airline collapse so soon after Thomas Cook. The Conservatives had committed in their manifesto to improve regional connectivity.The pilots union, Balpa, welcomed the news. General secretary Brian Strutton said: “This is good news for 2,400 Flybe staff whose jobs are secured and regional communities who would have lost their air connectivity without Flybe.“The government is to be applauded for stepping up to the plate to help one of the few remaining independent UK airlines and a vital one at that.”The company’s pleas for help to survive the winter came less than a year after it was taken over by a consortium led by Virgin Atlantic, after posting recurring losses of around £20m per year.Flybe has long struggled financially, and the fall of sterling since the 2016 EU referendum has piled additional pressure on UK airlines, with major costs such as fuel incurred in US dollars.The airline has argued it is particularly hard-hit by APD, which is charged on each passenger on a flight taking off in the UK. While all short-haul economy flights, including domestic, are charged at the same rate – £13 – the tax is applied to each leg of a domestic return flight. That means, for example, that a return Flybe flight from Cardiff to Manchester is taxed at £26, while the duty on a Glasgow to Malaga return costs half that.While unions and the CBI had urged the government to help Flybe, any potential moves to ease APD were condemned by environmental groups. The MEP for South West England – a constituency that includes Flybe’s Exeter home – Molly Scott Cato of the Green party, said it was “absurd to suggest that we should provide a further boost to the aviation industry”. She highlighted that routes deemed socially necessary could be subsidised under EU rules – Flybe’s Newquay to London route is already funded with state aid.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “The government cannot claim to be a global leader on tackling the climate emergency one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel cheaper the next. Cutting the cost of domestic flights while allowing train fares to rise is the exact opposite of what we need if we’re to cut climate-wrecking emissions from transport.”Flybe flights were operating as normal on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d035e4d2f89036821165a964f60dc2372c69f14/0_0_2091_2105/master/2091.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=dc81cccbf4d2fd3da4b6756ef9e1febe 1760w","title":"my parkdale is gone how gentrification reached the one place that seemed immune","story":"Long an outlier in Toronto’s feverish property wars, Parkdale’s deep-seated problems were being turned around by its Tibetan community – but then the huge global real estate firms rolled inBy now, Michael Nguyen expects them: every month or so, someone representing one international real estate investment firm or another crosses the threshold of the Parkdale Intercultural Centre, a non-profit immigrant settlement agency he runs on a busy stretch of Toronto’s Queen Street West.“It’s the same every time: Who owns the building? How do I get in touch with them? Do they want to sell?” shrugged Nguyen, whose centre has been helping new immigrants adjust to Canadian life for decades. “We’re fortunate — the owner believes in what we do, so we feel safe. But you know the same questions are being asked of everyone all around here. And not everyone is going to say no.”Toronto’s much-vaunted international brand – the poster-child for extreme ersity, a global social experiment done right – has become a faded myth in many of its inner-city neighbourhoods. Property values have soared beyond the most fevered speculators’ imagination, mostly relegating those representing Toronto’s vast swaths of difference to the suburbs.Parkdale, however, an inner-city neighbourhood just six kilometres west of downtown along Lake Ontario’s shore, has long been an outlier. As Nguyen spoke, runny-nosed toddlers fiddled with coloured blocks, while their parents, all recent immigrants, tried to focus on an English as a second language class. Outside, Queen Street bustled with an almost fairy-tale version of multicultural Toronto: Tibetan monks in flowing orange robes slipping into a flow of South Asian, Caribbean and African immigrants a mom-and-pop grocer sells roasted barley, a favourite Tibetan snack other restaurants offer roti, a JamaicanIndian wrap that fuses the spicy flavours of both cultures.But the lively streetscape here masks a threat to what could very well be the last island of ersity in a city swamped by the flood waters of global capital. Huge international real estate investment firms have embedded themselves in Parkdale’s urban fabric, buying dozens of apartment towers and thousands of rental units. Residents claim that threats, intimidation, rampant eviction notices and strategic neglect have become common. So too have tenant protests and rent strikes, where slick corporate offices find themselves occupied by hundreds of angry tenants demanding redress.Those protesting, however, are the lucky ones. In a city famous as a landing pad for immigrants, many recently-arrived residents, often without either English or an understanding of Canadian legal protections around tenancy, simply pack up and leave.“Gone are the days of the mom-and-pop slumlord, which was the dominant make-up of the rental housing market in Parkdale for years,” says Cole Webber, a legal aid worker with the Parkdale Community Legal Services (PCLS), a provincially-funded agency for free legal services (which was itself evicted from its long-time Parkdale offices last year). “The fact of it is that the primary impediment for these corporations increasing their profits is the ongoing tenancy of working-class people who live in Parkdale. The only reason these companies bought these properties is so they can turn over the units. Period.”Parkdale has become one of those neighbourhoods, following a familiar script. Inner-city working-class suburb, the last bastion of affordable rent, becomes popular with artists and students, who lend it a certain zeitgeisty sheen property speculators follow rent and property value increase condos sprout like weeds neighbourhood becomes a whitewashed nowhere, like so many before it: Brooklyn’s Williamsburg, London’s Hackney, Berlin’s Kreuzberg, San Francisco’s Mission. Indeed, Akelius, the Swedish investment firm that now owns many thousands of apartment units throughout Europe, made that exact comparison about Parkdale in its most recent annual report.“There goes another community center,” quipped the Instagram account @parkdalelife about an infamous all-night McDonald’s being demolished to make way for a 700-plus unit luxury condo building, leeringly named “XO.” It was just the kind of hipster fatalism that infects neighbourhoods in the grips of late-stage gentrification. The McDonald’s, at Parkdale’s nexus of Dufferin and King Streets, had served as an informal refuge for Parkdale’s legions of homeless and mentally ill for decade. And by the time blasé youth in search of urban grit arrive just in time to become cheekily indignant about displacement, it’s already far too late.I lived in Parkdale’s orbit for almost 20 years, first in the late 1990s on its eastern boundary, and then its west a decade later. The neighbourhood’s infamous liquor store at Queen and Brock Streets was the only one I knew with a full-time police detail. Depending on the night, you could see a scuffle in the whiskey aisle, an arrest, or a fistfight or overdose in its parking lot often, there would be a solicitation for a low-priced trick from one of the prostitutes who routinely patrolled its perimeter. Once, I was witness to a tooth being knocked out, one homeless man to another, over an allegedly stolen beer. (In one of the few good news stories to come out of Parkdale recently, the city is trying to acquire the site of the store, now closed, to build affordable housing.)In a country like Canada, where we speak smugly of social safety nets and institutionalized humanity, here was a place that made it feel like that was all talk. In the late 1990s, Parkdale could be chilling: group homes housed hundreds battling mental health and addiction issues the less fortunate were left to the precarious realm of government rent subsidies and dilapidated, poorly-maintained rooming houses – or, just as often, the street. Along a deadened streetscape of mostly empty storefronts, drug deals happened in broad daylight, addicts raged and twitched, and Parkdale earned another name, Crackdale, day by day.It’s not hard to see Parkdale as doomed from the start. It was built in the late 19th century as a summer refuge for the city’s wealthy, with opulent brick mansions on a small bluff overlooking the water. Six kilometres from the smoky and bustling downtown, it was close enough for those with means to easily reach – and to keep those without away.In less than two decades, rapid industrialization clustering along the water’s edge changed all that. Apartment houses were built to accommodate workers, many of them immigrants, for the nearby factories and abattoirs hastily-sold grand Victorian homes were repurposed into multiple single-room dwellings.The decline of industry across North America in the 70s and 80s dealt Parkdale another blow, leaving the spartan workers’ housing to rot. The nearby lake – now toxic – and the six-lane expressway, built in the 1950s along the shore, ensured its squalor. Around the same time, the province of Ontario deregulated mental health care and shut down psychiatric hospitals, releasing psychiatric patients to seek refuge in privately-run care homes they found Parkdale’s chopped-up manses ready to receive them.Over the years, poverty and marginalization became deeply embedded. Social service agencies clustered in Parkdale to serve a disempowered population, and, by their sheer density, drew more into the neighbourhood’s orbit. Addiction made Parkdale a hotbed of a predatory illegal drug trade prostitution became rampant. Concrete slab apartment towers, built as slum-remediation in the “urban renewal” zeitgeist in the 50s and 60s, became vertical manifestations of the social ills they had been intended to erase. Drugs and crime settled into their concrete walls.Gentrification, on the surface, seemed less of a threat than an impossibility. As the rest of Toronto surged upward in the early 2000s, Parkdale was forever “up and coming” – real estate code for a litany of social ills – and a target for only the heartiest of speculators. Some did come, sprucing up half a block here, a cluster of houses there, but Toronto’s real estate boom left Parkdale’s intractable poverty largely intact.The people who did come were new immigrants and refugees, heading to the last inner-city refuge of low rent. The tower units were squalid but cheap. And slowly, the tide of crime and drugs began to recede. Thanks to a long-standing federal policy, Tibetan refugees fleeing persecution in China took particularly strong root through the 2000s and 2010s, opening restaurants and grocery stores along Queen Street.Immigrant groups had always filtered through Parkdale, finding their feet in a new country before moving on. But the Tibetans stayed, slowly transforming the broken and neglected district into a bright, vibrant family neighbourhood. Look at Google maps and you’ll see “Little Tibet” in the crook where Queen Street and Jameson meet. “Tibetans really broke the mould here,” Webber said. “They turned the neighbourhood into their social and cultural hub. They’re a stabilizing force, for sure.”Approximately 8,000 Tibetans call Canada home, and more than 6,000 live in Toronto, the bulk of them in Parkdale. That makes the neighbourhood the largest Tibetan community outside the country’s borders, though for how much longer is anyone’s guess. “All my family and friends who are in Parkdale, they tell me about people coming to Canada and not able to find a place in their budget in Parkdale anymore,” said Tenzin Tekan, one of Webber’s colleagues at PCLS, who came to Canada in 2006 with her family. “It’s not going to be Little Tibet much longer. We’re losing the community we built over years.”Parkdale’s burgeoning crisis isn’t unique. Working class neighbourhoods in cosmopolitan cities all over the world have been transformed into urbane playgrounds for the moneyed set. And global investors muscling into the rental housing market is no Toronto phenomenon. After the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US cratered the property market there, note Canadian professors Martine August and Allan Walks, huge swaths of rental housing were acquired by investment firms willing and able to wait out the market dip to recapitalize on the rent gap as the economy recovered.Last year, one of them, Blackstone, an international private equity firm that the UN recently accused of “wreaking havoc” on the global affordable housing market with “aggressive evictions” of low and middle income tenants, recently entered an acquisition deal with the Toronto-based firm Starlight Investments. In the fall, Starlight bought a $1.72bn (£1bn) portfolio of apartment towers one of the largest is in Parkdale.It’s a narrative of numbing sameness from which no city – no desirable city, at least – is immune. But things were supposed to be different here. As Manhattan became a mall for the global elite, and as San Francisco’s homeless population climbed into the thousands, Torontonians like me were smug civic boosters of our anomaly status. Here we were, a big city that worked, where different kinds of people could choose – and afford – to live shoulder to shoulder and be better for it.And for a moment, it was true. But capital moves quickly, and policy much less so. In less than two decades, housing prices in Toronto doubled, then trebled, then quadrupled: the average price of a single-family home went from $251,267 in January 2000 to $1,044,527 in late 2018. Toronto, a fabled city of immigrants, was fast becoming something else entirely. Whole immigrant communities who had gained a toehold in the city’s core were selling high and decamping for the suburbs, which is where the city’s vaunted ersity now lives.Real estate became a bloodsport, and Parkdale became convenient hyperbole for last-resort gentrification narratives. “We Bought a Crackhouse” read the headline of an infamous 2017 story in Toronto Life magazine, about a young family’s Parkdale renovation journey that included moving on the addicts splayed unconscious in the basement. The story tore open a gash in an urban skin already rubbed raw with rising inequity. The backlash was intense, vicious and unrelenting. It became an emblematic tale of the city’s escalating class war, pushed past the point of no return.“I used to say, in a kind of flip way, that I gave up on the inner city years ago,” says Deborah Cowen, a professor of geography who studies cities and social justice at the University of Toronto. Cowen lived in Parkdale in the 90s, when it was bottoming out. Even then, she says, you could see subtle pressures of gentrification building. “In terms of being homogenous, predictable, corporate and maybe even securitized — that certainly seems like the fate of Toronto, and without some kind of dramatic change, it will be.”How dramatic? Just last month, Cowen says, the city announced a $24bn affordable housing strategy with provincial and federal support. “I’m not convinced even that is enough to effect the change we need,” she says. Bureaucracies walk, while capital sprints: by the time anything gets built – eight to 10 years from now, or more – “what kind of city will be left to save?”Nerupa Somasale doesn’t need academic studies or government statistics to understand what she’s lost. Somasale, 23, bright and articulate with an engaging laugh in many ways epitomises Toronto’s global brand of harmonious multiculturalism. In the 1990s, her mother, from the Philippines, landed in Parkdale where she met Somasale’s father, a refugee from India.“Oh my God, I hate that. I hate it so much,” Somasale says, when I ask her about the city’s rosy reputation. “This whole idea of multiculturalism, ersity – it’s still used as something we should be proud of. But it suggests equity, like we all have a stake. It’s just not true. It’s the opposite. It’s branding for politicians and for tourists, nothing more.”Somasale, an undergraduate student in her final year of curatorial studies at Ryerson University, was born on the 19th floor of the building at 105 West Lodge Avenue in Parkdale – where recently the elevators stopped working, prompting raucous protest at the landlord’s offices over its alleged mass-eviction campaign. For better or worse, Parkdale has always been her home: through the 90s, when the crack trade was brisk and relentless through the 2000s, when adventurous urbanites were drawn further westward to a growing array of nightclubs and late-night restaurants and finally the last decade, where change was inflicted most visibly by a particularly aggressive corporate newcomer that saw the opportunity to craft a new identity for Parkdale entirely.It started in 2016, when an outpost of the Los Angeles vegan restaurant Doomie’s opened on Queen Street, swiftly followed by a non-dairy ice cream shop and a lifestyle boutique. Last year, 5700, which owned all these ventures, announced it was “rebranding” the neighbourhood “Vegandale,” with a slate of international food events under that banner.“Vegandale,” to many, was the same brutal invasion at street-level that was happening in the towers just a few blocks away. “It was a really tumultuous moment, like everything that had been happening here the past few years just burst out on to the street,” Somasale said. It shifted things for her. She became more engaged in activist efforts, more involved in the protest movement. “It was an erasure of history, and an intentional one,” she said. “They wanted to change a chunk of the neighbourhood in a way that didn’t benefit anybody that had lived here for years. It had that feeling: ‘There’s nothing here, so let’s just make it into whatever we want.’”There is, of course, a great deal here, which makes Parkdale’s quick transformation so alarming. But for Somasale, there’s little reason for hope. “Half the people I grew up with, whether they were my age or they were family members that were much older who had lived there for decades, have been displaced,” she says. “Because they can’t afford it – me included.”On a bright, early autumn day, Somasale asked that we meet in Kensington Market, a vibrant, ramshackle cluster of Victorian houses converted into cafes, fruit stands and vintage shops on the western fringe of Toronto’s downtown. Earlier this year, Somasale left her lifelong home, finally broken by non-functional elevators, floods and the enveloping chaos of the landlord-tenant war. In Kensington, she shares a one bedroom apartment with two friends – there is no escaping Toronto’s merciless rental rates.“I wanted so, so badly to stay in the neighbourhood. I looked for a year-and-a-half. It was like a horror story. For $600, I couldn’t believe what I saw. It was disgusting, terrifying. But they’d get away with it because someone would be desperate.”She sighs. “I have a weird relationship to this feeling of home, because I can’t even live there,” she says. “I visit every other week. But it changes so fast. It feels like neighbourhood amnesia.”What the data didn’t pick up was how the neighbourhood had changed on street level, and the three-year gap between then and now might as well be a lifetime. When Akelius, the Swedish real estate juggernaut with some $8bn in global assets settled its gaze on Toronto in 2011, Parkdale was a low-income immigrant neighbourhood. But it was no longer a bleak urban sinkhole. Thanks to the Tibetan community, and the hipster incursion that the Tibetans’ stabilising presence had drawn, it was an opportunity.In 2012, the firm started acquiring mid and high rise concrete slab apartment buildings in Toronto by 2016, it had amassed 37, and more than 3,000 apartment units. Many of them were along Jameson Avenue, which links Parkdale to the Gardiner Expressway, shuttling commuters to and from the city’s core.Akelius had already developed a successful business model in Sweden, Germany and the UK: identify neighbourhoods adjacent to fully gentrified districts – like Kreuzberg, a longstanding haven for Berlin’s Turkish population – and exploit the undercapitalization of its rental housing.Other landlords took Akelius as a model. MetCap Living, Parkdale’s biggest landlord with more than 20 apartment buildings, was accused of starving out tenants in 2017 on unheeded maintenance requests and issuing heavy rent increases in an effort to drive out low income tenants and attract new ones. Current rents on new units are said to often be double those paid by longtime tenants. MetCap president Brent Merrill, also speaking to the Star, said he had made every effort to manage maintenance requests, including a tenant hotline. Tenants pushed back with a rent strike at 12 buildings. The conflict peaked when a video emerged of Merrill narrowly missing a protester with his pickup truck. Merrill told the Toronto Star he was rescuing a terrified property manager from an angry mob.When the strike stretched out over two months, the company agreed to reduce its above-guideline rent increases to the provincially-mandated levels.As the rental market tightened, the presence of private equity firms grew. Timbercreek, with $10bn in assets across North America, Europe and Asia, bought several Parkdale buildings in the fall of 2018, including the two hulking towers on West Lodge Avenue where Somasale grew up . Tenants there had endured semi-functional heat and hot water for years, as well as leaks, floods and pest infestations. Elevators in the two 19-storey towers were often out of service for weeks. By the winter of 2019, tenants reported a rash of eviction notices. In March, dozens of hired a bus to take them to Timbercreek’s corporate head office in Toronto to serve their new landlord with hundreds of maintenance requests and a notice of their own. In a video of the event, one of the protestors made clear their chief concern: that the company was taking people to the landlord-tenant tribunal to evict them, and that, internally, Timbercreek had likened tenant removal to “putting a building through a car wash”. “This is the dirt you’re trying to wash away,” the protestor continued, gesturing to her protest sign-holding neighbours. “We are here to put you on notice: You have no idea the neighbourhood you are messing with.”Colleen Krempulec, Timbercreek’s executive director of marketing told the  that the company had evicted some tenants, usually for non-payment of rent, but the number was small: 17, in a property with more than 700 units. “And we’re not talking about a few weeks of arrears —we’re talking about months and months,” she said.In the months that followed Timbercreek’s acquistion, Krempulec said, the enormity of the maintenance challenge emerged. “These buildings were neglected for decades,” she said. “I would say West Lodge was in the worst state of repair we’ve ever seen.” Since taking ownership, Krempulec said the company had worked through more than 2,500 tenant maintenance requests, and had replaced all eight of the buildings’ elevators, as well as the heat and hot water systems.“The accusation that we’re deferring maintenance to encourage people to leave – nothing could be further from the truth,” she said. “It’s been a challenging project, there is no doubt – more challenging than we had originally bargained for. But we’re a long-term investor. We’re not coming in to flip the property. We have a long-term horizon.”In November 2019, Starlight – Blackstone’s Canadian partner firm – found itself on now-familiar ground: tenants, angry at rent hikes they claimed were well above the guideline rate, occupied its head office with a stack of unheeded maintenance demands. For Katrina Potts, who led the protest, the gap between tenant and landlord was stark. “The office was all waterfalls and glass and luxury,” she said. “We’re arguing with them over $100, $200, $300 a month, and they’ve just spent $1.72bn. You have to wonder if that’s a war we can win.”Parkdale, though, is not the kind of place where people give up. Tenant groups are organized and armed with legal aid, and new ideas incubate here among academics and activists. The pace of change, however, is something none seem able to solve. In 2010, Kuni Kamizaki, then a graduate student at the University of Toronto’s urban planning department doing a placement at a community agency and social hub for Parkdale’s low-income residents, developed an idea. He wanted to build a non-profit community land trust, in order to bank land and housing and rent it back to low-income residents at fixed rates below market value. Government had long-since abandoned building affordable housing itself, choosing instead to subsidize rent for qualified tenants in privately owned buildings. That meant public money was being used to pay off private mortgages, with nothing to show for it at the end. Wouldn’t that money be better spent paying for a permanent community asset? Kamizaki thought so, and the trust was born.In 2010, its goals seemed reasonable. Land values were rising, but Parkdale’s built-in buffers – the towers, a welter of social service agencies, dilapidated housing stock – made the pace seem manageable. There was time. When the trust finally secured seed funding and undertook a community-based planning initiative, it was 2015, and the landscape in Parkdale had shifted intensely. Akelius was ensconced others had followed and were applying its techniques with ruthless efficiency. And no fewer than a dozen new luxury condo developments were on the horizon.“Everything was just happening so, so fast,” Kamizaki said. “Big corporate investors were suddenly everywhere – how could we even start to grapple with that?”The land trust is still up and running, and can claim some small victories: a community garden 15 refreshed apartments it rents to vulnerable tenants at rates well below the market rate.Joshua Barndt, the trust’s development coordinator, is clear-eyed about what the trust can achieve in this climate, and what it cannot. In the face of multi-billion dollar acquisitions, “it’s not ‘how do we stop it’”, he said. “It’s ‘how do we capture some of the benefits of the changes for people who live here now?’ How are we intentionally a part of it? Instead of being pushed down the river, how do we ride along with it?’”Many others are struggling to simply leave the river behind. On a bright day far from Parkdale, Somasale is haunted by a past to which she can no longer connect. “For my family, Parkdale wasn’t a choice,” she says. “It was all we had. So it’s hard to move on.. I don’t feel like I can make it here in Toronto any more,” she says, musing about new horizons – Montreal, maybe, where rent is lower. “It’s sad,” she says. “Parkdale will always feel like home, but it doesn’t look like any home I ever knew anymore. My Parkdale is gone.”For Somasale and thousands of others, the loss is absolute – a place knit into your psyche, torn out and walled off, forever. For the rest of us, the loss is more abstract: of a city we were foolish enough to believe was different, or better, that was more than land values and profit margins – that, against all reason and odds, worked. A city we dared to love, and believe in, never more to be.Murray Whyte, the long-time art critic at the Toronto Star, is now the art critic at the Boston GlobeFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion or catch up on our best stories"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9c5db32d0127bbeecd71dd26ae41d43bff983dd/0_169_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=619ab6a74b882f21dfadf30b64efcde5","title":"driving city clean air zones birmingham","story":"Clean air zones, such as the one proposed in Birmingham, can work if we increase people’s options. Ministers must get involvedImagine a capital city where nobody has to die on the roads. It may sound almost impossible, but last year not a single pedestrian, cyclist or child lost their life on the streets of Norway’s capital, Oslo the only fatality recorded was a motorist crashing into a fence. (By comparison 12 people were killed in Bristol, a city slightly smaller than Oslo, in 2017 – and over half of them were pedestrians or cyclists.)The catch? The lives saved in Norway seem to have been a byproduct of a bigger plan to become a carbon-neutral city that would probably spark a mutiny if you tried it here. Oslo has closed some streets to traffic entirely, removed parking spaces across the city to deter drivers, introduced measures to stop parents doing the school run by car and reduced speed limits. There’s plentiful public transport and lots of bike lanes but the bottom line is, as Oslo’s mayor says, that while cities will always have traffic, “the drivers should act as guests”. And not very welcome guests, by the sound of it.Something like this would probably be the future for British cities, if we were serious about dealing with the air pollution filling urban children’s lungs, as well as tackling the climate crisis. This week, Birmingham announced proposals to stop people driving across the city centre, amid research suggesting that illegal levels of air pollution may be shortening the lives of children growing up in the city by up to half a year. Cars will be allowed into a new clean-air zone, but not through it to reach other parts of the city, forcing them out around the ring road, or otherwise encouraging drivers on to the bus.It’s following in the footsteps of other cities, including Bristol, which unveiled proposals last autumn to ban diesel cars from parts of the city in daytime, and Oxford, which this week published plans for a zero-emission zone in the centre with a £10 charge for non-compliant vehicles. Suddenly you can imagine a time when driving into a smog-laden city, in all but the greenest cars and for all but the most essential journeys, will feel as antisocial as smoking on the bus.But there’s bound to be a backlash, as there was in Oslo initially, and sometimes for reasons that aren’t so easy to dismiss. In Bristol there have been awkward questions about whether a ban would be fair on sick and frail people trying to reach hospitals inside the zone. Keeping polluting cars out of town, but letting drivers of new electric ones go where they like, meanwhile, hurts poorer families who can’t afford to replace their old car.It would be wholly unfair for ministers either to sit back and let local councils bear the brunt of motorists’ anger over all of this when they’re responding to national imperatives (Birmingham is one of five cities asked by central government to introduce clean air zones after a court ruling that Britain was breaching EU air pollution limits) or to expect this to work without serious improvements to public transport. We’re overdue an honest national conversation about how to do this fairly – and national politicians should summon the nerve to lead it from the front.Nobody drives in a city for the thrill of the open road, to put it mildly. There’s nothing fun about stewing in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and while sometimes drivers do it out of laziness, more often it’s just because it works because it would be lovely if everyone cycled Nordic-style to school with the kids, stopping en route for cinnamon rolls and neighbourly conversation, but sometimes life isn’t like that. Sometimes stuffing the children into the car is the only way to manage school and nursery runs in two different directions, plus getting to work on time, plus grabbing a supermarket shop on the way home – because too many Britons live frantic lives with no slack in the day and dismal public transport options.If you want people to drive less then you have to organise society in a way that makes that bearable, and that’s ultimately a job for central governments. It’s time national politicians stopped being backseat drivers here, and took the wheel."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f796da93264206701cb23ce7ed5d84982486fd83/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fd171590b87f3a7dced37fc041638dc","title":"trust politics public mistrust labour","story":"We’ve all heard it. I’ve heard it – on doorsteps, in the back of cabs and in cafes. “Politicians,” people will say, “you’re all the same.” Now, I balk at anyone who compares me to the blond baboon who is our current prime minister, but there is no doubt that trust in politics – and in politicians – is at an all-time low.People just don’t believe we’ll deliver what we say we will. They don’t believe we want to listen or to understand their lives. And they don’t believe we are able to do much to make their lives better. Lots of factors have contributed to this: the expenses scandal, the rise of fake news and, let’s be honest, too many politicians either telling lies (don’t get me started on the £350m for the NHS) or not giving a straight answer when they’re asked a straight question.A decade of Tory austerity has stripped away vital services and hollowed out high streets. Millions of people have simply lost faith in the ability of government to make their lives better. They’re angry about decisions made far away by people they don’t think have much of a clue about the stresses and strains of their daily lives.All of us in the Labour party should be concerned about the growing gap between voters and the politicians they elect to represent them. Not just because we’re democrats but because listening to people, being bothered about their lives and being rooted in their communities, is the only way we will win again. Our challenge is to restore both trust in Labour as a party of government and trust in democracy as the best means of delivering what the public wants. It’s a big task – but here are six things I would do to achieve this.First, we need to be honest, even if that’s uncomfortable. On social care we need to be clear that looking after the elderly will require people to contribute more in tax. When we’re asked whether immigration is too high, instead of fudging a response, let’s say what we think: no, it isn’t. The public isn’t stupid – people know when we’re trying to avoid saying something.Second, we need a new approach in order to reach decisions on long-term challenges. On climate breakdown, we need a plan that involves the public much more. Citizens’ assemblies are increasingly used around the world to build consensus. In Ireland, they helped pave the way for the historic changes on abortion, while in Poland they improved government response to major flooding. It’s time we used them here.Third, we need to recognise that people want more control over how decisions that affect their local communities are made. The UK is one of the most centralised countries in the world. While a step in the right direction, the “northern powerhouse” risks bypassing my region of the West Midlands and focusing solely on a handful of cities. Lisa Nandy is absolutely right that we need to devolve economic power away from Westminster and learn from what Labour councils around the country are doing.Fourth, we need people to feel their votes count. Under our first-past-the-post system, almost half of those who voted (14.5 million people) did so for a candidate who lost. Many who live in “safe” seats have given up on voting altogether. So, as well as long overdue Lords reform, we need to reform our electoral system so that parliament better reflects votes cast.Fifth, people should be automatically enrolled on the electoral register, as happens in countries such as Sweden and Finland. Inidual voter registration has meant millions of people are either not registered or are registered at the wrong address. If we reduce the minimum voting age to 16, as we should, then people could be auto-registered when they are issued with a national insurance card.Finally, if people are to trust our electoral process, we urgently need to combat fake news during campaigns. Apart from Twitter, which has banned political adverts, the social media giants aren’t stepping up. The result? A recent study found that nine in 10 of the Tories’ online ads during the election contained “misleading” information. We need a new public body to regulate online political ads, funded by a levy on the cost of purchasing the advertising space.These ideas might sound radical to some, but to me they’re just common sense. Unless we modernise the way we do politics, more and more people will give up on the idea that their participation is meaningful. Politics can change the world – but only if we change politics.• Jess Phillips is the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley and party leadership candidate"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34b482a0443d0f4c6c0fd90f4d668bd4d1748d1/0_136_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e162f997d63856d6c15c5a586912c3ec","title":"sacked silenced academics say they are blocked from exploring trans issues","story":"Universities are at a loss how to maintain free speech when both sides claim they feel unsafeOn the December morning that Jo Phoenix, professor of criminology at the Open University, was to give a lecture at Essex University on trans rights in prisons, Twitter roared into action, with several Essex staff and students tweeting allegations that a “transphobe” would be on campus.By 10am Phoenix was warned by a member of university staff that some students were threatening to shut down her lecture, as they said LGBT+ staff and students wouldn’t feel safe if Phoenix gave her talk. At midday the university decided to cancel it because disruption looked inevitable, and proper academic discussion unlikely.“I was furious,” Phoenix says. “It was very clear to me that those agitating were fundamentally anti-academic because they condemned me and my research without hearing what I had to say.”Phoenix, who is adamant she is not transphobic, had given the same talk at the University of Newfoundland in Canada a month earlier, to an audience that included trans scholars, without controversy. “They all liked it. So there is something unique about what is going on in the UK,” she says.The talk explored tensions around placing trans women in British prisons, and argued that there are problems with applying trans rights to criminal justice.Universities are negotiating a minefield, trying to maintain free speech while faced with two groups of people who both argue they are being made to feel unsafe.The vice-chancellor of Essex, Anthony Forster, has promised a review into what happened in December, and says the university expects its community not to interfere with “the rights of others to express views with which they might disagree profoundly”. He adds that Essex has “an equally clear commitment to being an inclusive community”.The transgender debate cuts across many academic disciplines, including law, education, gender studies, philosophy and history. So-called gender-critical feminists, who believe that gender is a social construct rather than innate, say they want to explore trans issues within their fields, but that they, and the debate as a whole, are being stifled in British universities.However, academics such as Tam Blaxter, a historical linguist at Cambridge University, who is a trans woman, say these arguments make trans staff and students feel vulnerable. “Universities are communities of staff and students first and foremost,” she says. “They will always have a function of discussing difficult issues, but making minority members feel safe and welcomed must come first.”Kathleen Stock, professor of philosophy at Sussex University and a gender-critical feminist, claims that last month Oxford University Press abandoned a book on female philosophers because her inclusion was deemed too controversial.Stock, who insists she is not transphobic, is one of the most prominent advocates of gender-critical feminism, and has faced calls for Sussex to sack her. She says that one reason the American office of OUP gave in December for dropping the latest book in a series called Philosophy at 3am, was that she was involved and would attract negative attention. “I think that is terrible and cowardly,” she says.  A spokeswoman for the OUP said it would not comment on the review process for inidual projects, but that it did not often publish collections of interviews and this was “a contributing factor to our decision not to pursue this project”. Dr Kath Murray, a research associate in criminology at Edinburgh University, says there are many obstacles to organising gender-critical events on women’s rights. An event was cancelled at Edinburgh in December because of fears the speakers would face abuse.Murray says one event that went ahead last year on sex-based rights required extensive security because of anticipated opposition. “There was a one-hour security briefing for speakers, seven security guards attending the event, a security sweep of the lecture theatre beforehand, and ID checks for all attendees,” she says.In December, another event was due to take place, on schools and gender ersity. Dr Shereen Benjamin, senior lecturer in primary education at Edinburgh and the event organiser, says it was intended to show teachers both sides of the debate. “I wanted to bring together gender-critical speakers who see the increase in referral rates of children to gender identity clinics as problematic, and believe it has multiple social causes, with speakers from trans rights organisations who believe it is due to young people discovering their true identities at a younger age,” she says.Benjamin says she was unable, however, to persuade any trans rights organisations to share the stage with gender-critical speakers, so the event was redesigned as a research seminar without teachers involved. However, when booking went live in December, the university’s staff pride network criticised it in an email to hundreds of staff, and on its blog, citing guest speakers “with a history of transphobia”.With at least one academic urging opponents to protest, Benjamin cancelled, fearing speakers would face abuse. “It is now so risky and frightening for people to talk critically about gender identity on campus,” she says.“We need universities to establish and maintain the boundaries of acceptable protest from within their communities, and to intervene quickly and decisively if there are any attempts at intimidation.”Jonathan MacBride, co-chair of Edinburgh’s staff pride network, says his committee felt the event “would be upsetting and hurtful for anyone who is trans or an ally to the trans community”.He says universities should not provide platforms for outspoken gender critics. “When someone has said publicly that they don’t believe trans women are women or, more harmfully, that trans women are men and should somehow be held accountable for the actions of a minority of predatory men in the world, that isn’t really a debate, it’s just hateful speech about an already marginalised minority.”Universities say privately that they are finding the debate difficult to navigate, because their obligations under the Equality Act seem to clash with freedom of speech. But Colin Riordan, vice-chancellor of Cardiff University, a member of the elite Russell Group, says: “This is a isive issue and rouses strong emotions, but if we don’t have the debate, how will we ever resolve it?”Riordan faced down heated demands in 2015 for Germaine Greer, the celebrity feminist, to be banned from lecturing at Cardiff on the grounds that she had made transphobic comments. He says: “The way universities have to approach this, like other difficult issues, is to defend academic freedom and uphold free speech, as long as it is within the law.” Sarah Honeychurch, a fellow at the University of Glasgow’s business school, says the problem extends beyond university management. She was sacked last summer as editor of the academic journal Hybrid Pedagogy, after signing a public letter by feminists questioning universities’ relationship with the LGBT+ charity Stonewall.“One of the founding members of the journal said on Twitter that my position was at odds with values he considered to be central to education,” she says.The journal managers blocked her from accessing any documents and have not spoken to her since, she says. “My background is philosophy. The idea that I can’t challenge anything is deeply troubling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

They embrace change in a way I would find very difficult,” he said, name-checking Billie Eilish and Greta Thunberg.After years of showing the women and men’s collections together, it was the first time since 2016 that Gucci showed a largely male-only show. Which goes against the trend for many fashion shows to be mixed but also illustrated the designer’s ongoing exploration of masculinity through his clothes.The press notes for the show, which were presented on lined school notepaper, featured a treatise against toxic masculinity and a plea for a kinder, more feminised maleness. “It’s time to celebrate … a baby man able to do bold and playful somersaults … who wonders in amazement when the world becomes new.”The show, called Rave Like You Are Five, marked the half decade anniversary of the appointment of Michele, who has had a huge influence on menswear, shifting the emphasis towards romantic flourishes and feminised, Maximilian glamour.Michele has helped Gucci have a bigger cultural impact beyond fashion, influencing pop culture through celebrities such as Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky. It has also become a lightning rod around issues of ersity and representation in fashion. Gucci was widely criticised for selling a blackface jumper and during a show in September a model staged a mental health protest on the catwalk after straightjackets were used in the collection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d8f8c3c9301d4813b2eec5bf44003addfd6e919/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b28f2aa4515473534f72b0a382ade88","title":"cats the goldfinch oscarbait movies academy 2020","story":"This year’s nominations have shown love for Joker and 1917 but a host of awards-primed films have been left out in the coldGiven a splashy premiere at the Telluride film festival, one of the most discerning of all the fall festivals, early word suggested that Motherless Brooklyn could return Edward Norton to the Academy’s good graces. But the three-time nominee’s long-gestating passion project (a starry adaptation of Jonathan Lethem’s award-winning noir) was ultimately more of a vanity project, complete with a mannered, almost parodic Norton central performance. It wasn’t a complete disaster but it felt like the kind of competent Miramax prestige pic that would have been pushed in 2003 and forgotten about by 2004.Clint Eastwood has developed an impressive habit of sneaking into the awards race at the last minute, dropping films late in the day, often speedily made yet always finely crafted. It’s a strategy that’s paid off on a number of occasions – Million Dollar Baby, American Sniper – but last year, the sterling credentials of awards-friendly fact-based drama Richard Jewell weren’t enough to make a mark. The film, which tells the story of the security guard falsely accused of planting a bomb at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, received solid reviews but also faced controversy over its inaccurate portrayal of a female journalist, alleging she swapped sex for tips. Audiences responded with apathy and the film gave Eastwood one of his worst-ever openings. As Jewell’s mother, Bates scored a supporting actress nomination at the Golden Globes and the Oscars but it’s a poor showing for a film that was aiming for so much more.When the fact-based legal drama Just Mercy premiered at last year’s Toronto film festival, complaints about its by-the-numbers storytelling were outweighed by both the film’s undeniable emotive power and praise for Jamie Foxx’s turn as a man wrongly accused of murder. He was seen as an instant lock for best supporting actor but as we edged closer to awards season, the film, and Foxx, started to lose steam. He picked up a Screen Actors Guild nomination but was shut out elsewhere and the film’s late release strategy meant that for many, it was unfairly buried underneath contenders with a more distinctive edge.Rushed by the director Tom Hooper in order to meet an Oscar-friendly release date, Cats was unleashed in such a shoddy state that a tweaked cut was shipped to cinemas just days after it went wide. Quite why Universal thought a plotless musical populated by nonsensically named CG monstrosities would appeal to voters is a mystery but the reception for the film was so bad that the studio removed it from its “for your consideration” roster soon after it tanked. Even Taylor Swift’s original, but forgettable, song couldn’t claw its way into this week’s list of nominees. The lessons should hopefully be clear: not every well-known IP should be resurrected, Tom Hooper can’t be trusted and, most importantly, don’t fuck with Cats.Like Just Mercy, Dark Waters took an aggravating real-life legal case and turned it into an involving, sturdy film – and like Just Mercy, it also failed to make a convincing enough argument for inclusion to Academy voters. A muted thriller about a staggering case of corporate negligence, it acted as more of a call to action than a fully formed movie, with the director Todd Haynes and stars Mark Ruffalo and Anne Hathaway mostly coasting. It’s the kind of story that viewers have become more accustomed to finding on Netflix and its underwhelming box office suggests that the small screen might be where similarly plotted stories belong in the future.Reuniting the stars of The Theory of Everything, Oscar-winning Eddie Redmayne and Oscar-nominated Felicity Jones, the ambitious period adventure The Aeronauts was sold on the strange assertion that audiences would care about seeing the pair together again. But while the Stephen Hawking biopic made an impact upon release, it’s not a film that’s stuck in the years since and Amazon’s ballooning semi-biopic was deflating for a number of reasons. A restrained release – the film was originally set to be on Imax yet ultimately in most territories reserved to streaming only – and polite, if unenthused, reviews meant that it couldn’t work as either a mass market effects extravaganza or an awards-friendly critical darling.On paper, so much suggested that a prestigious adaptation of The Goldfinch would be a natural fit for the Oscars, from the award-winning cast (Nicole Kidman, Jeffrey Wright, Sarah Paulson) to the Pulitzer prize-winning source material from Donna Tartt to a director whose last film, Brooklyn, was feted by the Academy. But when it came to the film itself, based on what’s been called unfilmable source material, Warner Bros granted it a token Toronto film festival premiere just days before it crash-landed into cinemas with one of the year’s worst openings and some of the season’s most hateful reviews.One of the many surprise snubs from this week’s Oscar nominations was the exclusion of the blaxploitation biopic Dolemite Is My Name. At this stage of the season, most hadn’t predicted it to figure in the best picture race but Eddie Murphy, who had been figuring heavily in the circuit, was seen as a strong contender for best actor. It’s a disappointment with a number of possible explanations: an unusually stacked category, some ill will toward Murphy for prior behaviour and also a refusal from some Academy members to take comedians seriously (Adam Sandler’s career-best turn in Uncut Gems was also left out in the cold)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a45b7d7664f209045873f0851ce860bd0664b5aa/0_91_6557_3934/master/6557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26d1e622800b6fa0e9b8db7a111172c6","title":"harvey weinstein trial jury selection","story":"Harvey Weinstein faced fierce opposition in a Manhattan court on Tuesday to his attempt to have the next critical stage of jury selection in his rape trial conducted behind closed doors.The New York district attorney leading the prosecution of Weinstein, Joan Illuzzi, was joined by several prominent news outlets in objecting to a defense demand that the jury pool be sequestered when they are subjected to inidual questioning by legal teams this week.Such a move would exclude all media and public from the proceedings, casting in secrecy the final steps taken to produce a jury for the eagerly awaited trial.Weinstein’s legal team made the demand last week, arguing that unless the potential jurors were questioned in private the film producer would not be assured of a fair and impartial trial.Defense lawyers have made numerous attempts to call for an adjournment on grounds that the jury pool is being tainted – from objecting to the sounds of women chanting an anti-rape anthem outside the courthouse to protesting about comments made by the judge in ordering Weinstein to stop using his cellphone in court.The second phase of jury selection, known as voir dire, is expected to start on Thursday and involves potential jurors being grilled by both defense and prosecution lawyers about their backgrounds and experience in the hope of flushing out any prejudices.Both legal teams can then remove up to three people from the jury pool without giving an explanation.Weinstein faces five counts relating to the allegations of two women that carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. They include two counts of predatory sexual assault, two counts of rape and one count of a criminal sex act.In her response to the court, Illuzzi objected to Weinstein’s attempt to have voir dire held in secret. “The procedure employed in this case is fair and reasonable. There is simply no authority for the proposition, advanced here by the defense, that exposure to pre-trial publicity requires inidualized, sequestered voir dire,” the prosecutor said.Lawyers representing the New York Times, the New Yorker, Daily News, Associated Press and other news outlets also filed a response objecting to Weinstein’s motion.They said that contrary to the idea that publicity would be harmful to the movie producer’s case, “Mr Weinstein and his counsel have sought to make their case through the media”.The news organizations point out that Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, has spoken to several publications and TV stations including Newsweek, ABC and CNN."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a32eec7507115be3c2864539cbd4fb8ba3f1140/0_266_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8165092224781b77e3a5fa3fd29f682","title":"how to make the perfect pie kitchen aide","story":"It all starts with great ingredients, then fill with care – and don’t overwork that doughWhat’s the secret to the perfect pie?Steffi, ChichesterThis sounds like a job for a proper, old-school butcher, Steffi. Not just any butcher, either, but Jon Thorner’s in Somerset, the nation’s reigning pie champion. And it turns out there’s no secret at all, says general manager Dan Snook: “Just lots of care and attention, plus quality ingredients of good provenance.” So a bit like just about any culinary endeavour, then.But there are a few basics that anyone in pursuit of pie perfection should maybe bear in mind. First off, the pastry: whether you opt for puff, shortcrust or pâte sucrée, don’t overwork the dough, or it will be dry and tough and only add enough water just to bring it together, or it won’t bake through properly and will end up unpleasantly rubbery and chewy.Thorner’s pies are all made from scratch by hand, and they all feature a shortcrust pastry that just happens to be vegan by default, rather than by design. This came in very handy indeed last year, when their curried butternut squash and sweet potato pie took the top prize at the annual British Pie Awards in Melton Mowbray. The gong turned Thorner’s vegan pie from something of a niche product at their Shepton Mallett shop, where they shift about 3,000 pies a week, into a much more mainstream one, though Snook doubts it’ll ever rival their bestseller. “That will always be the steak and ale,” he says. “With pies, people are traditionalists.” Still, a much-hyped vegan product never did Greggs any harm, did it?What you put in your pie obviously depends on what you fancy at the time, while the filling to pastry ratio depends mainly on how many it’s feeding. “With our small, inidual pies, that works out at roughly 50:50,” Snook says, “but with larger ones it’s more like 65:35.” And never, ever cheat on the filling, he warns: “Few things are more disappointing than cutting into a lovely-looking, golden pie only to find it’s half empty. That’s why we fill ours almost to the brim.” But only almost, or that delicious filling you’ve spent time and money on will very likely bubble up during the baking and turn the lid soggy, or burst through entirely, leaving your pie looking like an unholy mess and the inside of your oven even worse.Whenever possible, make the filling ahead of time, advises the UK’s unofficial pie king, Calum Franklin, executive head chef of Holborn Dining Room in London and purveyor of some of the most staggeringly intricate and beautiful pie-based creations known to humanity. “Not only because the filling needs to be cool before going into its pastry parcel,” he says, “but it also gives you the luxury of time to build a spectacular pie without the pressure of having to do everything at the last moment and your guests starting a riot because it’s midnight and they still haven’t eaten.” And if the filling features gravy or sauce of any kind, “make sure it’s thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, or it will be very hard to cook the pastry well – watery sauces just soak into the dough.”As for the baking vessel, Franklin prefers a spring-form cake tin to more traditional pie-ware: “It’s a cracking mould to build a pie in, because it’s so easy to remove the finished article from, and it guarantees you a gorgeous, high-sided, deep-filled pie.”Franklin doesn’t have much truck with obsessives who argue that, to qualify as a pie, the filling has to be fully encased in pastry, and who dismiss anything else as just a stew with a lid. “It would be more accurate to call that a ‘pot pie’, but while I personally prefer the spectacle of a free-standing, fully wrapped pie – historically, it’s more accurate to say that that’s what constitutes an actual pie, anyway – it’s not something to get stressed about. It’s your dinner, so you can call it whatever you like.”• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

We all know the world is melting and we need to do everything we can to help the environment. I already walk everywhere, try to grow my own vegetables, eat seasonally, shop local, try to have zero food waste, have a worm farm, compost, host a beehive, bring my own bag and refuse to use takeaway cups, but for some reason I never switched to a plant-based diet. I know that it is the easiest thing you can do to stop putting stress on the world from an agricultural and an ethical standpoint – with an obvious side effect of overall carbon emission reduction.But it is hard. For me, it is hard because I write about food for a living. I write about restaurants and bars and aside from the obvious need to eat butter, cheese, meat and other non-plant-based things while reviewing, alcohol isn’t plant-based either. You know the reason why your Campari is red? Beetle shells. That wine you’re drinking? It’s been fined and filtered with eggshells and fish products. And though some people might, a food critic cannot subsist on vodka and unfined, unfiltered wine alone.But that’s no excuse. There are 21 meals in one week and for me only three are reviews. I also know the contents of my fridge (butter, eggs, stock, yoghurt, congee) and I need to be realistic about how drastically I can change my diet. So three months ago I decided that for three days a week – nine meals – I would eat vegan.I thought that just because I don’t drink milk or eat meat at every meal, I was pretty good already. I was wrong. I am that asshole who does all her meal prep at the weekend so I have at least five days of breakfasts, lunches and bases in the fridge. I had no idea how heavily I relied on eggs for breakfast, how much butter I consumed and how much I relied on stock-based meals until I stopped cooking them.Since the environment was my primary motivation for adopting a partial vegan diet, I set myself some rules.Thankfully meal-prepping legume-based dishes like soups, curries and salads takes no time, and any excuse to incorporate more colour and variety of vegetables into my diet is a good thing.I found myself getting out of my go-to prep or clean-out-the-fridge dishes and making foods I never would have otherwise attempted at home, like dosa (for you sandwich press chefs out there, the batter also cooks very well in a toastie machine and doesn’t stink out the office) and finding more creative ways to eat whole grains, tofu and legumes.Surprisingly, as I cut animal products out of my diet, I found that I wanted them less and less. My three days of plant-based eating slowly became four, then five, and then I found myself eating like a “regular” person only when I went out with friends or for work.From an athletic perspective, despite training intensely six days a week, my energy levels and strength did not change. As for my weekly food spend, my grocery bill was halved although if I bought packaged, processed foodsthat wouldn’t be the case.As for the negatives, there are only a few and they barely qualify as negatives. One is a personal preference: I am not a fan of tempeh. No matter how you marinate it, fry it or deep fry it, we will never be friends.The second negative is that nothing will prepare you for the wind. I’m talking about your own, your partner’s and the fact that you will be holding in a lot of gas so you aren’t ostracised from society. After a week or two of adjusting, your body gets used to all the starches fermenting in your guts, but you need to hang in there and cross that threshold.And finally, even though you haven’t told them you’ve switched to eating a mostly plant-based diet, people will have very long-winded opinions about it, and they will feel it is imperative that you listen.

Green has always denied any unlawful behaviour towards employees.In the wake of last year’s storm over the allegations, Brady initially said she had a “sense of duty” towards employees of Green’s holding company and that “walking away” would have been the easy thing to do.However, a fortnight later she resigned from Green’s Taveta Investments, which ultimately owns Topshop and Miss Selfridge, in February 2019.On Tuesday, when asked on Sky News’s business show Ian King Live how she squared her “feminist credentials with some of the things Sir Philip was accused of”, Brady replied: “Well, I didn’t square them because I resigned. I think that says all it needs to say.”Brady, a Tory peer in the House of Lords, is best known for the leading roles she has played at the Premier League football club West Ham United, where she is vice-chair, and as an aide to Lord Sugar on BBC One’s The Apprentice.The businesswoman first came to prominence in 1993 at the age of 23, when she was appointed as managing director of another football club, Birmingham City, and is still frequently referred to as “the first lady of football”.That prolific and high-profile business career has enabled Brady to become a champion of women in the workplace.However, at the same time as campaigning for women’s rights, she has also been closely associated with some of business’s most unreconstructed figures – including Sugar, Green, and the former pornographer David Sullivan, who owned Birmingham City before acquiring half of West Ham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2056f4bea8afb4f42e511902ee23dedca299d7dd/0_0_4581_2749/master/4581.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d671debcbca6434098ee7b0850087d6","title":"quique setien barcelona job cows new manager","story":"There are 3,537 people in Liencres, 9km west of Santander, or there were. Today, there is one fewer. There are also a lot of cows. “Yesterday, I was walking past cows in my home town today I was at Barcelona’s training ground coaching the best players in the world, an enormous club,” Quique Setién said at his unveiling as the new manager at the Camp Nou in place of Ernesto Valverde. “I’m an emotional man, and this is a special day,” he added, and it showed. There was humility, gratitude and at times even the sense that he was overwhelmed, still trying to digest the fact that this had actually happened.It is some leap: not just from Liencres, but from Lugo, Logroñés and Las Palmas, Poli Ejido and Real Betis, the clubs where he has been before. Setién once joked that his one-match trial in charge of Equatorial Guinea, after which they did not call him back, was at least “something to go on the CV” now that CV includes the biggest club of all. “This is the absolute pinnacle you will never go higher than this, and I have to make the players feel the same way,” he said. “Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined being here.”Setién knew there were members of the club’s board who liked him, and few men have so publicly embraced Barcelona’s identity, as expressed by Johan Cruyff, quite like him – certainly not from the outside. Yet when the call came, he was shocked, not least because of the team he inherits. He was swift to thank Valverde, a man of “principles” whose work he was “grateful” for. “He leaves me a team that is top. When you’re there, out of work, waiting for an opportunity, you imagine a team that’s down the bottom, in trouble. It’s not normal to take over a team that’s first,” Setién said.The call that had come the previous day was a little embarrassing for the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, who had tried to suggest that this was not an improvised solution sought when Xavi and Ronald Koeman turned Barcelona down. Bartomeu also admitted that he would have liked to have “done things differently” when it came to the manner in which they sacked Valverde.Otherwise, Setién said all the right things, including the message that youth team players could expect opportunities if they earn them, the declaration that he comes with “enormous energy”, the enthusiasm in every word, and his desire to add the “intensity” and “work” to ensure that games such as the 3-2 loss in the Spanish Super Cup which precipitated Valverde’s departure “do not escape us”. Above all, the recurring theme was his commitment to a philosophy that is supposed to define Barcelona, one which he said would be “clear”.These were not platitudes these were the truth – Setién has said them before, when he did not have to, not just now when he did. He once said he would have cut off his little finger to have played for Cruyff, Barcelona’s great ideologue and he once claimed he would “not stop crying” the day Messi retired. At least he can now say that he has worked with him. “I’m still not fully conscious of the fact that I’m coaching the best player in the world and his team-mates,” Setién said.“What I always say in these situations is that I will only guarantee one thing: that my team will play well. Las Palmas, Lugo, Betis … if you followed them you know we had an identity, you saw it, we played good football. The thing is, this is Barcelona and they always play well anyway. We’re clear on that. I have convictions: once an idea’s in my head, it’s very hard to get it out. I defend my ideas. If I have to die with them, I’ll die.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/342b9318ccca0f55b040f6c81b6dc367fb55eddf/0_150_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c46c3a067546d76222a313957ef14e7","title":"tottenham hotspur v middlesbrough fa cup third round replay live","story":"In the event of a draw tonight: There will be extra time and then penalties if required.

Despite recent complaints that he doesn’t have a centre-forward to fill in for Kane, the Portuguese manager elected not to include Irish teenager Troy Parrott in his squad for Saturday night’s defeat at the hands of Liverpool. It will be interesting to see if the highly regarded 17-year-old centre-forward gets a run-out tonight.Middlesbrough boss Jonathan Woodgate has had to plan for this game without the services of Ryan Shotton, George Friend, Britt Assombalonga, Daniel Ayala and Anfernee DIjksteel, who are all keeping Boro’s medical staff busy.

When I was 45 my husband left me quite suddenly after 25 years of what I thought was a very happy life. I was miserable but I could cope. After six days I met my current husband and apart from being unhappy I was also in love. But then I turned 47 and two or three months later I felt so miserable. Just out of nowhere I felt really really sad. I had no money, I missed my children, and my work wasn’t going well. It feels like I had to cross some sort of swamp to get to the other side. Now, at the age of 54, I am happy and have been for quite a while. Manon Sikkel, 54, writer, AmsterdamIt’s weird timing that I’m seeing your article now, at the age 47, as I do feel like I’m questioning a lot about life these days. I think a lot about the difference between how I thought life would be and the reality. I became a parent quite late and, to be honest, I do struggle with the practicalities of looking after a pre-schooler. I do love my little girl, but it can often feel like hard work at a time of life when used to think I’d feel less pressured and stressed.Work-wise, I became self-employed two years ago. Partly because of childcare issues, but also because, working in marketing, I could sense myself losing touch with the latest developments – especially on the social media side. Obviously family time is important and we all need to earn a living, but I suppose this is an age where I think I haven’t achieved what I might have wanted (although I was never totally sure what this was). Or I at least wonder what else I could be doing that might be more fulfilling. It is a funny time of life for me, and I don’t want to moan as I do appreciate there’s not actually anything wrong with my life. Hopefully things will change as my daughter becomes more self-reliant and I can enjoy time with her more. And while I must admit to feeling quite lost now, I think my 50s could be OK. Matt, BirminghamSorry to go against the findings but I would say that my 40s in general were probably the best period of my life. My life changed a lot during my 20s and 30s and I had a lot of fun as a performing musician, but having young kids and being very involved with their development was very satisfying. The relationship with my partner was good and I reached a kind of maturity whilst still retaining most of my energy and enthusiasm for life. I would definitely say I was far more satisfied with life at 47 than I was at 57. Andrew Jarman, 63, works in event production, Seville, SpainI worry a lot: about money, my kids’ happiness, my marriage, and family issues. I miss my dad who passed away I have insomnia and I’m not sure where my life is going. I feel so tired that at the end of the day I go to bed before the kids! So I don’t really do anything for me, not anything that I can sustain, anyway, because I’m either with the children, at work or too tireddon’t have enough money. I am unhappy about my home: my husband is a bit of a hoarder and we have a very small house. I hate the clutter as it stresses me out and makes me sad, but he won’t throw anything away. It upsets me. Katie, 47, SydneyI’ll be 47 in a couple of weeks. Physically I’m in good shape and quite active. However, over the past nine months or so my mental health has been very poor. I’ve had quite severe depression and anxiety attacks. I’ve tried therapy (not very helpful) and am on antidepressants, but feel like I’m really only just keeping my head above water. I haven’t been off work but cannot focus and feel like I’m just going through the motions when I’m there. I don’t socialise as much as I used to, and don’t tend to enjoy it when I do. There are a number of factors that have combined to hit me hard at this age.I have a job with lots of responsibilities and stress a parent with dementia and poor health and the various stresses and strains that go with being a husband and parent. I’m lucky enough not to have financial worries, but even so I find managing my personal finances stressful. Most of all, though, it’s that classic midlife realisation that I’ve spent more than 20 years in a career that I don’t really enjoy or find meaningful or fulfilling, and that the clock is ticking if I want to spend the rest of my life doing things that I love and are important to me. John, LondonAt the time I felt there must be more – that the monotony of existence couldn’t go on. Then, a few weeks before my 47 birthday, my husband announced he was having an affair with his secretary. He packed his things and left. I was pretty cross about him throwing away a 25-year relationship in such a cliched fashion – but a part of me was singing with joy. This was my ‘out’. The following year wasn’t a pleasant one, and I did grieve for what I lost – but I love my new life. I have a home, children, friends, a resurrected career and no miserable old git asking how much my boots cost. I have become much happier. Naomi, OxfordshireGhastly. I was working 12 hours a day to support my family, with a house husband who hated staying at home to look after our two children but couldn’t find a well-paid job. This put a terrible strain on our marriage. I discovered later that he spent his day online in sex chat rooms. I felt unattractive, exhausted from my three-hour commute every day into London, and a bad mother. Not surprisingly, at 49 things came to a head. I ended up having an affair and we orced when I was 51.I put on weight through excessive drinking and a lack of exercise. I saw the first symptoms of menopause and had difficulty sleeping. In bed at night I had the sensation of ants crawling over my legs. There were some very dark times when I had massive rows with my husband and walked out of the house, only returning after five or six hours. I have now been in a loving and secure relationship for nine years. Gemma, DorsetI’m generally happier than I’ve ever been. No one told me middle age was so enjoyable. I know who I am and still have enough energy to enjoy life. I have sod all to prove to anyone at this age so I can enjoy my dreadfully dreary and mundane hobbies and activities without fear of what people might think. It’s great. Only down side is my job which is down to a lack of skilled positions in my area - but the pay is ok and it keeps me out of trouble. David, CarlisleAt the age of 46.5 I feel quite drained by the daily routine which involves managing a household, two kids and a full-time job. I have come to realise that over the last year or so, every holiday I take is followed by an utmost struggle to fit back into the usual pattern and this has induced me to reflect on the quality of life I live and my expectations. I am obviously a little unsatisfied with how I live even though I have a safe job, I am not overworked, and I have two lovely kids who are great fun and who have happy lives. I feel like life is slipping by and I am not really embracing it wholeheartedly as I am overwhelmed by daily chores. I basically wake up longing for the moment when at the end of the day will go back to bed!

This is the most substantial investigation I think there has been of the case and I think will raise real questions about it.”The Lubbock documentary, Unexplained, has been made with the cooperation of his family and broadcasts for the first time the 999 call made after his death in Barrymore’s swimming pool in Essex.Katz said: “It’s extraordinary that 19 years after Stuart Lubbock was found everyone knows that something terrible happened there and no one’s been held accountable … I think this show moves some way towards answering that gap.”Terry Lubbock, Stuart’s father, said: “The story has become so distorted and confused over the years. So much has been said and written. It’s time to put all the facts together in one place.”Also this year Channel 4 will follow up its 100 Vaginas series with a “provocative look at 21st-century masculinity” in a candidly titled programme called Penises, and it will examine women’s changing attitudes to pubic hair in Bring Back the Bush.Other provocative shows include the Segregation Experiment – a programme that follows a school’s tests for unconscious bias in children in ways that include segregating them, and a satirical look at Prince Harry and Meghan’s plan to step down as senior royals in the return of the comedy The Windsors.Additional highlights include Write Offs – a series about illiteracy hosted by Sandi Toksvig culminating in a spelling bee – Channel 4’s move into natural history with Living Wild and comedies including Amy Poehler’s co-creation Duncanville and the comedy series Maxxx on new youth channel E4.Channel 4’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, said it was important to focus on attracting more younger viewers because “their behaviours are changing faster than older viewers, they go more to streaming”, but said “we still want to be broad” and appeal to older audiences.Katz said the broadcaster’s new regional bases were helping to change its makeup, with some ideas not being commissioned because the new regional commissioners were telling him that “no one outside London is interested in that”. He said the less metropolitan feel would become more apparent when the BBC Breakfast presenter Steph McGovern begins her new daily current affairs show in the spring.The Channel 4 bosses appeared confident that the broadcaster can continue to challenge convention despite clashing with the government last year over its decision to fill Boris Johnson’s empty place in its climate change debate with an ice sculpture and after Johnson was called a “known liar” by Channel 4’s head of news and current affairs, Dorothy Byrne.Mahon noted that the government’s threat to its remit made during the general election had been withdrawn and said: “Elections are a heated time. On the climate change debate, Ofcom gave us a very clean bill of health on impartiality.”Meanwhile, Katz said after the success of Brexit: The Uncivil War, which starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings, “we are working on a number of projects with James Graham who wrote that show”, but whether Cummings will be in them or not “is another question”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6c5ced8a0b2b5fdc002ce37ff44470f7127c9b9/0_557_8360_5016/master/8360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5713ed9ddea5cb90ac32e2955a4743","title":"netflix accused of funnelling uk profits through netherlands","story":"TV streaming giant pushed up to £330m in profits through low-tax state despite generous UK reliefs and rebatesNetflix has been accused of funnelling as much as £330m in profits made from operations outside the US into tax havens, while receiving generous relief for making shows such as The Crown in the UK, which helped cut its bill.The Taxwatch thinktank has estimated that in 2018 Netflix moved between $327m and $430m (£250m-£330m) in profits from international operations outside the US, including the UK, to low-tax jurisdictions such as the Netherlands.Despite having more than 10 million subscribers paying more than £860m in subscription fees each year in the UK, Netflix UK received a €57,000 (£51,000) rebate from the government in 2018. The company’s UK financial filing stated revenues of just €48m, and pre-tax profits of €2.3m, because the hundreds of millions of pounds from British subscribers are channelled via its European headquarters in the Netherlands.At the same time Netflix, which has a market value of $150bn, claimed £924,000 in tax relief as part of government incentives to make sure Britain remains a competitive location for making productions, according to the report. High-quality TV shows made in the UK that cost more than £1m per episode to make, such as The Crown, and films that pass a “cultural test” are eligible for relief. Netflix, which has more than 200 staff in the UK, spent $500m making more than 50 TV shows and films in the UK last year.“This research shows that Netflix is ripping off our public services by channelling profits through tax havens even though it appears to have employees, property, and a substantial customer base in the UK,” said John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor.“What’s even worse is that Netflix is claiming tax reliefs in the UK at the same time as it’s channelling profits overseas.”McDonnell said the report shows the government needs to go further than implementing its proposed “digital services tax”, which the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts will make just £30m each from the likes of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Netflix.“The government should ... support Labour’s proposal for unitary taxation of multinationals, which would require Netflix and other large multinationals to pay their fair share of tax,” he said.A Netflix spokesman said: “Netflix has always paid the taxes required in the countries where we operate.”Amazon, which is being pursued by the European commission for more than €250m over “illegal tax advantages” in Luxembourg, paid just €55m in tax on European revenues of €24.9bn in 2017. In 2016, it paid €16.5m on revenues of €21.6bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38da4504b59fedbaf94c227ea9a5f583c7743390/0_149_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7a51521ac2603973b6bc6b5b03e203e","title":"wang capucon chopin franck barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonWang’s crisp and agile piano highlights Capuçon’s warm and intense cello as the star pair perform the concert of their CDA pair of stars don’t necessarily make for a great musical duo, but something seems to have clicked for cellist Gautier Capuçon and pianist Yuja Wang. This arch-romantic programme of Chopin and Franck found them on electric form, single-minded in their approach to music even while it highlighted their different strengths.The warmth and intensity of Capuçon’s cello was thrown into relief by both the crisp agility of Wang’s piano playing and her sometimes surprising switches into understated quietness. Franck’s Sonata in A Major had a singing quality that carried it from its lilting beginnings to the soaring finale. Arranged for cello with the composer’s blessing, it was originally written for the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe, who gave the premiere at his own wedding – something to think about next time the speeches go on too long – and it wasn’t a stretch to hear joyous church bells in the finale’s pealing scales.Chopin’s Introduction et Polonaise Brillante initially found Wang taking an accompanying role, but ended with a dazzling display from her – of course Chopin couldn’t keep the piano in the background for long. Nothing seemed to faze Wang, either here or in Chopin’s later Cello Sonata, where only a tendency to lose melodic clarity at the moments of greatest frenzy betrayed any sense of difficulty. Capuçon shaped long phrases as if he were a singer whose breath never needed topping up. The high point came with the slow movement, standing out from the dark drama around it in its almost innocent simplicity.If the performance seemed well-oiled and absolutely secure, that wasn’t surprising: Wang and Capuçon toured and recorded this programme, and released the disc last month. This, then, was the concert of the CD – right down to the encore, Piazzolla’s Le Grand Tango, which was a bit of a stylistic jolt but was fun and forceful right through to Wang’s closing double-handed glissando up the length of the keyboard. There was great virtuosity in this concert, and great musicianship a little more risk-taking was all that was missing.• Yuja Wang is at the Barbican, London, on 31 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c201b0692741cc6f338a13fb40cb2ba87480ca8c/555_0_6805_4084/master/6805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c98be2b0d7fbf26c54961f582ec5e8","title":"kudos leaderboards qoms how fitness app strava became a religion","story":"The Strava app offers community, training data and motivation to millions of athletes. Even runners who dislike tech can’t bear to be without it. By  Rose GeorgeOn Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: “Right then, off you go.” Fell running – making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain – thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don’t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.Yet, at the start of the race, two things happened: 400 feet started to move, and 200 fingers pressed a button on a wristwatch equipped with GPS, setting the devices to record. The moor birds’ cheeps were now accompanied by beeps. When it comes to tracking and measuring runs, and being obsessed with data, we are right up there with the rest of the field. But tracking and measuring were just the start. Soon after finishing the race, most of the runners would upload that GPS data to a digital platform that has changed the world of amateur sport. The fell runners knew, as millions of people worldwide do, that if it isn’t on Strava, it didn’t happen.Strava is a fitness and sports tracking platform that launched in 2009 and bills itself the “number one app for runners and cyclists”. As long as you have a smartphone, watch or bike computer that records your activities using GPS, you can sync it with Strava, then upload your run, cycle, ski or almost any other activity, and be rewarded with astonishing levels of data analysis. For an amateur, the data available from Strava is like having a Team GB coach in your phone, for free.Strava tells me how fast I ran in May 2015 or last Thursday, and how much improvement I have made. Every run I do is recognised and automatically matched to anyone else who has run the same route, or part of it. Athletes – as Strava flatteringly calls its users – can create a “segment”, a portion of a route, perhaps featuring a hill or a stretch of lake, against which other athletes can then match their own efforts. In my local park, I can see how my 2017 self did on a segment someone has named Up the Bloody Hill, or on Stairway to Heaven (actually steps to the car park), or on #Weeeeeeeeeee! My efforts can be scored on “leaderboards” so that I can compare myself with myself, with my Strava followers and friends, or with strangers from Korea to Kansas.Because of Strava, I know how many miles my shoes have covered and whether I need new ones, as the app will email me to tell me (without sending me ads for shoes). After a race, I can launch Strava’s Flyby feature, an ingenious interactive map, and watch my digital self rerun the race route alongside anyone else who ran it. It is addictive, to watch these ghosts in the machine, and see where they got away, or where I caught them up, to see if they went wrong and how badly. For my efforts, I can be given “kudos” by anyone who follows me – the Strava “like”, signified by a thumbs up – and I can do the same for them. I can leave supportive comments and add photos. I can change the name of my activity from the default “morning run” or “lunch ride” to something witty and punning, and it is one of the unwritten rules of Strava that I should.Because of Strava, I also have a ringside seat into how elite athletes train and race: more than half of the Tour de France peloton last year uploaded their stages. I can follow the training of Kílian Jornet, the world’s best mountain runner, or champion distance runner Aly Dixon. Strava has been downloaded by 49 million people in 195 countries, and the company claims it attracts a million new users a month. In total, these people upload 25 activities a second, or 15.3m a week. They share 4 million photos a week and last year gave each other 3.6bn kudos. In the reward loop of Strava, activities get kudos, which encourages more activities. Adding funny names, emojis or photos increases the number of kudos by up to a third. More kudos, more exercise. The more people share their data, the better the experience.The essential goal of any tech platform is to make you use it again. This is called “stickiness”. But one step beyond stickiness is community: the key is to embed a tech platform into someone’s life, including their friends and wider circle of acquaintances and fellow athletes they haven’t even met. Group encouragement is proven to have a positive effect on fitness: users who belong to a club (including virtual ones) upload three times more activities than non-members.Ben Mounsey is a top mountain runner from Yorkshire, and formerly a school photography teacher in Elland, near Halifax. Before he discovered Strava, he was a good enough runner to make national teams. “But I didn’t have any focus. I was just running on natural fumes,” he says. He never kept a diary and could not remember his run times. In 2014, a friend mentioned Strava. He signed up, got a GPS watch and started recording his times. “I became obsessed, from day one,” he says.I don’t consider myself addicted to Strava: I don’t check in unless I’ve done an activity. I don’t get notifications. I have never created a segment and don’t know how to. I would never log into Strava just to browse. And yet, looking at the data has become an essential part of my exercise regime. Once, my phone broke when I was travelling without a computer to hand, and my first action when I got a new one was to manually upload to Strava the runs I had done without it. My data shows I have done 171 runs in the past 12 months: my memory has recorded that I did fewer than half a dozen that weren’t logged. What I don’t know is how a middling, menopausal fell runner, who only began running at the age of 41, and will never win much, got to care so much about any of this.In the mid-90s, two former college friends, Michael Horvath and Mark Gainey, met to discuss an idea. They had been competitive rowers at Harvard, and both missed rowing life: its competition and camaraderie were hard to recreate when they no longer had time for team sports. Gainey and Horvath’s idea was to create a “virtual locker room” where people who exercised alone could still find a community. But the technology wasn’t good enough to build what they wanted. Instead, they founded Kana, a company selling email and marketing software which, at its height, was valued at $10bn (£7.7bn).In 2006, they came up with the idea for a social network for athletes, with “athlete” meaning anyone who took fitness seriously. (Strava’s CEO until November last year, James Quarles, defines an athlete as “anyone who sweats”.) They chose the name Strava, from the Swedish “to strive”. By then, technology had progressed enough for people to carry GPS devices in their pockets, and strap on lightweight heart monitors.Gainey and Horvath had observed that digital sharing was rising at the same time as communal activity was declining. They targeted what they called “avids” – cyclists who rode frequently – and hoped that word would spread. From the beginning, the big hook was the leaderboard, a ranking of anyone who has cycled a particular route. This was not unique, but was borrowed from online gaming. The difference was that this scoreboard was linked to real-world physical activity. Strava offered the competitive draw of segments and the gratification of kudos. There were also rewards: as the quickest rider of any segment, you would be labelled King of the Mountain (KOM) or Queen of the Mountain (QOM). That these prizes are fleeting, lasting only as long as it takes for someone to beat your time, only increased the addictiveness.These features – lures, rewards, competition – are now considered standard in gamification, which apps use to get us to return. Strava’s ace was to combine the competitive appeal of the segment with a community of likeminded people who knew how much it meant to come back from injury or miss a personal best. Add an interface that is widely accepted to be clever, clean and extremely simple to use – along with the increasingly rare situation of being free from ads – and Strava was a hit.The first Strava user was David Belden, a cyclist from California. (He is still on Strava and, in 2019, he covered 1,455.8 miles and climbed almost 40,000 metres.) For the first years, the main users of Strava looked similar to Belden, in that most of them were male and on a bike. Growth was steady. In 2011, Strava offered a separate running app, before merging everything in 2014. Strava staff like to call their product “agnostic” because it doesn’t care what device or app is used to upload data. “We are the Switzerland of tracking platforms,” says Gareth Nettleton, vice-president of marketing at Strava’s UK base in Bristol.Strava is not the most-used fitness app in the world. Runkeeper has 50 million users Runtastic claims more than 147 million registered users and is popular in Europe. Other strong competitors are MapMyRun, Endomondo, Nike+ and Google Fit. Most offer some variety of tracking, recording and sociability. Many are owned by big sports shoe and clothing corporations (Asics, bought Runkeeper in 2016 for $83m Under Armor bought MapMyRun and its 20 million users for $150m).Strava does not sell clothes or shoes. Quarles, former CEO, came from Instagram, where he had introduced ads, but there are no plans to do the same at Strava. More important is building goodwill in the community. “I worked for a long time at the intersection of technology and communities,” he told me on the phone from the US last spring, “and at how technology brings people closer together, not turns into this dystopian thing of them spending time apart.”Strava users may start as loners, only tracking their own activities, but the hope is that they will soon be hooked into tracking friends and peers, and that this will push them to go further and faster. But the friendly competition of a supportive, likeminded community can sometimes lead to darker impulses.Mounsey, the mountain runner, found the segment a powerful addiction. For months, he “went crazy” trying to win every segment within a 10-mile radius. “Everyone hated me for a long time in Elland.” Once, he says, a clubmate took a segment off him on a local steep hill called Trooper Lane. “I couldn’t believe it. I tried not to be bothered by it, I saw it at 7.30pm and by 8pm I was analysing it.” The next morning, he got up an hour earlier than normal, ate nothing, stopped off at Trooper Lane, did a hard session of 35 minutes, beat his clubmate by five minutes, then went to work and fell asleep in the classroom. “I felt really ill, I’d pushed myself so hard, all for a bloody segment, for male pride,” he says. Then adds: “I’m portraying myself as a bit of a psychopath here, aren’t I?”When he found himself running miles on a Sunday just because he hadn’t reached his self-imposed weekly target, he pulled back. “I can see the good and bad in Strava.” (He’s still on it, though. Disclaimer: he is an unpaid Strava ambassador.)Strava says segments don’t just appeal to men, although I have never seen a female runner suddenly set off at speed shouting “segment!” as a male clubmate once did. This pursuit of a record can encourage dangerous impulses. In 2010, a cyclist named William “Kim” Flint was killed chasing a fast downhill segment when his bike, travelling at 40mph, crashed into a car in Oakland, California. (His family sued Strava and lost.) Forbes magazine called this “a quantified-self fatality”. Mountain bikers frequently report being pushed off trails by other bikers descending at speed and yelling “STRAVA!”. In 2016, alarmed by the speeds recorded on Strava segments, a council in Los Altos, California, banned mountain bikers from Byrne Preserve. Strava now lets users flag a segment as hazardous, and its terms of service absolve the company of any responsibility for “known or unknown risks associated with these activities even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Strava”.Once, I got a CR – course record, the equivalent of Queen of the Mountain – on a random stretch of trail in south-west France. This is a rare enough event that I remember it vividly. Within hours, a Strava email alerted me that I had lost the record I immediately logged in to see who had taken it. Then I checked how fast she had run it and compared her time to mine. Then I went to her profile and checked how old she was and all her other activities. A year later, I am still planning to go back to that unremarkable forest track up the hill from Belesta and sprint up a random 400 metres as fast as I possibly can.Strava forums have plenty of fuming users enraged about cheating. E-bike users who “forget” to mark their rides as an e-bike and end up on leaderboard are a growing problem. Taking your GPS watch for a drive is another. In Hong Kong, one user wrote on Strava’s forum: “A large percentage of segments is polluted by people using cars or electric scooters.”Some of this is accidental, as e-bike users have to manually change a setting on Strava to mark their rides as assisted. Some of it is not. An e-biker named Matt May has a profile picture of a bottle of vodka attached to his bike, and delights in annoying Strava purists. There are legitimate third-party apps that claim to help people improve their Strava stats by alerting them, for example, to wind conditions. Then there was the short-lived website Digital EPO (named after erythropoietin, a common illegal drug in sport) that allowed people to alter the GPS data to show they had gone faster than they had in reality. This inflamed plenty of cycling and running forums.On his podcast, the California-based ultra-endurance athlete Rich Roll hints at why what people post on Strava matters: “There’s something uniquely special about being privy to the daily grind of my favorite multi-sport athletes. Their transparency holds me accountable. In turn, I help hold my community accountable. And openly sharing our collective fitness experience – the highs and the lows – makes all of us better.”I did once report a cheat. Strava lets you do this by “flagging” a suspect activity, such as a ride or run that has clearly been done in a car, or on an e-bike. Why did I care? It was a woman who had apparently run a stretch of my local park in about 10 seconds. I cared because I had just run that same stretch and it had taken more than two minutes. I cared because it was physically impossible to do what her upload said. I am never going to be an elite athlete. I am competitive, but only with myself, and only because I want to disprove the idea that a 50-year-old woman cannot improve. Yet, suddenly, when I saw that improbable segment, I was seven years old again and someone had cheated in the playground. My emotions had the purity of childish rage, that white heat of unfairness. I flagged the segment, which meant she would have been given an option to delete it, which she did. I’m not sure if I felt bigger or smaller for doing it. (I’m lying. I would do it again.)Brazilians are social, and they also love sport, making Brazil a perfect society for Strava (they also like to work out with their family, unlike any other country). The French are equally into running and cycling Germans prefer bikes. Strava’s yearly data report offers other revelations. The most active day of 2018 for German cyclists was 6 May for French cyclists it was 9 September. Americans ran more on 23 November than on any other day in 2018 Japanese runners were busiest on 16 September. Globally, most people exercise on a Sunday except in the UK and Ireland, where we prefer Tuesday. Runners talk about beer in their activity uploads cyclists talk more about coffee. From Strava data, the media concluded that the second week in January is “quitters’ week”, when newly active users give up (although women will last two days longer than men).This data also offers a “heat map” – a record of activities in any given area. In 2018 Strava’s global heat map, a record of 1bn activities worldwide, accidentally revealed the location of secret US military bases, because personnel had uploaded their activities to Strava and failed to opt out of heat maps. Fitness tracking data can have other uses: one user concluded her boyfriend was cheating by noticing how often his Strava rides were done in the company of another woman. Fitbit and Apple Watch data has been used to solve murders (in one case, showing that the victim’s heart rate had spiked during the suspect’s visit and been silent thereafter). Those that opt in to Strava heat maps become a saleable product. Under a project called , Strava sells anonymised data to cities about where and when its users ride and run and exercise. More than 70 cities have used  in the US states of Colorado, New Hampshire, and in the UK as have academic and non-profit organisations such as Glasgow University’s Urban Big Data Centre. Strava offers a paid subscription called Summit with additional features – more heart data, the ability to filter leaderboards by age and weight, and a useful location-tracking feature called Beacon – for about £4.50 a month. The company doesn’t release figures about how many of its athletes pay for Summit, but it is thought to be a percentage in single figures.Athletes who use products from companies with whom Strava has set up commercial partnerships now find their activities attached to a banner proclaiming that they “ran with Suunto” or cycled with Zwift. For the first time this year, Strava’s Year in Sport report included a section on “the world’s hottest gear”, a list of the most popular brands used by people on the platform. It is not an ad, but it smells like one. “Wahoo doesn’t sponsor me,” said one user in Strava’s forum, among many objectors. “There is no reason I should be forced to sponsor them.”When we spoke in early 2019, Quarles was optimistic that profitability wasn’t far off, but he was suddenly replaced in November 2019 by co-founder Mark Gainey, with Michael Horvath also returning to an active role. Strava also lost its high-profile chief technology officer, Stephanie Hannon, who had been digital chief for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, after only a year. There are a few options for Strava to make money: becoming a subscription-only service, selling up, selling its users to advertisers, or selling more data than it does currently ( data is anonymised, and Strava’s terms of service say that users own their data, but that they grant Strava a huge licence to use it).Perhaps the golden years of this clever, uncommercial app being available for free are numbered. But Strava is still a beacon of positivity among the bile and manipulation of other social media. Trolling is rare and usually only takes the form of excessive kudos from randoms – and what’s wrong with that? I get regular abuse on Twitter on Strava, I have never had anything but encouragement. The company says its currency is effort, but it is also largely goodwill. The platform’s privacy controls now are good enough that I can hide my home and my place of work, and I can stay off leaderboards. I could stay off Strava, too, but I don’t intend to. It is a guidebook and a corkboard (posting photos, Strava believes, enables powerful “memorialisation” of activities). It is training log, chat room and map room. And in these days of public carping and rage, it is something I prize more than race prizes: it is a refuge.Richard Askwith, a British writer and fell runner, is the author of Running Free, a book about the over-commercialisation and datafication of running. He gave up running with a smartwatch years ago. “I think if I was constantly wanting to tell other people about my runs I would be losing out on the experience of the run itself. If you’re running off-road, then you’re inhabiting your environment and you’re sensing how your step feels and you’re thinking about where your next step is going to go. Then if you want to think about how much effort you’re putting in, you just sort put your foot on the pedal a bit, but it’s all subjectively measured.”Or, as one cyclist who had given up quantifying wrote: “I remember when cycling used to be fun.”The British Medical Journal provides a service assessing some fitness apps. Its entry on Strava lists the obvious pros (it’s free, it’s easy to set up, it encourages users to push harder than they would alone). The writer also warned of the cons: “Owing to the competitive nature installed in users of the app, risk-taking behaviours may be increased that could lead to musculoskeletal injury or road traffic collisions.” Also, “one may forget what a leisurely bike ride or jog used to feel like.” A paper presented at the Royal Geographical Society in London in 2013 by Dr Paul Barratt of Staffordshire University suggested that Strava was, perversely, making group rides antisocial, as riders concentrated on winning segments from virtual strangers rather than focusing on their fellow riders in real life.Fell runner Tim Dempsey gave up using technology on the hills three years ago. “Thinking forward to the completed run on-screen while running, only to finish and use the screen to look back. It removes you utterly from the moment. Two years on. I still look at my naked wrist for cues.”“I love it and hate it in equal measure,” says the runner and coach Anji Andrews. “It’s great for logging training and keeping track of pace, routes, mileage. It’s horrific in being, to many, just an online log of excuses and encouraging comparison (the thief of joy).”Recently, on occasion, I have forgotten to wear my GPS watch at races and runs. At races, I experienced mild concern: if it is not recorded, then how will I know how fast I have run? How will my miles count towards my yearly 1,000-mile target? But then I set off, on a recreational or competitive run, and something happens. I feel freer. I run across moorland and stop to look around, and don’t worry about pausing my watch, about someone later looking at my data and seeing that I stopped for a gawp of the purple heather and the eerie calm of the stone circle. I walk for a bit and revel in not being recorded. No one is looking. No one cares.At the biggest race in my calendar, the Yorkshire Three Peaks, I didn’t dare leave my watch behind. I had certain cut-offs – set times – to reach, so I needed to know what the time was. But as I set off up Pen-y-Ghent, I did something strange, and turned my watch to the inside of my wrist. That made it slightly harder to check, and so I hardly checked it. I ran according to feel, as the training term goes, and despite hailstorms and cramp and only looking at my watch three times over 23 miles, I got the best time I had ever done.Maybe I had learned to pace myself so well by using tech that I could do it without? I was a fell running equivalent of Luke Skywalker in his X-wing fighter, switching off the targeting system and feeling the Force. Unchained from data, I felt free and powerful. And within a couple of hours of finishing, after sitting among my real life running friends in the race marquee, all of us glowing with achievement, and scoffing stew in likeminded company, I uploaded the run to Strava. How else would I get any kudos?• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/612650666facab7182722f84dc82f8f4aa58003d/0_194_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16dfa16e20635af3ef17e4a7f3a02684","title":"why did former nissan boss carlos ghosn choose a life on the run podcast","story":"The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people.

Almost as if the producers didn’t quite trust the prime minister not to back out of his first televised interview since the election and wanted to shame him into going through with it. Or at the very least to have footage of him sneaking out a rear window.But for once Boris Johnson was as good as his word and shortly after 8am the BBC’s Dan Walker found himself face to face with a figure who looked as if he had just tumbled out of bed.Let’s start with Iran, said Walker. Boris clasped his knees tightly, trying desperately to remember exactly where Iran was and why it was important. It was quite early in the morning. Then it came to him. “I don’t want a military conflict,” he said hesitantly. A decent enough start, given the circumstances – it will have come as a huge relief to a lot of people who might have been expecting him to declare war.Gradually Johnson’s brain began to engage with itself. If not always with reality. He had been out of the country when the US had launched its drone strike on Qassem Suleimani, he said. On holiday, Walker reminded him. Yes, and Trump had sent him a Whatsapp message telling him to watch repeats of the attack on Fox News, but he hadn’t picked it up till much later as the wifi at the private bar on the beach was a bit iffy.And no, he hadn’t for a minute thought of showing some leadership and coming home. How many more times in his life was he going to be offered a £20K-a-week villa on Mustique for absolutely nothing?Sensing the interview was taking a turn for the worse, Boris reverted to his default position under pressure of making up policy as he went along. What really needed to happen next was for the US to come up with its own nuclear deal and then Iran, the UK and the other signatories could just tear up up the old Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The same JCPOA that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, had spent 45 minutes defending in the Commons the previous day.Walker kindly changed the subject before Boris could do any more damage.“You’ve never dodged tricky issues in the past,” Walker now observed. Even Boris appeared shocked by this. He had spent a whole lifetime dodging the difficult questions. Especially when they are being asked by Andrew Neil or the Today programme. Or his close family.But this time it turned out that the tricky question concerned Harry and Meghan’s future. Boris visibly relaxed. He clearly doesn’t care one way or the other and is merely relieved that the royals are giving him a bit of respite from the media spotlight. I’m sure they will work something out, he mumbled.Walker then moved on to Brexit. “Your favourite subject,” he added. Now a rare moment of honesty escaped the prime minister’s lips. “Actually, it’s my least favourite subject,” he replied. Because every mention of it is a reminder of just how many lies he has told and of the reckoning he fears is to come.But just as quickly, he retreated for cover – his tragedy is that he both longs to be seen yet knows he cannot survive the exposure – and went into full pifflepafflewifflewaffle. He was epically confident of getting a full trade deal. Very, very, very, confident. As in not confident at all. He was winging it again. With Johnson the probability of something happening is in inverse proportion to the hyperbole.“Bung a bob for Big Ben bongs,” Boris bumbled. Alliteration cuts both ways. It would cost £500K to ring Big Ben on 31 January, but if there were enough people out there who were willing to stump up for the pleasure then he wouldn’t rule it out. After all, he had wasted £40m on a garden bridge that was never going to be built so he was no one to tell people how to spend their dosh. Besides, it was as close to a Brexit idend as anyone was likely to get.Boris did his best to talk over and distract Walker throughout the rest of the interview by talking nonsense – anything to run the clock down. But there was no disguising the fact we were watching a prime minister close to free fall in his free association. There’s a reason therapists often like to see their patients early in the morning. It’s because then they are less well defended and shrinks get to see the real person. The timing of the interview was turning out to be the biggest masterstroke of all.“In the past few days we’ve done a couple more things that we’ve done,” was the closest to coherence Boris could manage. When asked what he planned to do in the next year for former Labour voters from the Midlands and the north he couldn’t really come up with anything but repeat previously discredited lies about building 40 new hospitals this year, next year, sometime, never.He even forgot that he was already supposed to have a plan for social care provision in place and instead announced a proposal to come up with a plan at some point in the future. His only real commitment was to end the county (drugs) lines. Though he clearly hadn’t a clue how. It was like watching a panicky child think out loud.By now Walker was looking increasingly disturbed. He wrapped things up with a gentle lob about veganuary. This was the breaking of Boris. The floodgates opened. He needed to lose weight, he sobbed. But he couldn’t do without cheese. Life without cheese was a crime against humanity. Nor did he have the concentration to go vegan. Or the self-discipline. After all, it wasn’t as if these were qualities a country might reasonably expect of its prime minister."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4846e73088f977dbc4a8b9e4e839eb74b2b01bc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1dba4eb9a7d4e63f486b661a457466e","title":"i finally had control it was my account starting over again in emergency accommodation","story":"For a woman staying in refuge, sorting out a new bank account is made all the more difficult when you can’t reveal the addressI suffered domestic abuse for several years when I was with my husband. The abuse would be in the house, but in front of others he would act completely differently. I was trapped, too frightened to leave, given all that he had done to me and threatened to do. He controlled every aspect of my life, including the finances. He set up a joint account, but the Jobseeker’s Allowance came in his name and only he accessed that account. I would have to ask him for money, even for basic essentials.After many years I eventually found a way to leave him.

Then in the final appointment they said the manager had now refused because I didn’t have an address. I was so upset and frustrated. It was like I didn’t matter, nobody cared. It was humiliating and again I had no control. I was worried how I would manage without the universal credit money. I had to feed my children. We had been surviving with support from my family and donations.Staff at the refuge then told me that HSBC UK had started a new way to open an account for women in refuges, a way in which we did not have to give the refuge address.

During the appointment I did think they would say no at any moment, but when they said the account was open I was so relieved.I finally had control. It was my account.

Curran himself was caught in the usual hotfoot circuit from training to team meeting to fevered personal prep.This wasn’t the problem, though.

At the end of which Curran’s message to the U13s was, it should be said, an extremely good short video message.“I hope I might end up playing with some of you one day,” he said at the end, a moment of slight double-take for the pre-teens present, unaware perhaps that Curran himself was still playing under-17 trophy matches just four years ago, usually batting in the middle-order alongside a fellow called Ollie Pope.It is a measure of how connected Curran remains to his roots at a club that really did become a surrogate family and, indeed, how strikingly young he still is, a youthfulness that can disguise the fact his career to date is a triumph of will over physical reality.Here we have a 5ft 9in skiddy medium-fast bowler, slight of stature and slight of red-ball experience, who has at no stage looked as though he doesn’t understand Test cricket perfectly, rolling in with demonic intent, the wiliest 21-year-old veteran in town.Fast forward to this week and England’s Test winter has taken a slight upturn. As have Curran’s own acquisitive England returns. Port Elizabeth will be his sixth consecutive England Test. In the previous five Curran has taken 20 wickets at 25, and often changed the tempo or the tone of an innings in the process.Not that you’d notice particularly, given the headline selection-clamour this week, the more thrilling, adrenal question of which 90mph new ball bowler is about to return and take the new ball in the wake of Jimmy Anderson’s injury.Usefully poised, working the percentages: it is a fitting place for this most disruptive, genre-hopping of junior cricketers, a Test player who still seems to be in a process of realignment, of self-definition.Understanding Sam Curran. It is a process that appears to have some way left to run, at least for those who seek only the classic tropes, the five-fors and tons of the canonical Test all-rounder.The problem is, perhaps, a tendency to start by stating what Curran is not, a list of absences that seems to rule out pretty much every role in the “nuclear” Test template. Curran is not a genuine all-rounder. He’s not a frontline batsman. He’s not a frontline bowler. He’s not a wicketkeeper. He’s not, come to think of it, a particularly good fielder.Here we have a cricketer of not-quites, a collage carved from off-cuts. And yet Curran has an undeniable solidity, and a sense of tangible influence exerted. In a time of retrenchment England have won 10 and lost four of the 15 Tests the not-quite all-rounder has played, as opposed to three wins and three losses in seven without him. Still though. It’s not just that, is it?England have learned a bit more about Curran of late. He needs the new ball to see the best of his bowling. He can bowl intense, nibbly spells when it gets older. He gets top-order batsmen out. At the same time his batting has fallen away. As Duncan Fletcher noted in a recent interview, he seems impatient, always counterattacking.But it’s not that either. It may be comforting to flag up progress towards a more traditional metric, the idea new-ball five-fors might be just around the corner for a player who wasn’t much of a bowler coming up, who Surrey have always seen as more of a batsman.In reality Curran is something else, something new. He is perhaps best seen as an episodic player. Test cricket has changed in recent times, becoming not just shorter but more varied in its rhythms: a game of surges and counter surges, of intense, decisive passages.This is what Curran has been good at. Not bowling or batting all day, taking the entire contest one way with some slow burn Herculean act, but winning those moments. He still has no five-for, no hundred, the traditional pounds and shillings of Test match achievement. But he has a bowling average under 30 and batting average close to it, and has still had a say in the winning of matches.Look around and Test match all-rounders of the old school are all but extinct in any case. According to the ICC rankings the best Test all-rounders now are Jason Holder, Ravi Jadeja, Ben Stokes, Vernon Philander, Ravichandran Ashwin and Mitchell Starc. Curran is down at 13, just ahead of Kemar Roach. Of these players only Stokes qualifies as a “classic” Beefy-Imran-Kapil kind of all-rounder, and even Stokes is a player of moments, an episode player whose worth falls outside his headline stats.But then, to be an all-rounder now is to play across formats as much as different skill sets. A cricketer like Curran must find enough surplus brilliance, not to mention enough practice time to master six different ways of batting and bowling.The only sensible response is to become effective, polyvalent, adaptable. Curran will get back to doing this in Port Elizabeth, and with an eye on adding some runs for the first time this winter. If England are to build on the triumphs of Cape Town he will, you suspect, be standing close to the centre of things involved as ever in winning those moments."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6eb98faefb69252ffc4960951beea58b7ab9d89/0_166_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b3e644898ff8eaba287717d25d1b431","title":"cardinal denies manipulating pope benedict over priestly celibacy","story":"Move comes after claims he was manipulated into writing an attack on successor FrancisThe former pope Benedict XVI has requested the removal of his name as the co-author of a controversial new book in which he spoke out against allowing married men to become priests as a dispute over its publication gripped the Vatican for a third day.“I can confirm that this morning I acted on instructions from the emeritus pope and I asked Cardinal Robert Sarah to contact the book’s publishers and request them to remove Benedict XVI’s name as co-author of the book and remove his signature from the introduction and the conclusions too,” the retired pontiff’s personal secretary, Georg Gänswein, told the Italian news agency Ansa on Tuesday.Benedict’s intervention in the book From the Depths of Our Hearts has come weeks before his reform-minded successor Francis is expected to publish a document on whether married men may be ordained in the Amazon as a solution to a priest shortage there.The controversy over the book underscores the conservative-progressive battle lines that have exploded in the Catholic church following Benedict’s decision in 2013 to become the first pope in 600 years to retire.Extracts of the book published by France’s Le Figaro newspaper on Sunday ignited a fresh round of briefings from backers of the current pope and traditionalists nostalgic for Benedict’s orthodoxy. The book is published in France on Wednesday.Francis’s supporters claimed the increasingly frail Benedict, 92, had been manipulated by members of his rightwing entourage into writing something that amounted to a frontal attack on Francis.Sarah, who heads the Vatican’s liturgy office and co-authored the book with Benedict, posted to Twitter a series of letters from the former pope late on Monday making clear he had written the text and approved its publication after news reports quoting “sources close to Benedict” claimed he never saw or approved the finished product.“I solemnly affirm that Benedict XVI knew that our project would take the form of a book. I can say that we exchanged many drafts to make corrections,” he said.Gänswein, however, told Ansa that “Benedict did not approve a project for a co-authored book and he had not seen or authorised the cover” and therefore asked the publishers to remove Benedict’s name from the cover, the introduction and the conclusion.“The pope emeritus knew that the cardinal was preparing a book and he sent him a text on the priesthood authorising him to use it as he wanted. But he did not approve a project for a co-authored book, and he had not seen or authorised the cover.”Gänswein said it was “a misunderstanding that does not raise questions about Cardinal Sarah’s good faith”.Sarah tweeted minutes later that future publications of the book would name him as the sole author “with the contribution of Benedict XVI”.“Considering the controversies that provoked the publication of the book From the Depths of Our Hearts, it is decided that the author of the book will be for the further publications: Cardinal Sarah, with the contribution of Benedict XVI,” he said. “However, the full text remains absolutely unchanged.”Benedict’s intervention had been seen as surprising since he had vowed to live “hidden from the world” when he retired in 2013, specifically to avoid any suggestion that he still wielded papal authority. He has come forward on various issues over the past seven years, but this is the first time he has intervened on a matter that the more liberal Pope Francis is actively considering.The Vatican insisted the book was a mere “contribution” to the discussion about priestly celibacy written by two bishops in “filial obedience” to Francis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b7292a2e72961cccfdf5e91f069f61ae8046726/0_391_7360_4418/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6f9fb00010b6f1dd7ba1004f6cd865","title":"dream job hundreds apply to work on remote irish island","story":"Caretaker jobs on Great Blasket, Ireland’s most westerly point, draw responses from Alaska to South AfricaIf a demanding job on a tiny island with no electricity, wifi or hot showers but lots of wind sounds tempting, join the queue.An advert for two caretakers to manage accommodation and a cafe on Great Blasket island, off Ireland’s Atlantic coast, has drawn queries from Alaska to South Africa.The posts, which run from 1 April to 1 October this year, include free accommodation and food and spectacular views off Ireland’s most westerly point.“It’s intense and tough but it’s a very unique position,” Alice Hayes, who placed the advert, told RTE on Tuesday. “It’s back to basics – fires, candles, stoves, wildlife and nature.” The ideal candidates had to get on well so the job would suit two friends or a couple, and they had to be fit, personable and chatty, she said. “No day is ever the same.”The caretakers will have to run three cottages, accommodating up to 21 people, and serve tea, coffee and snacks to visitors. Water is boiled in whistling kettles on gas hobs. A small wind turbine generates enough electricity to charge a phone. “So you are not completely cut off,” said Hayes. She did not disclose the wages.Great Blasket is part of the Blasket islands, the five other main islands being Beginish, Inishabro, Inishvickillane, Inishtooskert and Tearaght, off the coast of Kerry.Close-knit communities of Irish speakers eked a living here for centuries, farming, fishing and weaving. Emigration shrivelled the population and in 1953 the government evacuated the last fulltime residents.Last year’s caretakers were Lesley Kehoe and Gordon Bond, a couple who quit jobs and demanding commutes in Dublin for what they considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.Towards the end of their stint they stopped posting pictures and messages on social media, citing unkind responses they attributed to jealousy or meanness.“People are very protective of the island life, people who were saying they knew more about the Great Blasket than us, who were accusing us of commercialising it, saying we were going to attract more tourists to the island and ruin it, criticising us for not speaking Irish,” Kehoe told the .The comments had affected her, she said. “Being on the island was a perfect experience, and any kind of negativity was taking away from it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73e44b1afb686bc6019786618c4f18cfc08833d2/0_227_6880_4129/master/6880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57b66730fcdba8975e3503f6fe2670ee","title":"janelle monae non binary pronouns they them","story":"Janelle Monáe just came out as non-binary, joining a growing number of people who use ‘theythem’ as pronouns. You might be wondering how to address themMonáe’s tweet came after the recent announcement of Sam Smith, who recently said they felt “just as much a woman as I am man”. Both celebrities joined the increasing number of young people who identify neither as male or female.Non-binary people tend to prefer using theythem pronouns (although not exclusively – some use she and he interchangeably). If gender neutral pronouns intimidate you, you’re not the only one. As someone who is new to using them (a number of my friends have recently started to identify as non-binary), I confess it can be intimidating when you want to respect someone’s wishes without making any blunders.Putting someone’s dignity before my shyness about how to use a pronoun is, of course, the bare minimum. But I admit to having made mistakes – even avoiding using pronouns in the past, for fear of getting it wrong.It really isn’t that hard, however, to get it right. Reasons for choosing gender neutral pronouns are complex and personal. Some people do it because they don’t feel they fit into a gender. For others, it’s a form of protest: they contest rigid gender expectations and would rather live without them. Being gender non-conforming, right down to their pronouns, is how they choose to identify.So please, if you learn someone uses theythem pronouns, don’t respond: “We get it OK – she’s gay!” – as my friend’s parents recently did.It is normal in the English language to use theythem pronouns when we don’t know the gender of the person to which we’re referring, or if we want our sentence to be applicable to all genders.This isn’t new – the saying “Everybody loves their own mother” has been used since around late 1300. Both Jane Austen and Geoffrey Chaucer – who died in 1400 - used pronouns that way.While it is no longer grammatically incorrect to use theythem as singular anymore, people still get confused about it. A friend’s parent recently responded to their pronouns, saying: “But if I tell Shelly you’re coming round for dinner, she’ll think you’re bringing extra people!”Try this: if you are using the pronoun in a scenario where there is no confusion over singular versus plural, just go ahead and use it (“You are going to meet my friend Poppy today, I hope you like them”).If you are using it in an instance where it might be misconstrued as plural, you can change the first part of the sentence to make it clear (“I may bring a friend, their name is Poppy”).If you still feel that is confusing, you can be explicit (“I asked Poppy – who uses theythem pronouns – they might come”). This also takes the onus off your non-binary friend for having to explain it themselves later.Avoid assuming every person’s gender. Feel free to ask people when you meet them what pronouns they use. Feel free to put your own pronouns in your email signature, or to introduce people using your pronouns (this can take the focus off non-binary people having to do all the work).Embrace doing your own research on pronouns, without expecting non-binary people to educate you. Encourage open dialogue, which means being open about your own shortcomings or fears, when relevant. Ensure this is a means to steer conversation forward (“Hey, did I get that right just then?”) not back (“Well actually this is pretty scary for me, so you shouldn’t correct me”).People may use your respect for another’s pronouns as a means to argue with you about the broader political context around gender andor LGBTQ rights. But you don’t need to be needlessly drawn into an argument unless that’s where you want to go. Briefly explain why you are doing it, and if the challenge escalates, consider shutting down the conflict (“It’s my choice to respect their wishes” or even the more direct “I don’t want to argue about this”).When you make a mistake, apologize, be gracious, and move on. Generally people aren’t out to get you. Don’t get too hung up: my experience is that people know getting it wrong is part of the process and are forgiving if they feel you are trying your best.Sometimes you can check that you said the right thing first, rather than getting caught up in your head (“Hey, when I said that, was it offensive?’). Above all, recognize mistakes happen and apologies are OK, but don’t mistake them for real work. Saying sorry a handful of times might be fine, but if you’re misgendering someone over and over again you might want to think about why, and do better.Exposure is key. Keep using theythem, and soon it will feel normal. That’s the aim."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80101a34cd51c442f0cec8ae998a6f84dcaa12ca/100_509_7190_4314/master/7190.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec4d997accc134c80dfad8958bb4b5e8","title":"school lunch liberia london","story":"By providing free school meals to some of the poorest children on Earth, a UK charity is also ensuring they get an education by  Joanna Moorhead in Tubmanburg and Monrovia, LiberiaIt’s breakfast time in Domagbamatma (population: 63) in the depths of the Liberian rainforest, but there’s no food in evidence in the home of Massa Kamara. The eight-year-old has been up since dawn, collecting firewood, fetching water.Now she’s ready for school in a crisp white shirt and navy-blue skirt in her family’s muddy, two-room shack.In the narrow porch there’s a pile of rags, some carrier bags, a few bowls and a couple of plastic chairs. In a UK home it would look like stuff waiting to go to the tip. Here, it represents this family’s entire earthly possessions.Liberia is one of the poorest countries on Earth, and the Kamaras are one of its poorest families. They eke out a living growing vegetables on the land around the shack.In families that hover as close to subsistence as this one, sending their children to school makes little sense. Learning to read and write, to do addition and subtraction, might be an investment in a long-term future, but it doesn’t put food on the table today or tomorrow.And yet Massa is setting off on the 40-minute trek to school. This morning it’s dry: when the rain is pouring down, as it often does at this time of year, Massa carries her uniform in an old carrier bag to keep it dry, and changes into it when she reaches school. As we walk she speaks of the subject she likes best (English), her friends, and how she hopes one day to move to the city.At the Vorkor public school in a village near the regional centre Tubmanburg, smoke is curling from an open-sided “kitchen”, where several women are busy over a fire preparing today’s dinner in vast pots. In a couple of hours’ time, Massa, who has an old margarine tub in her bag, will line up with her classmates to have it filled with rice and beans. At Vorkor, mealtime isn’t just an important part of the pupils’ day: it’s the most important part of the day. And it’s because her family know she will receive a nutritious meal here that they make sure Massa never misses school.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThree thousand miles away, at roughly the same time, pupils at Good Shepherd primary in west London are also sitting down to their lunch and though they don’t know Massa and haven’t even heard of Vorkor school, pupils at the two schools are crucially connected. Because students at Good Shepherd are fundraisers for Mary’s Meals, the NGO that funds school dinners at Vorkor and 2,357 other schools in 18 countries across the world. And while the charity’s supporters come from across the entire community, in the UK and elsewhere, there’s something particularly heartwarming about the idea of kids in one part of the world trying to make things fairer for children somewhere else.That’s very much how it’s seen at Good Shepherd primary, according to the school’s headteacher, Imogen Lavelle. “We believe it’s our duty to help schools in countries such as Liberia,” she says. “So far we’ve raised more than £3,000 – the children have had own-clothes days, wear-your-pyjamas-to-school days, cake sales.”That £3,000 will go a long way: it costs Mary’s Meals the astonishingly small sum of £13.90 to feed a child for a whole school year, so the Good Shepherd is feeding a school of roughly the same sort of size as it is, around 250 pupils, from one end of the academic year to the other. That means a lot to Good Shepherd pupils such as Nathan Olano, 10, who’s in Year 6.It gives children at Good Shepherd plenty of food for thought. “I sometimes think about what it would be like to go to school and get no lunch,” says Nathan’s classmate Darcie Meade, also 10. “Especially if you’ve had no breakfast either. Raising money for schoolchildren in countries like Liberia has made me a lot more aware of how the world is stacked against some communities.”Evi Chaudhari, also 10, says it’s given her hope – not just for children like Massa, but for her entire generation across the planet. “It makes me feel that if we can change the world while we’re still kids, how much more can we do when we’re older?”“One meal for one child costs just 7p – that’s pocket money even the youngest children have,” says Kim Webster, a spokesperson for Mary’s Meals. At a time when development often seems overwhelmingly complex and expensive, the easy digestibility and comparative cheapness of the need to feed and educate children is a big part of its success. And Mary’s Meals manages to keep overheads low by recruiting volunteers – in practice these are usually mothers or grandmothers with kids in the relevant school – to run their kitchens.Even in the regions and schools that Mary’s Meals support, the terrain and weather conditions sometimes make food deliveries impossible. On one recent morning in Liberia, a river connection to a remote local school was impassable because of rains. Bags of porridge, rice and beans that had been stacked up on the bank for the short voyage were loaded back into a vehicle. Across the water we could see the faces of children who would be getting no school dinner until the water receded.Food is not the only challenge for young people in Liberia.One of the kindergarten children at Kondh school in Bomi County is Blessing Johnson, four. Her mother, Ma-tenneh, died of Ebola the day after she was born a week later, her father, Molu, died of it, too. Blessing is being raised by her mother’s sister, Zoe, who already has four children of her own to know her niece is getting fed at school makes a huge difference to the family.Before Ebola, of course, there was civil war, 14 years of it, in which more than 200,000 Liberians died and more than 1 million were uprooted.At another school, there is a boy who’s much older than anyone else called Waharbu Zinah. He’s 19, but he’s only been at school for six years. At the age of three he was kidnapped from his village by soldiers, and even after the war ended in 2003 he was effectively enslaved. “I looked after the man who had been the boss-man of the soldiers I had to fetch and carry for him,” he explains. “I was just a small kid – I had no chance on my own.” He finally escaped when he was 13, and settled in Lowah he works on a farm to support himself.“I don’t expect to see my parents again – I’ve no idea what happened to them. The only way I can have a future is if I provide one for myself – and I’m doing my best to do that.” Getting fed at school, he tells me, is the deal-breaker that makes it possible for him to afford to be educated, and furthers his dream of one day going to college.Seeing Waharbu’s tall frame squeezed behind a dilapidated desk, paying careful attention to the young man just a few years older than him who’s teaching reading from the school’s single blackboard, is a humbling experience. He may not be the sort of pupil the children at the Good Shepherd have in mind when they’re fundraising, but what Mary’s Meals is offering him is the most important gift of all: a second chance.Mary’s Meals paid for Joanna Moorhead’s visit to Liberia"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Can you put the facts about yourself together to see what picture may emerge?College application process can seem intimidating and complex \u0026ndash here\u0026rsquos how to do itA reduction in the artificially inflated range of choices would lead to lower drop-out ratesEmployers will be interested in your range of problem-solving and lateral thinking skillsParents\u0026rsquo perception of the education options for their children are often outdatedAs numbers of students choosing to study abroad increase, we look at the optionsThe costs of college are particularly high for students living in rented or student accommodationPrimary and secondary school may be expensive, but costs climb sharply at third levelWhat do Ireland\u0026rsquos universities offer students by way of sports and health facilities?Download PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139589.1579018174!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"m7 upgrade speed restrictions to be lifted on new three lane carriageway","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWorks on sections of the   M7 upgrade are ongoing. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Speed restrictions on the new three-lane carriageway on the M7 motorway in Co Kildare will be lifted in mid February, according to the latest project update from Kildare County Council.The M7 Naas widening scheme was originally due to have been completed last April, with the Sallins bypass and Osberstown interchange due to be completed later this year.But in the latest update issued on Tuesday, the council said the works would now be completed by mid- February.The announcement means the temporary 80 kmh speed limit remains in place on the M7.Final works on the M7 include drainage at Junction 10 Newhall and at a number of verge locations at Newhall and Lewistown.The council said “pending completion of these works, and in the interests of both worker and public safety, the temporary 80 kmh speed limit is being maintained.”The council said, however, that traffic on the M7 would not be able to use the new interchange at Osberstown to access Naas until the Sallins bypass opens.All three lanes of the upgraded M7 are currently operating at a reduced speed limit of 80kmh from junction eight Johnstown to the M7M9 interchange at junction 11.Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) said the M7 remains an “active construction site”.Construction began on widening a 13.5km stretch of the M7 in January of 2018. It was originally anticipated by the contractors SIAC and Colas that all three lanes would be in operation in both directions by last April.Figures from TII show 14,500 speeding fines have been issued along the road over a period of about 18 months to last August.Local District Court Judge Desmond Zaidan and the Courts Service have both raised concerns over how to deal with the increase in cases arising from the speed checks.The M7 is used by some 78,000 vehicles per day.The upgrade project also involved the replacement and relocation of the existing ramps at Junction 10 Naas South Newhall to the main Naas Newbridge dual carriageway, the construction of a new interchange at Osberstown and a new Sallins bypass."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Study finds clothes washed in colder water last longer, with less energy used for cleaningTaoiseach says now is the best time for vote as President Higgins dissolves 32nd D\u0026aacuteilState Examinations Commission paper illuminates process of grade consistencyMark Tims pleads guilty to manslaughter but not guilty to murder of his fatherSix per cent of images depict torture or bestialityFianna F\u0026aacuteil and Fine Gael will be looking to gain seats for prime position in next governmentCouncils aim to tackle inevitable consequences of climate disruptionDecision by Matt Murphy and Michael O\u0026rsquoSullivan drew significant media attentionWhy is it on a Saturday?

This is unusual - recent elections have all been held on a Friday, and before that they were held on Thursdays. It paves the way for a campaign that will be three-and-a-half weeks long - though it may feel longer.Like the last two general elections, a February poll, and a campaign fought not on long summer evenings - as Varadkar had initially suggested - but in the dark, wet and cold of winter.That will enhance the importance of the “air war” - a campaign fought in the media and over the airwaves - while the “ground war” of knocking on doors and personally engaging voters will be more difficult.Difficult but still important - election studies consistently emphasise the importance in the Irish electoral system of personal approaches to voters. For all the complaints that they are insulated from the lives of ordinary people, Irish politicians in all parties remain remarkably close to the electorate.Extreme anxietyIf they don’t, they lose their seats. All politicians suffer from extreme anxiety about their own seats at election time.Campaigning will be frantic and cacophonous in the coming days as the parties stake out their territory and attack their opponents.Party managers will be opening up their campaign headquarters today and rolling out the message and activity grids they have finalised in recent weeks and which plot out the daily business of the campaigns for all parties.The big two parties will slug it out on their respective records in government and their plans for the future. Elections are about the future, but the credibility of the parties’ promises is influenced greatly by their behaviour in the past.The smaller parties will seek to elbow their way into the debate with sharp and distinctive messages.They’ll get less airtime and fewer column inches than the big parties, so making full use of the coverage they do get is imperative. Spinning from everyone will be dialled up to the maximum immediately.Polls suggest the most open election in many years. The last Ipsos MRBI poll in October gave Fine Gael a small lead, but figures in both big parties accept that there is little between them.Both reckon they can gain seats - but who can gain the most? Fine Gael goes into the campaign with 47 seats, Fianna Fáil with 46, but all the Fianna Fáil TDs are standing for re-election, whereas Fine Gael has several high profile retirees, like Michael Noonan, Enda Kenny and Sean Barrett.‘Coalitionology’And neither of the big parties will come anywhere near the 80 seats required for a majority when the new Dáil meets. That means that the question of how and with whom the next government is formed - derided by Micheál Martin during the last election as “coalitionology” - will be a central one for this campaign. Both big parties are ruling out Sinn Féin, a stance they will be repeatedly required to justify.But the Greens (especially), Labour, the Social Democrats, independents and small parties will also be required to spell out their intentions.A long period of government formation is likely to follow the meeting of a new Dáil, with the numbers dictating the realm of the possible. A return to some form of confidence and supply is not impossible.The transformation of the Irish political landscape as a result of the economic crash of 2008-2011 has meant that government formation is now a much more difficult business.In a way, there are two phases in deciding the future leadership of the country - the election, in which the voters get their say, and then the construction of the new government, in which it’s over to the politicians.The winner of the first phase has the advantage in the second.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139640.1579020819!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 all you need to know about the upcoming general election","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar will remain Taoiseach until the new Dáil is formed. Photograph: Tom HonanThe When is the general election happening? Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced the general election will be held on Saturday, February 8th. He met with President Michael D Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin on Tuesday, where the 32nd Dáil was dissolved. This means the Dáil will not meet tomorrow and the election campaign is underway.Why is there an election on a Saturday? A Saturday polling day is unusual with all elections in recent decades taking place on a Thursday or Friday. However, Ireland’s historic 1918 election was held on a Saturday in December while the Nice Referendum and Children’s Referendum were also held on Saturdays.The Taoiseach said he decided to hold the election on a Saturday to make voting easier for families with children. “I do so knowing the inconvenience to families of a polling day on a weekday during school term – time off work, lost income, increased childcare costs,” he said. “I also want to make it easier for students and those working away from home to cast their votes.”Wait, February 8th sounds familiar. Is something else on that day? Good point. Ireland is playing Wales at the Aviva stadium in rugby’s Six Nations Championship on the 8th while the Dublin-Monaghan national football league is also scheduled to take place in Croke Park.Who is in charge for the next three weeks? Varadkar will remain Taoiseach and Simon Coveney Tánaiste, and all other ministers will stay on until the new Dáil is formed. TDs, however, are no longer TDs.The Green Party has not yet announced an official slogan but party leader Eamon Ryan said the focus is on “thinking forward”. “We’re at the start of a new decade and we have to think forward. What we’ll be saying to people is if you think Ireland should be going green then you should vote Green.”The Labour party had not formally announced a slogan by Tuesday afternoon but Senator Ivana Bacik, director of elections for the party, said the campaign would focus on “real solutions including five non-negotiable proposals on housing, health, work, children and climate”.Sinn Féin tweeted that they would “give workers and families a break, deliver for local communities and stand up for ordinary people”. A vote for Sinn Féin is a vote for “Irish unity”, posted the party.People Before Profit tweeted that people should “vote to break the cycle of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil”, while the Social Democrats tweeted for people to “vote for better, hope for better”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4139762.1579025136!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 dark horses potential surprises","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSaoirse McHugh: she has a big personality, but a victory would still be a big deal.

We did so with the permission of Westminster City Council and the Mayor’s Office. Although we had been let down by the government, and remained stuck in the bloc, a good-natured atmosphere prevailed.Given that background, I had thought it would be a formality to get permission from the same authorities this time around. Yet still nothing has been sanctioned at an official level.There is certainly a demand for it. As a result of the Brexit Party sending just one email, more than 15,000 people have registered their willingness to attend. We hope for positive news from the Mayor’s office. We need it quickly to make this gathering a success. But I am beginning to think the attempts to block this celebration go to the heart of government.The Leave Means Leave rally on 29th March 2019Soon after the Brexit Party chairman, Richard Tice, and I announced we were planning this event, No 10 announced that it would also be marking this moment. Oddly, so far, no tangible arrangements have been confirmed. And, with the exception of Tory MP Mark Francois, those who I had assumed would be most enthusiastic about this bash – such as the ERG faction of Conservative MPs – have been actively putting people off coming to speak. Why would they do this? The answer, apparently, is that Nigel Farage will dominate it. This really is pathetic. They are all welcome to attend, to join in, and to speak. But perhaps the worst of the obstruction we face comes from the House of Commons Commission. This administrative body has claimed it will cost £500,000 for Big Ben, which is undergoing repair, to chime at the appointed hour. Really? It tolled on New Year’s Eve, on Remembrance Sunday and on Armistice Day. Did this cost £500,000 on each occasion? I would love to know the answer.If money really is the problem, crowdfunding plans have already been hatched. Businessmen including Lord Ashcroft have offered to underwrite this effort. Given the amount of public cash-raising schemes launched since 2016 by Remainers in their various bids to derail Brexit, there would be a certain sweetness in our paying en masse for Big Ben to work its magic in any case.The prime minister has said the government is “working up” a strategy to allow people to donate cash to pay for Big Ben to bong. He must go further. Can the Government underwrite it? If they are serious about Brexit and not embarrassed by it, they would make this commitment. Either way, this must move quickly.Come on, Boris. Announce that Big Ben will chime. And then appear on stage in Parliament Square as Prime Minister to mark this extraordinary date.

He was detained for several hours, before Iran’s foreign ministry intervened and arranged for his release.An effigy of the ambassador, who took up the role two years ago, and a Union Jack flag were burned in Tehran.“It is not acceptable for us to see that the British ambassador went outside the embassy and took part in an illegal gathering, filmed it and had a provocative role in its continuation,” Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the spokesman for Iran’s judiciary, told reporters. “This person is persona non grata ... while people’s expectations and international regulations necessitate his expulsion.”Iranian hardliners burn a cutout poster depicting British ambassador to Iran Robert MacaireIran’s general prosecutor urged the government to expel the ambassador.Ayatollah Ahmad Alamolhoda, a prominent hardline cleric, said expelling the ambassador would be the best thing that can happen to him as otherwise loyal supporters of general Qassem Soleimani, killed in a US drone strike earlier this month, would chop him to small pieces.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Minister, said the UK government had received no formal notification that Mr Macaire would be expelled, adding that any such action would be “regrettable”.The UK has attempted to distance itself from the US decision to assassinate Soleimani, widely considered to be the second most important figure in the Islamic Republic. Britain was not given advance notice of the plan.Tehran, however, has kept up the pressure on the UK, which it often refers to as “Little Satan” to the US’s “Big Satan”.The ministry of foreign affairs issued a statement calling on the UK embassy in Tehran to “stop any meddling and provocative measure immediately.“The people of Iran do not accept foreign interference, particularly from governments with a record of colonialism, such as Britain,” it said.The judiciary also announced the arrest of a number of people over the downing of the Ukranian Airlines jet by Iran’s missile defence system, which killed all 176 on board.Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, which lost 63 nationals in the crash, took an extraordinary swipe at Mr Trump, saying the victims would be with their families if not for the US president’s decision to target Soleimani.I think if there were no tensions, if there was no escalation recently in the region, those Canadians would be right now home with their families, Mr Trudeau said.European powers have set us on a new and dangerous phase in Iran\u0026#39s nuclear sagaPost-Brexit Britain will be like Nazi Germany, claims Lib Dem peerUnion boss accused of assault by beating after shouting down megaphone at police officersWatch: What next for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they prepare for life in Canada?Comment: Let\u0026#39s use tax cuts to level up the struggling regions\tLabour peer ordered to undergo \u0026#39behavioural coaching\u0026#39 after he was accused of \u0026#39stalkerish\u0026#39 behaviour Paedophile bishop Peter Ball mentioned friendship with Prince Charles to seem “impregnable”, victim claimsDads cluttering up maternity wards and making women self-conscious about breastfeeding, say midwivesAsian grooming gang free to roam streets because officers were told to \u0026#39find other ethnicities\u0026#39 to investigate, detective claimsPrague mayor shrugs off China anger as he signs twinning agreement with TaipeiPassengers sob as flight violently buffeted by Storm Brendan - and there\u0026#39s more bad weather on the wayLord Byron poem banned from Church of England gravestone Brexit latest news: Commons Speaker warns Big Ben Brexit chimes will cost up to \u0026#39£50,000 a bong\u0026#39Accused French priest claims he \u0026#39didn’t realise the seriousness\u0026#39 of boy scout abuseGovernment considers new law to ban the possession of terrorist propaganda The questions the brief Harry and Meghan statement answers - and those it doesn\u0026#39tWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/01/14/TELEMMGLPICT000220670272_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqOdFb9CYjF5zqGRm4XH9tyWd02aIXpNu2YnLTBIbEGeA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"tuesday evening news briefing meghan markle missed sandringham","story":"The Duchess of Sussex did not dial into the Sandringham summitDuchess of SussexIf you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra’, says Will KirbyOut-and-out epiphanies are rare occurrences, but as I stood with my face deeply embedded in the armpit of a complete stranger in the early hours of the morning for the third time that week, I had the strangest feeling that I was, in fact, done with commuting on the Tube.There were other signs of course – like being kneecapped by the men in suits desperate to get onto the train before anyone has got off, or the passive-aggressive call to ‘move down please!’ at every stop as I consider how I could possibly make all 6ft of myself any smaller to allow for more space, or the unrecognisable smells that could honestly be anything from last night’s takeaway to this morning’s missed shower, or being late because of another series of red signals, or the 37 suitcases I had to negotiate because someone’s decided to move house, or looking at my bank balance and realising these joys are costing me more than £40 a week. I don’t know. But whatever it was, I realised then and there that I needed to find another way to get to work.\u0026nbspSo I did some investigating. A commute can make or break your day so it’s important to get it right. Walking was an option (healthy, free) but would have taken almost two hours each way, which would mean spending more than 12 hours a day either going from, to, or being at the office. I could jog, but, sadly, I hate jogging. The bus is doable, and a cheaper option than the Tube, but would involve three separate buses that aren’t very reliable. Which leaves me with one option. The bike.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSeven things no-one tells you when you start cycling to workInitially I wasn’t sure whether I wanted to join the fluorescent, Lyrca-clad hordes that zoom around the capital at breakneck speeds. I’d never really ridden a road bike before, let alone had an argument with a car or a bus about who’s on whose side of the road. How was I going to fit in if I’d never even owned a pair of mirrored sunglasses and didn’t really know what Strava was?! But it didn’t take long to realise that there are some massive benefits that outweigh any nerves or doubts about taking to the road on two wheels.Firstly, it’s healthy. Even a short cycle at the start and end of the day is exercise you probably wouldn’t otherwise have done, and it makes so much more sense to combine your fitness with your commute rather than trying to carve a slice out of your day to go to the gym. It also makes you feel good – if you take a look around the office first thing in the morning, it’s easy to spot the bright faces who’ve biked into work in amongst those who spent at least part of their morning under the ground.\u0026nbspIt is also better for the environment. Public transport, for its many faults (see above), is certainly greener than driving myself to work every morning, but there’s only so long you can tell yourself it doesn’t have a carbon footprint. Transport for London uses more electricity than anything else in the city, consuming enough power to fuel around 360,000 homes each year. By ditching my Oyster, I can hopefully shed with it that last ounce of green guilt.\u0026nbspWhy I\u0027ve pledged to go flight-free for a yearWhy I\u0027m going vegan for 2020This year I pledge to buy local and eat with the seasonsAnd I may as well do what I can to reduce pollution in the city where I live, even if it is on an inidual scale. A recent study found the capital’s poor air quality leads to around 1,000 hospital admissions for asthma and serious lung conditions every year, and another revealed that around four Londoners are hospitalised every day due to asthma caused by air pollution. Breathing London air is like smoking 160 cigarettes a year, according to the British Heart Foundation, and when you then consider that pollution on the Tube is around 15 times worse than above ground, it’s got to be a good idea to spend as little time down there as you can.\u0026nbspThe combination of a bit of light exercise and avoiding the toxic fumes that swirl around beneath the capital also reduces the chance of a heart attack and other cardiovascular diseases. In fact, if the same number of trips were made by bike as they are in Denmark (26 per cent of all trips that are less than 5km), it could save the NHS a staggering £17 billion within 20 years.So, I’m going to give it a go. At best, I’ll get fit, rediscover a long-lost hobby and do my bit to tackle the growing climate crisis. At worst, I’ll end up with a broken leg and a wardrobe full of Lycra. I’ll keep you posted.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Can Jessica Jones go a whole year without using anything else?In 2020 I will be pledging to become more conscious of the products I purchase and how they are sourced. Like most of us, I am guilty of buying unsustainable products: I use a lot of toiletries and cosmetic products like perfume, makeup and hair serums. I will try to choose products that are made purely from natural ingredients, and ones which have certifications to support their “natural beauty” claims. Using natural ingredients is crucial in preventing toxic chemicals found in beauty and care products, some of them carcinogenic, from seeping into our environment’s ecosystems and into our bodies.The beauty and personal care industry\u0026nbsphas had immense impacts on the environment but recently, with increased awareness of the issues, measures have been taken to combat these. For example, in June 2018, the UK government’s ban on microbeads came into effect and a ban on cotton buds is set to follow in April 2020.\u0026nbsp11 best plastic-free beauty products that aren\u0027t adding to landfillSharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhilst this is a good start, it is not enough. Microbeads are one small part of a much larger issue: the excessive consumerism of beauty and personal care products leading to vast amounts of wastage and toxic pollution. Other damages include plastic packaging with limited recyclability, the carbon footprint of transporting cosmetic goods, harmful toxins in products that are washed down the drain into marine environments, the water wastage in manufacturing processes, and the use of palm oil.\u0026nbspI want to buy from brands that produce sustainably from the offset, in both interior content as well as their packaging. Companies like Wearth sell glass large glass bottles to dispense bulk-bought or homemade shampoo and conditioner and LUSH offer zero-impact packaging products like shampoo bars which claim\u0026nbspto reduce your carbon footprint: one lorry load of shampoo bars delivers the same amount of hair washes as fifteen lorries of liquid shampoo. I will try to ensure that any plastic or material packaging that I do buy is fully recyclable.Created with Sketch.

I have only recently started to consider what is really in the products I buy and how they affect the environment. I am not used to reading ingredient lists, let alone understanding what most of the chemicals actually are. Finding affordable alternatives (on a student budget!) that do not sacrifice sustainability or quality might prove difficult, especially as there are certain products that I use daily that I love. But homemade alternatives to products like body and lip scrubs, are a good way of saving money, whilst also using more simple and natural ingredients.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself. The Queen of Soul gave herself the same space. You can hear her listening to the band, biding her time before firing up her voice to demand R-E-S-P-E-C-T 50 years before the #MeToo movement. Helen Brown340 Master of Puppets (1986), MetallicaDespite not featuring any singles, Metallica’s third album was the UK rock radio breakthrough they’d been looking for. In 1986, they released one of the best metal records of all time, which dealt with the potency and very nature of control, meshing beauty and raw human ugliness together on tracks like “Damage Inc” and “Orion”. This album is about storytelling – the medieval-influenced guitar picks on opener “Battery” should be enough to tell you that. Although that was really the only medieval imagery they conjured up – they ripped Dungeons \u0026amp Dragons clichés out of the lyrics and replaced them with the apocalypse, with bassist Cliff Burton, drummer Lars Ulrich, guitarist Kirk Hammett and singerrhythm guitarist James Hetfield serving as the four horsemen. Roisin O’Connor440 Remain in Light (1980), Talking Heads“Facts are simple and facts are straight  Facts are lazy and facts are late…” sang David Byrne, submerging personal and planetary anxieties about fake news and conspicuous consumption in dense, layers and loops of Afrobeat-indebted funk. Propulsive polyrhythms drive against the lyrical pleas for us to stop and take stock. Same as it ever was. HB540 Catch a Fire (Jamaican version) (1973), Bob Marley and the WailersThe album that carried reggae music to the four corners of the Earth and made Bob Marley an international superstar also set the political tone for many artists to follow. Marley sang of life “where the living is hardest” in “Concrete Jungle” and looked back to Jamaica’s ignoble slaving past – “No chains around my feet but I’m not free”. He packed the album with beautiful melodic numbers, such as “High Tide and Low Tide”, and rhythmic dance tracks like “Kinky Reggae”. Released outside of Jamaica by Island Records with guitar overdubs and ornamentation, the original Jamaican version is a stripped-down masterpiece. CHAn unprecedented 220 hours of studio experimentation saw George Martin and The Beatles looping, speeding, slowing and spooling tapes backwards to create a terrifically trippy new sound. The mournful enigma of McCartney’s “For No One” and the psychedelia of Lennon’s “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “She Said, She Said” can still leave you standing hypnotised over the spinning vinyl, wondering if the music is coming out or being sucked back in. HBIt may be the most “serious” album she’s ever made, yet Like a Prayer is still Madonna at her most accessible – pulling no punches in topics from religion to the dissolution of her marriage. In 1989, Madonna’s personal life was tabloid fodder: a tumultuous marriage to actor Sean Penn finally ended in orce, and she was causing controversy with the “Like a Prayer” video and its burning crosses. On the gospel abandon of the title track, she takes the listener’s breath away with her sheer ambition. Where her past records had been reflections of the modern music that influenced her – Like a Prayer saw her pay homage to bands like Sly \u0026amp the Family Stone, and Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel. The album was also about an artist taking control over her own narrative, after releasing records that asked the audience – and the press – to like her. ROMillennials coming at this album can end up feeling like the guy who saw Hamlet and complained it was all quotations. Jimmy Page’s juggernaut riffs and Robert Plant’s hedonistic wails set the bench mark for all subsequent heavy, hedonistic rock. But it’s worth playing the whole thing to experience the full mystic, monolithic ritual of the thing. Stairway? Undeniable. HB940 The Best of the Shangri-Las (1996), The Shangri-LasOh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no, no one ever did teen heartbreak quite like the Shangri-Las. Long before the Spice Girls packaged attitude for popular consumption, songwriter Ellie Greenwich was having trouble with a group of teenagers who had grown up in a tough part of Queen’s – “with their gestures, and language, and chewing the gum and the stockings ripped up their legs”. But the Shangri-Las sang with an ardour that was so streetwise, passionate and raw that it still reaches across more than half a century without losing any of its power. Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads. CHIt was Andy Warhol who wanted Lou Reed and John Cale to let his beautiful new friend Nico sing with their avant-garde rock band. Truthfully, though, Victor Frankenstein himself couldn’t have sewed together a creature out of more mismatched body parts than this album. It starts with a child’s glockenspiel and ends in deafening feedback, noise, and distortion. Side one track one, “Sunday Morning”, is a wistful ballad fit for a cool European chanteuse sung by a surly Brooklynite. “Venus in Furs” is a jangling, jagged-edge drone about a sex whipping not given lightly. “I’ll Be Your Mirror” is a love song. European Son is rock’n’roll turned sonic shockwave. That’s before you even get on to the song about buying and shooting heroin that David Bowie heard on a test pressing and called “the future of music”. Half a century on, all you have to do is put electricity through The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico to realise that he was right. Chris Harvey240 I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You (1967), Aretha FranklinWhen Jerry Wexler signed the daughter of a violent, philandering preacher to Atlantic records, he took her to church, sat her down at the piano, and let her be herself.

Leader of the Pack (co-written by Greenwich) may be their best-known song, but they were never a novelty act. This compilation captures them at their early Sixties peak. CH1040 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), David BowieFlamboyance, excess, eccentricity – this is the breakthrough album that asserted Bowie as glam rock’s new icon, surpassing T Rex. He may have come to rue his Ziggy Stardust character, but with it, Bowie transcended artists seeking authenticity via more mundane means. It was his most ambitious album – musically and thematically – that, like Prince, saw him unite his greatest strengths from previous works and pull off one of the great rock and roll albums without losing his sense of humour, or the wish to continue entertaining his fans. “I’m out to bloody entertain, not just get up onstage and knock out a few songs,” he declared. “I’m the last person to pretend I’m a radio. I’d rather go out and be a colour television set.” ROIn their brief career, ended by the suicide of 23-year-old singer Ian Curtis, Joy Division created two candidates for the best album by anyone ever. Closer may be a final flowering, but Unknown Pleasures is more tonally consistent, utterly unlike anything before or since. The mood is an all-pervading ink-black darkness, but there is a spiritual force coming out of the grooves that is so far beyond pop or rock, it feels almost Dostoevskyan. There are classic songs – Disorder, She’s Lost Control and New Dawn Fades – and for those who’d swap every note Eric Clapton ever played for one of Peter Hook’s basslines, the sequence at 4:20 on I Remember Nothing is perhaps the single most thrilling moment in the entire Joy Division catalogue. CHThough her 1971 album, Blue, is usually chosen for these kinds of lists, Mitchell surpassed its silvery, heartbroken folk five years later with a record that found her confidently questioning its culturally conditioned expectations of womanhood. Against an ambiguous, jazzy landscape, her deepening, difficult voice weighs romance and domesticity against the adventure of “strange pillows” and solitude. HBThe answer to whether Robyn could follow up the brilliance of her self-titled 2005 album came in a burst of releases in 2010, the EPs Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt3, and this 15-track effort, essentially a compilation album. It includes different versions of some tracks, such as the non-acoustic version of “Hang With Me” (and we can argue all night about that one), but leaves well alone when it comes to the single greatest electronic dance track since “I Feel Love”, “Dancing On My Own”. Body Talk is simply jammed with great songs. CH “I will study and look back on the whole world of entertainment and perfect it,” wrote Jackson as he turned 21 and shook off his cute, controlled child-star imagery to release his jubilant, fourth solo album. Produced by Quincy Jones, the sophisticated disco funk nails the balance between tight, tendon-twanging grooves and liberated euphoria. Glitter ball magic. HBHow good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music – not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densely-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.” ROThis is the album that changes everything. The synthesised sounds coming out of Kraftwerk’s Kling-Klang studios had already become pure and beautiful on 1975’s Radio-Activity, but on Trans-Europe Express, their sophistication subtly shifts all future possibilities. The familiar quality of human sweetness and melancholy in Ralf Hutter’s voice is subsumed into the machine as rhythms interlock and bloom in side two’s mini-symphony that begins with the title track. Released four months before Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love, Trans-Europe Express influenced everything from hip-hop to techno. All electronic dance music starts here. CH1740 Kind of Blue (1959), Miles DavisWith the sketches of melody only written down hours before recording, the world’s best-selling jazz record still feels spontaneous and unpredictable. Davis’s friend George Russell once explained that the secret of its tonal jazz was to use every note in a scale “without having to meet the deadline of a particular chord”. Kind of Blue is unrepeatably cool. HB“If I ventured in the slipstream, between the viaducts of your dream…” To enter this musical cathedral, where folk, jazz and blue-eyed soul meet is always to feel a sense of awe. Recorded in just two eight-hour sessions, in which Morrison first played the songs to the assembled musicians then told them to do their own thing, Astral Weeks still feels as if it was made yesterday. Morrison’s stream-of-consciousness lyrics within the richness of the acoustic setting – double bass, classical guitar and flute – make this as emotionally affecting an album as any in rock and pop. CH“Life is all right in America  If you\u0027re all white in America” yelp the immigrants in this passionate and political musical relocating of Romeo and Juliet to Fifites New York. Leonard Bernstein’s sophisticated score is a melting pot of pop, classical and Latin music Stephen Sondheim’s lyrics sharp as a flick knife. An unanswered prayer for a united and forgiving USA. HB2040 Sign o\u0027 the Times (1987), PrinceSign o’ the Times is Prince’s magnum opus from a catalogue of masterworks – a double album ning funk, rock, R\u0026ampB and most essentially, soul. It is the greatest articulation of his alchemic experiments with musical fusion – the sum of several projects Prince was working on during his most creatively fruitful year. On Sign o’ the Times, the bass is king – Prince cemented his guitar god status on Purple Rain. There are tracks that drip with sex, and love songs like “Adore”, which remains one of the greatest of all time. Stitched together with the utmost care, as if he were writing a play with a beginning, a middle and an end, the album is a landmark in both pop and in art. ROCaught in the psychological undertow of family trauma and all those commercial surf songs, 23-year-old Brian Wilson had a panic attack and retreated to the studio to write this dreamlike series of songs whose structural tides washed them way beyond the preppy formulas of drugstore jukeboxes. Notes pinged from vibraphones and coke cans gleam in the strange, sad waves of bittersweet melody. HBWeave a circle round her thrice… Joanna Newsom is dismissed by some as kookily faux-naif, but her second album, before she trained out the childlike quality from her voice, may be the most enchanted record ever made. At times, she sounds other-worldly, sitting at her harp, singing to herself of sassafras and Sisyphus, but then a phrase will carry you off suddenly to the heart’s depths – “Still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water”. Ys’s pleasures are not simple or immediate. Newsom’s unusual song structures, with their fragmented melodies, and strange and beautiful orchestral arrangements by 63-year-old Van Dyke Parks, take time to work their magic. But once you’re bewitched, Ys’s spell never wears off. CH2340 It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), Public EnemyPublic Enemy’s second album is hip-hop’s game-changing moment, where a new musical form that arrived fully born after years of development away from meddling outsiders found its radical voice. It Takes a Nation of Millions… is still one of the most powerful, provocative albums ever made, “Here is a land that never gave a damn  About a brother like me,” raps Chuck D on “Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos”. Producer Hank Shocklee creates a hard-edged sound from samples that pay homage to soul greats such as James Brown and Isaac Hayes, and Flavor Flav gives it an unmistakeable zest. CH2440 Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Pink FloydIt’s easy to knock these white, male, middle-class proggers, with their spaceship full of technology and their monolithic ambitions. But the walloping drums, operatic howls and “quiet desperation” of this concept album about the various forms of madness still resonates with the unbalanced, overwhelmed and alienated parts of us all. Play loud, alone and after dark. HB2540 The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998), Lauryn HillLauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with this immense and groundbreaking work. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around. ROThe great French singer-songwriter provocateur probably wouldn’t get too many takers today for a concept album about a tender love between his middle-aged self and a teenage girl he knocks off her bicycle in his Rolls-Royce. But, musically, this cult album is sublime, an extraordinary collision of funk bass, spoken-word lyrics and Jean-Claude Vannier’s heavenly string arrangements. “Ballade de Melody Nelson”, sung by Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, is one of his most sublimely gorgeous songs. CHThere’s nothing contrived about Karen Dalton’s ability to flip out the guts of familiar songs and give them a dry, cracked folk-blues twist. Expanding the emotional and narrative boundaries of songs like Percy Sledge’s When a Man Loves a Woman is just what she did. Why has it taken the world so long to appreciate her? HB“Goddamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England.” PJ Harvey may have sounded like she was channelling Boris and Nige when she made this striking album in 2015, but few Brexiteers would want to take this journey with her. Let England Shake digs deep into the soil of the land, where buried plowshares lie waiting to be beaten into swords. Death is everywhere, sometimes in its most visceral form: “I’ve seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat,” she sings on “The Words That Maketh Murder”, “Arms and legs are in the trees.” Musically, though, it’s ravishing: Harvey employs autoharp, zither, rhodes piano, xylophone and trombone to create a futuristic folk sound that’s strikingly original yet could almost be from an earlier century. CH2940 Boy in da Corner (2003), Dizzee RascalIt’s staggering to listen back to this album and remember Dizzee was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk. RO3040 Hounds of Love (1985), Kate BushProof that a woman could satisfy her unique artistic vision and top the charts without kowtowing to industry expectations, Kate Bush’s self-produced masterpiece explored the extreme range of her oceanic emotions from the seclusion of a cutting-edge studio built in the garden of her 17th-century farmhouse. The human vulnerability of her voice and traditional instruments are given an electrical charge by her pioneering use of synthesisers. Thrilling and immersive. HBA uniquely British take on hip hop and soul that continues to influence booming modern genres like grime and dubstep, the Bristol collective’s debut gave a cool new pulse to the nation’s grit and grey. You can smell ashtrays on greasy spoon tables in Tricky’s whisper and feel the rain on your face in Shara Nelson’s exhilarating improvisations. HBIt only takes 20 seconds of opening track Bone Machine to realise Pixies and producer Steve Albini have stripped down the sound of rock ’n’ roll and rebuilt it piece by piece. The angry smack of Led Zep drums, ripe bass, and sheet metal guitar straight off the Stooges’ Detroit production line are separated and recombined. Pixies’ sound is already complete before Black Francis embarks on one of his elusive pop cult narratives (“your bone’s got a little machine”). The tension between the savagery of his vocals and Kim Deal’s softer melodic tone won’t reach its perfect balance until their next album but their debut, Surfer Rosa is gigantic, and deserving of big, big love. Its “loud, quiet, loud” tectonics would prove so influential that Nirvana’s Kurt Cobain would later say he “was basically trying to rip off the Pixies”. CH3340 Talking Timbuktu (1994), Ali Farka Toure and Ry Cooder If you ever doubt the possibility of relaxed and respectful conversation across the world’s cultural isions, then give yourself an hour with this astonishing collaboration between Mali’s Ali Farka Toure (who wrote all but one of the tracks) and California’s Ry Cooder (whose slide guitar travels through them like a pilgrim). Desert meets Delta Blues. HBCompared to the blues, the incalculable influence of gospel music on pop, soul and rock ’n’ roll has been underplayed. It can be found in every song on this brilliant 27-track compilation. If you can’t hear James Brown in the foot-stomping opener “Move on Up a Little Higher” by Brother Joe May, you’re not listening hard enough. The road to Motown from “Lord, Lord, Lord” by Professor Alex Bradford is narrow indeed, but you could still take a side-turning and follow his ecstatic whoops straight to Little Richard, who borrowed them, and on to the Beatles who copied them from him. The swooping chord changes in James Cleveland’s “My Soul Looks Back” are magnificent. All the irreplaceable soul voices, from Aretha Franklin to Bobby Womack, were steeped in gospel. This is a great place to hear where they came from. Companion album The Great Gospel Women is a marvel, too. CH“A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,” said this angel-voiced, transgender artist in 2012. Four years later, the seismic drums and radical ecofeminist agenda of Hopelessness shook that club’s crumbling foundations to dust. The horrors of drone warfare, paedophilia and global warming are held up to the bright lights in disconcertingly beautiful rage. HBKurt Cobain had one goal with In Utero: to pull Nirvana away from what he dubbed the “candy-ass” sound on Nevermind – the album that had turned them into one of the biggest rock bands on the planet – and take them back to punk-rock. He asked Pixies’ producer Steve Albini to oversee production.  It didn’t exactly eschew commercial success upon release (it went on to sell 15m copies worldwide), but the heaviness the band felt as they recorded it bears down on the listener from the opening track. Disheartened by the media obsession with his personal life and the fans clamouring for the same old shit, In Utero is pure, undiluted rage. “GO AWAYYYYYYYYYYY” he screams on “Scentless Apprentice”, capturing the essence of Patrick Suskind’s novel Perfume: Story of a Murderer and using it as a metaphor for his disgust at the music industry, and the press. ROCurtis Mayfield had been spinning golden soul music from doo-wop roots with The Impressions for more than a decade before releasing his first solo album, which contains some of his greatest songs. While some point to the 1972 Blaxploitation soundtrack Superfly as the definitive Mayfield album, Curtis is deeper and more joyous, its complex arrangements masterly. Mayfield’s sweet falsetto sings of Nixon’s bland reassurances over the fuzz-bass of “(Don’t Worry) If There Is a Hell Below We’re All Going to Go” doleful horns give the politically conscious “We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue” a profound emotional undertow “Move On Up” is simply one of the most exhilarating songs in pop. To spend time with Curtis is to be in the presence of a beautiful soul. CHBefore they went their own way, Fleetwood Mac decided to tell a story that would be the quintessential marker for American rock culture in the Seventies. As Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks tossed the charred remains of their relationship at one another on “Dreams” and “Go Your Own Way”, the rest of the band conjured up the warm West Coast harmonies, the laid back California vibes of the rhythm section and the clear highs on “Gold Dust Woman”, in such a way that Rumours would become the definitive sound of the era. At the time of its release, it was the fastest-selling LP of all time its success turned Fleetwood Mac into a cultural phenomenon. ROA virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Hendrix used Are You Experienced? to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced? the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”. And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his. RODisco’s crowning glory is this album that Chic’s Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards made with Kathy Sledge and her sisters Debbie, Joni and Kim. Nile and ’Nard were at the peak of their powers, classic songs were pouring out of them – We Are Family was released in the same year as the epochal “Good Times” by Chic – and this album has four of them, “Lost in Music”, “He’s the Greatest Dancer”, “Thinking of You” and the title track itself. Sister Sledge gave Rodgers a chance to work with warmer, gutsier vocals than the cool voices he used to give Chic records such laid-back style and the result is a floor-filling dance party, punctuated by mellow ballads.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile, making it difficult to attribute specific events or reasons to market movements.But the volatility, combined with a lack of mainstream applications, means bitcoin is consistently referred to as digital gold because it is more commonly used\u0026nbspas a store of value than a currency.Bitcoin is digital gold, explained\u0026nbspBrooke Stoddard, an investor and former Goldman Sachs associate. Bitcoin and gold are borderless, decentralised, and verifiable. Both are worth something, they store value. But bitcoin is easier to transfer, ide, and harder to counterfeit.Bitcoin\u0027s price is therefore often compared with that of gold, though research suggests the two are not linked.Bitcoin has risen by more than 20 per cent since the start of 2020, however it fell by nearly a third between October and November last year during a time of similar uncertainty when the Trump administration was ramping up sanctions on China and the UK\u0027s future in the UK was unclear.Why bitcoin\u0027s bumpy revolution is only just beginningCryptocurrency trader and author Glen Goodman rejected any relation between bitcoin\u0027s price and the US assassination of\u0026nbspSoleimani, or the subsequent Iranian missile strikes on US military bases in Iraq.Bitcoin was already in a strong uptrend before the missiles hit, Mr Goodman wrote on Twitter following the attacks.\u0026nbspGold rose and stocks fell initially, but traders soon relaxed, so stocks recovered and gold fell.

It does affect a lot of boys of colour more than other races.\u0026nbsp“They tend to have longer hair. It is more of a cultural thing.”One school\u0026nbspMs Miller is hoping to apply to says boys’ hair should not\u0026nbspbe “too long”, but girls are allowed long hair if it is tied back. “That comes under the umbrella of sexism,” she said.Schools unfairly punish black students for hair and ‘kissing teeth\u0027“Why can you say a boy has to have short hair and a girl is allowed to have long hair? It is prejudice,” she told The Independent.\u0026nbspMs Miller added: “It is the same as girls having to wear skirts. Why should they have to wear skirts to school? I think the rules should be the same across the board for boys and girls.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Such burst gravitational ways could be an important way of doing so – but are yet to be found, and scientists don\u0027t know exactly what they will look like.Star is acting strangely and may be about to explode, astronomers sayLIGO describes them as the gravitational waves that go bump in the night, and scientists admit there is little understanding of where they may come from. While astrophysicists have long predicted they may happen, there is too little information about the parts of the universe that would spawn them to say when they might arrive or how they will appear when they do.Searching for burst gravitational waves requires being utterly open-minded, the LIGO website reads. For these kinds of gravitational waves, scientists must\u0026nbsprecognize\u0026nbspa pattern of signals even when such a pattern has not been predicted or\u0026nbspmodeled\u0026nbsp(what we think a signal may look like) before. If you don’t know what you’re looking for, it’s really hard to find it.While this makes searching for burst gravitational waves difficult, detecting them has the greatest potential to reveal revolutionary information about the Universe.Some have speculated that the wave could have come from Betelgeuse, a nearby star that is behaving oddly and could be about to explode into a supernova. But that star still appears to be in place, and the wave does not seem to have come from the correct part of the sky.Michael Merrifield,\u0026nbspprofessor of astronomy at the University of Nottingham, described the event as weird on Twitter, and suggested that further observation should give more detail on where it had come from.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the end, Jess went for Mike (poor Leanne) while Eve opted for Callum, leaving Shaughna apoplectic with rage.And there\u0027s yet more drama... ahead of tonight\u0027s episode, it has been revealed that Ollie\u0026nbspdramatically quit the show. The estate owner, who has been at the centre of controversy after photos showed him posing with the carcasses of dead animals that were killed in Africa, said he left\u0026nbspbecause he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis is interesting given that, in a preview of tonight\u0027s episode, he seems\u0026nbspto be quite happily\u0026nbspyo-yo-ing between Paige\u0026nbspand Siannise.To follow the events of the episode, keep up with the live blog below...Ollie\u0027s statement on leaving the villa...\u0026nbspI have to be honest with myself, and everyone, that I do still love someone else. I\u0026nbsphave to follow my heart in this scenario and it would be wrong for me to ignore these feelings. At the end of the day, this is Love Island and it’s about finding love. If I carried on anything with Paige, or any other girl that might come into the villa, it wouldn’t be fair on them.\u0026nbspHere are the biggest talking points from last night\u0027s episode to refresh your memory...\u0026nbsp1: Love Island is in a bit of a rut \u0026nbspBanter, a kiss-and-tell game show, and a big choice at the end of the hour. Such is the formula to which Love Island has rigorously adhered across previous seasons and here we go again in South Africa. The problem is that, as yet, the series has yet to cough up a break-out personality to make us ignore how predictable it all is. Mike, the likeliest of lads, is the closest to a star so far. But even he is essentially thoughtful and sensible. Good for him – not great for ITV ratings you suspect.\u0026nbsp2: Do half the contestants even want to be on Love Island? \u0026nbspLeanne woke from her trance long enough to snog Mike during the tea-based kiss-and-tell competition (yes that is a thing). Otherwise she seemed perfectly happy in the background. Ditto Sophie, Paige, Cheatin’ Ollie, Connor of the wonder-teeth…. All are clearly appreciative of the free winter break in South Africa. But none is visibly burning up with desire to win Love Island.\u0026nbsp3: Will Jess and Eve turn on one another? \u0026nbspFlickers of tension broke out between the twins as they weighed up which of the boys they wanted to pick (both fancied Mike). Obviously nobody in the real world would want to see sisters falling out. But unless a wedge of some sort is driven through their alliance it’s hard to see where the contrived conflict that is the lifeblood of reality TV will come from. Shaughna looks properly annoyed with Callum – but he had no say in whether or not he was chosen so a split there hardly yields oodles of dramatic potential. Winter Love Island is in danger of freezing over slightly.Welcome to tonight\u0027s Love Island blog.

Guðnadóttir recently picked up a Golden Globe, Critics’ Choice Award, Emmy, and a Society of Composers \u0026amp Lyricist award for her work on Joker and the acclaimed HBO series Chernobyl.In an interview with Deadline, the composer mused on the impact of her nomination:\u0026nbsp“I think it’s magnificent to be able to be a part of this conversation, and to shed some light on the situation of women in the industry, especially in this category, because it’s a little bit silly how few there are.”\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesCreated with Sketch.

It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film. Dirty Dancing 2 didn’t really deserve such a soundtrack, but it adds some actual heat to a film that, asides from the superb dance routines, leaves you cold.Martin Scorsese had strict rules for the soundtrack to his film Goodfellas: each song had to have been around during the time in which the scene was set, and the tracks had to make some kind of comment on the scene or character in question “in an oblique way”. A staggering 48 songs are heard during the film, including classics by Dean Martin, Fred Astaire and The Drifters, Sid Vicious, The Who and The Rolling Stones. One of the most unforgettable moments is when Bobby Darin’s “Beyond the Sea” plays as the Wise Guys cook dinner, which was “always a big thing” in prison.When it comes to soundtracking your movie, it helps if the director is a massive music nerd. Of course, music was always going to play a huge part in a film about a boy in a band and his video game quest to win the girl of his dreams. But Edgar Wright, a former music video director, found a way to seamlessly integrate his soundtrack into Scott Pilgrim vs the World’s narrative. Beck, who wrote the music for Scott Pilgrim’s garage band Sex Bob-omb, was a perfect match for their chaotic, DIY approach, while Metric’s song “Black Sheep” was used for a performance by ex-girlfriend Envy Adams’s (Brie Larson) band The Clash at Demonhead.Drive wouldn’t have worked as well as it did without the soundtrack. Steven Soderbergh\u0027s go-to composer Cliff Martinez assembled the songs for Nicolas Winding Refn’s ambitious indie project, showing an understanding that the most effective soundtracks are often the ones that transport you into the movie without you realising. By using a set of mostly female vocalists, all of whom sing over dry electronic beats, Martinez achieved a sonic portrayal of Drive’s startling juxtaposition between beauty and violence.It’s the biggest movie soundtrack of all time and the 15th best-selling album in the US. Whitney Houston breathed new life into songs by Dolly Parton (“I Will Always Love You”) and Chaka Khan (“I’m Every Woman”). Five of the songs performed by Houston were hits: I Will Always Love You, I\u0027m Every Woman, I Have Nothing, Run to You (both Oscar-nominated), and Queen of the NightYes, it was the Fab Four\u0027s worst film, but the soundtrack is packed with some of their best songs: “I am the Walrus”, She Loves You and “Hello, Goodbye”. Where A Hard Day’s Night, Yellow Submarine and Help were undoubtedly more influential on popular culture, Magical Mystery Tour is the most fun to listen to – regardless of how much effort is required to watch.Few films offer as comprehensive a look at hip-hop stars during the heights of their creative powers – even though the movie itself was a clumsily written crime drama. Belly’s soundtrack captured the East Coast rap scene as it stepped towards a grittier sound and underwent one of the most important transitions for any genre in music history – with contributions from the likes of D’Angelo, members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas and Jay-Z.At the time, it felt like Richard Kelly’s dark and gloomy film starring a young Jake Gyllenhaal was one of the few to truly capture what it meant to be a confused, alienated teenager. With composer Michael Andrews, Kelly picked some the best songs from an era that dealt in existential angst via upbeat synth-pop: Echo and the Bunnymen, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, The Pet Shop Boys and more. By choosing to close the film on Michael Andrews’ cover of Tears for Fears’ “Mad World”, Kelly underpins both the self-absorbed attitude of teenagers convinced that only the artists singing these songs truly understood them, and the nostalgia felt by their parents who were there in the moment.Midnight Cowboy – the first X-rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture – took original material and pre-existing songs to complement the theme of a naïve cowboywannabe sex worker trying to survive in a big city, and the juxtaposition between Jon Voight’s character Joe Buck and dying con artist “Ratso” (Dustin Hoffman). Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti. In between, you have Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails and, of course, This Mortal Coil’s “Song to the Siren” – a track that caught Lynch’s attention and inspired him to co-write two albums for Twin Peaks chanteuse Julee Cruise.1240 29. The Last Days of Disco (1998)Whit Stillman’s 1998 indie-classic starred then-virtual unknowns Kate Beckinsale and Chloë Sevigny as friends and roommates in early-Eighties New York. Add that to a wall-to-wall disco soundtrack and you’ve got an intoxicating film, set 20 years after the genre’s heyday, with classic dancefloor anthems from Chic, Diana Ross, and Sister Sledge belted out one after the other.  In the summer of 1992, the soundtrack to a film that flopped at the box office offered the masses the gateway they needed into the Seattle grunge scene. Cameron Crowe wanted the Singles soundtrack to be “more like a simple mixtape of Seattle’s finest”, and ended up with a veritable who’s-who of every important band from that moment in music history: Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden and Mudhoney… everyone apart from Nirvana. Regardless, almost three decades after the film’s release, the soundtrack serves as a landmark for one of the most pivotal moments in music history.Adapting literary classics to modern-day high-school scenarios was the big thing in the Nineties. Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Before Garden State and 500 Days of Summer, the team behind the adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel compiled 15 tracks like a mixtape. It was one its lead character would have approved of: as with many of the soundtracks on this list, High Fidelity’s success lies in a balance between old-school gems by the Velvet Underground, The Kinks and Elvis Costello to Noughties newcomers like Stereolab and Royal Trux.This may seem like sacrilege given that the first Dirty Dancing soundtrack is indisputably the more iconic of the two. And yes, the sequel (essentially a remake set in Cuba during the 1950s), starring Romola Garai and future Rogue One star Diego Luna, suffered from a plot loaded with clichés and lack of chemistry between its two lead actors. But the soundtrack – featuring the Grammy-nominated Latin fusion band Yerba Buena, Colombian rock band Aterciopelados, and the Cuban hip hop group Orishasis – is what draws me back to this guilty pleasure of a film.

Fred Neil\u0027s song “Everybody\u0027s Talkin\u0027”, which underscores the first act, won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance, Male (for Harry Nilsson).Trent Reznor’s work on David Lynch’s 1997 neo-noir movie is loaded with stark electronics and instrumentals by Angelo Badalamenti.

Cruel Intentions came from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s 18th-century work, Les Liaisons Dangereuses, and starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe as Kathryn and Sebastian: two spoilt, bored rich kids toying with the naïve and virtuous Annette (Reese Witherspoon). John Ottman was originally enlisted to compose the score, but producers decided that wouldn’t sit well with the teenage demographic it was going for and instead plumped for a soundtrack of Placebo, Blur, Skunk Anansie, Aimee Mann and Counting Crows. This mix of credible and corny mirrors a typical experience we go through as adolescents, discovering iniduality via the music we listen to and trying to leave the theatrics behind. The cult status of both the featured music and the film itself suggests we can never let the drama go completely.Flashdance, the first collaboration between producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, is important because it actually changed how some of the most popular films of the Eighties were shot. For each song featured in the film there is a scene presented in the same way as a music video, like the use of “Maniac” as Alex (Jennifer Beals) trains for her dance audition, or the lead song of the film “What a Feeling”, which plays during the opening montage of the steel mill. The latter, written by Italian composer Giorgio Moroder, Keith Forsey and Irene Cara (who performed the track), became the singer’s first and only number one hit. It also won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, a Golden Globe, and a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Michael Sembello’s “Maniac”, meanwhile, went on to become one of the highest-grossing songs ever written for a film.While Half Nelson isn’t as highly regarded as Lars and the Real Girl or Drive,  it’s the one that helped Ryan Gosling break away from his status as the heartthrob from The Notebook. It also has a phenomenal soundtrack steered by Broken Social Scene, whose brilliant collection of B-sides proved indispensable for this film about a drug-addicted middle-school teacher struggling to deal with the aftermath of a breakup. In between those tracks you’ve got gritty hip hop that shows Dan\u0027s crossover into the world of his pupil, the stoic Drey (Shareeka Epps) – from New York collective Dujeous, to Rhymefest.1740 24. Lost in Translation (2003)Sofia Coppola has a history of needle drops that encapsulate certain moods that can’t be expressed through dialogue, particularly if it involves a medley of shoegaze from Air and My Bloody Valentine, and the full-throttle debauchery of Peaches on “Fuck the Pain Away”. The soundtrack was so influential that several critics suggested it had something to do with the rebirth of shoegaze in the mid-Noughties. Either way, there a few better songs to close a film than Jesus and Mary Chain’s “Just Like Honey”, that plays just after the kiss goodbye between Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) and that indecipherable whisper.Former Massive Attack producer Nellee Hooper is the brainchild behind one of the greatest film soundtracks of all time. Working with composers Craig Armstrong and Marius de Vries, he beta-tested many of the tracks that ended up on the album by playing them at 5am to afterparty guests at his house in London. Others took direct inspiration from Shakespeare’s original text, with Justin Warfield of One Inch Punch and Art Alexakis of Everclear both allowed to watch early edits of scenes from the film to inspire them. Like the soundtracks for Kill Bill, Trainspotting and Marie Antoinette, it’s the vast eclecticism of the songs featured in Romeo + Juliet that make you remember each one, and the scene where each is used, for years after first seeing the film.As well as making a star of reggae singer Jimmy Cliff, both the film and soundtrack for The Harder They Come exposed mainstream audiences to the emerging Kingston recording industry, helping bring the genre to the US and beyond. Only the title track was an original recorded by Cliff for the movie the rest were singles released in Jamaica between 1967 and 1972, including Cliff’s superb “You Can Get it if You Really Want”, plus songs from seminal artists like Toots and the Maytals and Desmond Dekker.A veritable masterpiece: The Beach soundtrack is what gives this film starring a fresh-faced Leonardo DiCaprio its vitality, capturing the essence of the trance music heard during Thai beach parties during the Nineties. It was supervised by Pete Tong, who said the songs, including Moby’s “Porcelain” and Dario G’s “Voices”, are what make the film “watchable time and time again”. The way the music progresses mirrors the grit and darkness that begin to emerge out of paradise.2140 20. Pretty in Pink (1986)John Hughes virtually pioneered the formula for teen movies soundtracked by angsty British post-punk rock. Echo \u0026amp the Bunnymen, The Smiths, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and New Order all appeared on what is essentially Hughes’s checklist of what cool kids were – or should have been – listening to in the Eighties.    Curated and co-executive produced by Kendrick Lamar, the Black Panther soundtrack brought on a select group of extraordinary talent that would understand the themes in the film, from Anderson .Paak to Earl Sweatshirt. Leading this group is Lamar himself, undoubtedly the best choice of artist for a film that explores responsibility, black power, family dynamics and loyalty. Where Jay-Z failed to step aside on the Great Gatsby soundtrack and let other artists do their thing, Lamar is more interested in highlighting the skills of his fellow artists, like South African singer Babes Wodumo, or Jorja Smith. It’s true that the Black Panther album pales in comparison to some of Lamar’s solo work, but it’s rare to see a soundtrack that so deeply considers the subject matter it has been presented with, and the responsibility of continuing the story through music.2340 18. Dazed and Confused (1993)Dazed and Confused was relatable even if you didn’t happen to spend your teenage years riding shotgun in a 1975 Chevy El Camino. This is largely due to director Richard Linklater highlighting an era of raucous butt-rock anthems and stoner jams, from Alice Cooper’s “School’s Out” to Ted Nugent’s “Stranglehold”.In a year that was saturated with serious historical and period dramas, from a remake of Jane Eyre to The Queen, Marie Antoinette stood out for its highly stylised and fun approach to a well-known figure. Director Sofia Coppola took a similar approach with the music as James Gunn did for s of the Galaxy, mixing new wave and post-punk – including The Strokes, New Order, Adam and the Ants and The Cure – with period music by Baroque composers Vivaldi and Couperin. By doing so, Coppola gave her audience something to relate to, and a soundtrack that suited Marie Antoinette’s rebellious teenage spirit. The best example of this is in the shopping scene – set to the song “I Want Candy” by Bow Wow Wow – that famously included a pair of purple Converse: one of the most defining fashion items of Nineties teen culture. It is a brilliant yet subtle alignment of modern Western consumerism and the outrageous decadence at Versailles during the 18th century.One of the most eclectic compilations to grace cinema-goers’ ears in recent years: the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack wins for those three songs by Sufjan Stevens alone. The American singer-songwriter remixed his 2010 track “Futile Devices” and also wrote two new songs specifically for the film: “Visions of Gideon” and “Mystery of Love”, the latter of which was nominated for the Best Original Song Oscar. Director Luca Guadagnino worked with film editor Walter Fasano and music supervisor Robin Urdang, all understanding that music would play a “vital role”. He wanted the music to give the film a “precise identity” that would act as a “voice” in the movie, he told Billboard. “That’s when I thought of Sufjan Stevens.” Other tracks, like the buoyant “Love My Way” by The Psychedelic Furs, captured the wistful, heady nature of hot, endless summers in Italy during the Eighties.Of course, any biopic about the rise and fall of gangsta rap collective NWA had to have a killer soundtrack – especially if its former members were involved in its production. Even so, the meticulous care with which the soundtrack for Straight Outta Compton was assembled is impressive, and provides backdrop for an origin story about some of the most influential and important records – and artists – of the Eighties and Nineties.2740 14. 500 Days of Summer (2009)This offbeat romantic comedy has developed cult status over the years and stood out at the time for its original take on the “boy meets girl” genre. Music is what first drew characters Summer (Zoe Deschanel) and Tom (Joseph Gordon Levitt) together (they start talking after Summer overhears The Smiths playing on Tom’s MP3 player). Each song mirrors the various highs and lows the characters go through, helped by director Marc Webb’s background making music videos for indie pop artists. Regina Spektor’s song “Hero” is the perfect backdrop for the scene where Tom realises his hopes of getting back with Summer are futile the track closes on the lyric “no one’s got it all”, as if to point out that not everyone gets the fairytale ending they hope for.A veritable smorgasbord for any self-respecting music nerd: Baby Driver took movie soundtracks to a whole other plane. The Fault in Our Stars actor Ansel Elgort stars as “Baby”, a skilled getaway driver who relies on a steady stream of music in order to counteract the effects of tinnitus.There are vintage cuts from The Beach Boys, Beck and Barry White, and Seventies rock gems by Queen and Golden Earring. Yet it was the slightly more unassuming song “Bellbottoms” from the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion album Orange that initially inspired the film. A then 21-year-old Edgar Wright was sitting in his bedroom, “completely broke”, when he began to visualise a car chase set to the songs on that album.George Lucas managed to amplify the already-nostalgic mood on his “summer of ‘62” film by choosing songs from the mid-to-late Fifties as the lead tracks on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Songs from Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry to The Beach Boys are all presented by legendary disc jockey Wolfman Jack.3040 11. 10 Things I Hate About YouIf Pretty in Pink captured teenage angst in the Eighties, 10 Things I Hate About You achieved it for the decade that followed. Unlike many films of the Nineties, which attempted to capitalise on the major rock stars of the day, 10 Things managed to select what is essentially a list of one-hit wonders, from Letters to Cleo and Semisonic to Save Ferris. When you watch the film today, it only serves to fuel that feeling of nostalgia and add to its ever-growing cult status.3140 10. Do the Right Thing (1989)Spike Lee’s Brooklyn-based masterpiece is set to a breathtaking jazz score conducted and composed by his father, Bill Lee. It’s also punctuated by summer jams and blissful ballads, or the urgent demands of Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power”, which is played from Radio Raheem’s boombox a number of times through the film.Until Eden, there was no film about club culture that took the scene seriously. French filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love’s character Paul (Felix de Givry) is based on the experiences of her brother Sven – a relatively popular DJ who had to look on as his peers, including Daft Punk, achieved global fame by pioneering the early EDM scene. Its soundtrack offers a comprehensive look at the house, jungle and garage music that was the lifeblood of Paris youth culture in the Nineties, but is also carefully chosen to match the situation of the film’s characters. Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” signals a mood-change at a celebratory dinner, while “Happy Song” by Charles Dockins conveys Paul’s euphoria as his hero Tony Humphries works the decks in a New York club.  This was one of the first films to be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.This was one of the first films to also be defined by its music Mike Nichols also helped pioneer the practice of curating pre-existing songs that would appeal to a pop radio audience. Simon \u0026amp Garfunkel’s music was the perfect fit when it came to music that would show Dustin Hoffman’s character’s intensifying feelings of isolation, particular whenever “The Sounds of Silence” was used.Curtis Mayfield’s third studio album was released as the soundtrack to the Blaxploitation film of the same name. It was groundbreaking for its themes of poverty and drug abuse which made the record stand out among the less socially aware music of its time. It would go on to influence everyone from TV score composers to soul singers in the decades that followed.3540 6. s of the Galaxy (2014)The soundtrack for Danny Boyle’s adaptation of Irvine Welsh’s novel was so popular it promoted a release of a second soundtrack a year later, in 1997. After two decades, it still holds up as one of the greatest and most lovingly curated collections of songs in music history. The use of “Lust for Life” in the opening scene triggered something of a career renaissance for Iggy Pop (one that many would argue didn’t do him many favours). There’s a romanticised overdose set to Lou Reed’s “Perfect Day”, and Heaven 17 soundtrack a club scene with “Temptation”. A particularly disgusting toilet scene is set to Brian Eno’s “Deep Blue Day” and French composer Georges Bizet’s “Carmen Suite No.2”.Quentin Tarantino didn’t commission a traditional film score for what is arguably his most adored film, 1994’s Pulp Fiction. Instead, he mixed American surf music and classic rock and roll, including the late Dick Dale’s “Misirlou” in the iconic opening scene. The track was suggested to Tarantino by musician Boyd Rice, via their mutual friend Allison Anders. The soundtrack had such an impact – reaching number 21 on the Billboard 200 and selling more than two million units by 1996 – that it was credited with “reinvigorating” surf rock and sparking a trend by advertisers to use it in their commercials, “to help sell everything from burritos to toothpaste”. Chuck Berry’s song “You Never Can Tell”, also known as “C’est la Vie”, also enjoyed a resurgence in popularity thanks to its use in the famous dance scene with Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta). Neither Cameron Crowe nor his music coordinator Danny Bramson wanted to pander to the charts for this story based on the director’s years as a teenage rock journalist. If anything, they avoided tracks that seemed like potential radio favourites, choosing lesser-known songs like “Sparks” from The Who’s album Tommy as the theme for Crowe’s alter-ego William Miller. The music is essentially a whole other character – a narrator who offers running commentary on the scenarios the others find themselves in. And there are few scenes more uplifting than the one in Almost Famous where, having retrieved guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) from a drugs and alcohol-fuelled party, the fictional band Stillwater and their crew take up a rowdy singalong to Elton John’s “Tiny Dancer”.Prince\u0027s acting debut took place in a film that also produced one of his greatest works. The concept for the plot, about a talented but tortured frontman of a band in Minneapolis, was developed by Prince during his 1999 tour. Purple Rain was one of the 10 highest-grossing films of 1984 and shows Prince as his best and most outrageous self. Yet the songs also provided a window through the Purple One\u0027s enigmatic facade, to reveal the soul beneath.The Wu-Tang Clan’s RZA worked with director Quentin Tarantino on the collection of music that would accompany Uma Thurman’s character The Bride on her bloody quest for revenge. What is particularly brilliant is the alternation between non-diegetic sound and the silence that precedes and lasts during some of the most tense action sequences. When it comes to the most crucial battle between O-Ren Ishii and The Bride at the end of the film, they first chose the disco flamenco intro from Santa Esmeralda\u0027s Latin arrangement of “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood”. At the gory conclusion, where O-Ren falls, RZA and Tarantino used Meiko Kaji’s “The Flower of Carnage”. The song was first used in the 1973 martial arts film Lady Snowblood, in which Kaji starred. She sings: “I’m a woman who walks at the brink of life and death Who emptied my tears many moons ago” and then: “I’ve immersed my body in the river of vengeance.” It\u0027s as though the song was written with The Bride in mind.Guðnadóttir’s nomination is the seventh for a female composer writing an original score. Past nominees include Ann Ronell, Rachel Portman, Anne Dudley and most recently, Mica Levin for her work on Jackie.\u0026nbsp The English composer and conductor Angela Morley was nominated twice in the Seventies for Best Adaptation Score, a category which no longer exists.The Oscars 2020 ‘honest posters’ are more hilarious than everSalma Hayek shares touching throwback photo with Antonino BanderasAdam Sandler responds to Oscars snub for Uncut GemsAt the 2020 Oscars the Icelandic composer will be the only newcomer in the category.

Daniel Kaluuya and Jodie Turner-Smith are the unlikely couple thrust together on a go-nowhere blind date, only for tragedy to transform them into folk heroes roaming across the USA searching for shelter. It’s a spellbinding debut. (Adam White) Guaranteed to be one of the major players in next year’s Oscars, Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite works better the less you know about it. What you should know is that it is a devilishly inventive deconstruction of class, brimming with energy, dark humour and nervous tension. (Adam White) Rising from the ashes of the aborted Universal Monsters multiverse, which was due to star Johnny Depp and Tom Cruise, this rebooted Invisible Man uses the iconic branding to tell the smaller and far more intriguing story of a woman on the run from her invisible ex. Elisabeth Moss is the domestic violence survivor convinced that her supposedly dead boyfriend has merely mastered the art of invisibility. Leigh Whannell, who directed 2018’s wonderfully inventive sci-fi thriller Upgrade, is behind the camera. (Adam White) A Quiet Place would surely have been better off as a standalone film, but the financial success of writer-director John Krasinski’s B-movie-style horror tale put paid to that. This isn’t to say there’s no more story to tell. In fact, Krasinski made no secret of the fact he had a whole universe he could one day explore, and sure enough, joining returning stars Emily Blunt, Millicent Thomas and Noah Jupe (so brilliant in Honey Boy) are new additions in the form of Cillian Murphy and Djimon Honsou. (Jacob Stolworthy) 519 No Time to DieWhile Daniel Craig’s Bond tenure has been marked by severe whiplash in terms of quality, there remains something incredibly exciting about the arrival of a new 007 movie. No Time to Die, Craig’s final outing as the super-spy, also boasts an intoxicating array of talent on and off screen, from Cary Fukunaga on directorial duties, to a script co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge and cast newcomers including Ana de Armas, Rami Malek and Lashana Lynch. (Adam White) Little is known about the plot for Antebellum, the feature film debut of artists and music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. But the thriller\u0027s trailer is a visual feast, with Janelle Monáe appearing to be caught between the present day and the horrors of a 19th century plantation. From producer Jordan Peele, director of Get Out and Us, it also features Jena Malone, Gabourey Sidibe and Kiersey Clemons. (Adam White)719 The Woman in the WindowAn adaptation of the pulpy bestseller (which itself was engulfed in mystery when a New Yorker feature claimed its author, AJ Finn, had extensively lied about his personal life and history), The Woman in the Window puts Amy Adams centre stage for the first time since 2018’s Sharp Objects. She’s an agoraphobic psychologist convinced she has witnessed a murder across the street from her apartment. Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Brian Tyree Henry co-star. (Adam White) Watchmen star Yahya Abdul-Mateen III continues his incredible ascent with the starring role in this remake. Produced by the ubiquitous Jordan Peele, the new Candyman revives the hook-handed killer originated in 1992’s genuinely terrifying Bernard Rose film, but with a black and female director and predominantly black cast – which ought to mean the frustratingly ambiguous racial themes of the original can finally be given their due. (Adam White) The sequel to 2017’s mega successful Wonder Woman is a rare thing: a DC film worthy of excitement. The first outing saw Patty Jenkins become the highest-grossing woman director in cinema history, and she’s looking to beat her own record with a follow-up centred on the Amazon princess’s battle against a villain named Cheetah (Kristen Wiig in her superhero film debut). That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter.

That Jenkins describes it as “a grand tentpole like they use to make in the 1980s” is reason alone to mark its release on your 2020 calendar. (Jacob Stolworthy) Soul is a curious new Pixar film that appears to emulate the philosophical wonder of Inside Out with the lived-in cultural exploration of Coco. Jamie Foxx is a struggling musician who finally gets his big break, only to experience a freak accident that propels him into a mysterious netherworld in which souls are imbued with talents and passions, before being implanted in newborn babies. It looks gorgeous, is potentially insane, and is co-written by Tina Fey. (Adam White) Hours after the first reviews of both Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Cats took over social media, Warner Bros dropped the trailer for Tenet, Christopher Nolan’s top secret espionage thriller. It’s fair to say plenty of sunshine was stolen – and for good reason. Tenet marks Nolan’s return to the mind-melting thrills of Inception and, while the plot remains unknown, it seems to focus on a team of heroes who must rewind time to prevent the outbreak of war. Sign us up. (Jacob Stolworthy) Tom Cruise is taking a (short) break from carrying out impossible missions in 2020. Instead, he’ll return to the cockpit for a sequel to the daddy of all Eighties films, Top Gun. There’ll surely be an element of “teach new dogs old tricks” in the Joseph Kosinski-directed film as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell mentors a new generation of US Navy fighter pilots. We’re hopeful the result will – wait for it – take our breath away. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1319 Barb and Star Go to Vista Del MarIt’s not the Bridesmaids sequel everyone begged for nearly a decade ago, but Barb and Star is its spiritual follow-up at least. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo, the women behind the 2011 smash, write and star in this new comedy, playing two best friends who venture out of their small Midwestern community for the very first time. They soon get mixed up in a villainous plot to kill an entire town, while Jamie Dornan and Damon Wayans Jr also star. (Adam White) 1419 The Many Saints of NewarkWhether you like it or not, a film prequel based on The Sopranos is being released in 2020. The presence of David Chase, the HBO show’s creator, goes a long way to abate any concerns fans might have, and it’ll at least be a fine chance to explore the mobsters’s family history. The film is expected to focus on Dickie Moltisanti, the father of Christopher, whose memory loomed large over the series. (Jacob Stolworthy) 1519 Last Night in SohoEdgar Wright is adding “psychological horror” to his filmmaking repertoire with Last Night in Soho, a neon-soaked thrill ride starring quite the ensemble (Anya Taylor-Joy, Matt Smith, Diana Rigg). The intriguing plot focuses on a young girl for whom “time falls apart” after she’s somehow transported to the 1960s. It sounds like a cult hit in waiting. (Jacob Stolworthy) The feel-good West End smash is transformed into a feel-good movie, with Richard E Grant, Sarah Lancashire and Sharon Horgan leading the story of a teenage boy who overcomes insecurity by embracing drag. Newcomer Max Harwood portrays the title character. (Adam White) Regardless of whether you’re a keen follower of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or not, The Eternals should pique your interest. Sure, it may be spearheading a brand new phase of Marvel franchises – there really is no end to the studios’ box office stronghold – but it features what has to be one of the most eclectic casts ever seen in a superhero film: Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Brian Tyree Henry and Salma Hayek. Colour us intrigued. (Jacob Stolworthy) Alberto E. RodriguezGetty Images for DisneyA remake of David Lynch’s Dune would ordinarily cause our eyeballs to rattle around our sockets, but not when Denis Villeneuve’s in the director’s chair. So committed to his vision is Warner Bros that they ignored the fact his breathtaking Blade Runner sequel flopped and handed him the keys to a fresh adaptation of Herbert Ross’ novel. He did direct Prisoners, Enemy and Arrival, after all. Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya head up the cast. (Jacob Stolworthy) Long in the works, Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story looks set to be a festive smash this time next year. Speculated to be closer in spirit to the original Stephen Sondheim musical than the iconic 1961 film, this new version casts Ansel Elgort as Tony and newcomer Rachel Zegler as Maria – the latter, incredibly, beat out more than 30,000 candidates for the role, after submitting an audition video via Twitter. (Adam White)The director praised Ingmar Bergman’s drama-fantasy Fanny and Alexander, drawing similarities to what he aimed to do with HBO for this project: “You have a three-hour theatrical version and a three-hour TV version. So my goal is to create a high quality expanded version of Parasite”.Parasite director Bong Joon-ho to turn film into limited series for HBBong\u0026nbspis working with McKay to produce the series. The acclaimed director is behind the award-winning HBO series Succession, comedy-drama The Big Short, and the Dick Cheney biopic Vice.Parasite made Oscars history this year as the first South Korean film to be nominated for Best Picture and Best International Film. Bong\u0026nbspwas also feted with Best Director, as well as Best Original Screenplay together with co-writer Han Jin Won.HBO’s corporate sibling TNT are also in the long process of producing a TV adaptation of Bong’s previous feature film, Snowpiercer, although Bong himself is not attached.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was swiftly suspended by the Labour Peers Group, meaning he will have to sit as an independent while he completes a training programme.It emerged during the course of her investigation that Lord Lea had been the subject of 18 complaints between 2011 and 2019, including one about making a racially offensive comment and\u0026nbsp15\u0026nbspabout shouting at staff, aggression and making unreasonable demands.\u0026nbspThe first complainant who spoke to Ms Scott-Moncreiff said Lord Lea had behaved inappropriately towards her during an parliamentary trip more than a decade ago by suggesting that they share\u0026nbspa bottle of champagne in his hotel room – a suggestion denied by the peer. They instead shared the bottle of wine in a hotel lobby. Because the incident was so long ago, it\u0026nbspwas not included in the formal investigation.Labour leader hopeful Long-Bailey: ‘I’d abolish the House of Lords’However, in 2018, nine years after the trip,\u0026nbspthe peer sent the same woman a parcel containing a framed photo of her taken during the trip and a letter that mentioned\u0026nbspthem drinking the champagne during the visit.In the letter, Lord Lea told her that he had placed a copy of the photo on his piano at home, and invited\u0026nbspher for a cup of tea or “to finish that bottle of champagne”.When the allegations were put to him, Lord Lea apologised for the “unwelcome intrusion” and said he had made a “serious error of judgement” in sending the letter. However, he also said he did not fully understand the complainant’s distress and suggested that it was in part because she may have “had some feelings of affections for me which she thought I had torn up”. He also suggested that she was\u0026nbsp“exaggerating” or “egging the pudding in some way” and had “put two and two together and made a lot more than four”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also invited her to have tea and a drink with him.Lord Lea admitted using the rhyme and said he was “deeply sorry”, although he insisted that he was “certainly not making advances”.Ms Scott-Moncreiff\u0026nbspsaid Lord Lea had agreed to take part in “bespoke training and behaviour change coaching” and that both complainants had agreed with this course of action.But asked why there had been so many complaints against him, the peer appeared to blame his lack of IT skills. He speculated that many of the complaints would have come from parliamentary IT staff “because I am hopeless at IT and I get very frustrated sometimes on that”.A Labour Lords spokesperson said: “The chief whip has informed Lord\u0026nbspLea that he is suspended from the Labour Peers Group until further notice.

They will doubtless make big money. But the firestorm of criticism they have ignited here will become an inferno.It is a disastrous mess and may get worse. The couple’s assumption about the public continuing to fund round-the-clock security in Canada looks ­premature — and must be reviewed.Harry is worth £million, Meghan another £million. How much richer must they be before they pay that bill WHY is the Government still so coy about celebrating the moment of Brexit Leaving the EU at pm on January  will be a huge milestone in our modern history, the end of our -year membership and the starting gun for negotiating a lucrative new era of trade.The Sun wants Big Ben to bong.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me. The Queen has said she wants this sorted out and without delay.Many have called this an abdication and in one sense it is. Harry and Meghan expect to still have a handle on royal duty but also to lead a private le.What they mean by living financially independent, I don’t know. They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow. The sums he inherited from his mother and great grandmother have been invested.Meghan has some means but to live the sort of lestyle they are used to takes a lot of money.It is conceivable Charles could cut the money he gives to Harry —he gives him any at all. Being a dad, he probably will.But there are tax implications — particularlythere are handouts.Security has also to be considered. Harry is a prince of the United Kingdom, his grandmother head of state and father heir.The atmosphere at the meeting will be, up to a point, heated. But people won’t lose their tempers.The Queen is pragmatic. She understands problems people have but Harry will be fully aware of her displeasure. To go off half-cocked as he and Meghan did is unacceptable.The question is how dare they do that. She signed up for this.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

Why let reality spoil the narrative These claims made about the “racist” treatment of Meghan at the hands of the British Press are incredibly thin.The same non-examples are recycled over and over again. You have probably seen them quoteda thousand times.There is that Daily Mail piece from , when Harry and Meghan were first dating, that said she was “ straight outta Compton”.At the time, Meghan’s mother Doria Ragland lived in nearby Crenshaw, LA.Hirsch says this was an attempt to link Meghan with “racialised forms of crime”, meaning gangs.That is one hell of a reach. The piece was clearly just playing on the dference in Harry and Meghan’s social backgrounds.If Harry had been dating a white, working-class woman from Manchester’s Moss Side, I dare say the Mail would have done something similarly silly.Another favourite is that weird throwaway line Boris Johnson’s sister Rachel wrote, in a laudatory piece on Meghan, about the mixed-race American actress bringing some “rich and exotic DNA” to the pale Windsor bloodline. That is more cringey than racist.Several pieces have cited a single phrase in a Sarah Vine column for the Mail — she said she had a “niggling worry” about the royal couple’s engagement photo — as a bigoted dog whistle. That is, quite frankly, mental.Such is the lack of actual examples of the Press being racist about Meghan.The only leg this argument has left to stand on is that the sheer volume of criticism sent Meghan’s way was disproportionate.Racism is the only explanation for it. It’s an argument based purely on unveriable speculation and imputing motives. It is also b*****ks.When the couple first got together, the coverage was gushing across the board.It was only when Meghan and Harry started on their ious virtue-signalling cru-sades — such as jetting around to lecture on climate change — that people’s backs went up.That the couple had already been beefing with the Press probably didn’t help either.In , way before Meghan became a figure in our culture wars, Harry issued a remarkable statement rebuking journalists for the “racial undertones” of their pieces.That these privileged royals, kept in the lap of luxury at taxpayers’ expense, began to develop a deep-seated victim complex only heightened the resentment towards them.Last year, Meghan told ITV public le was a “struggle” and she was shocked that “not many people have askedI’m OK”. Poor princess.This picture of privilege is who the liberal Left has spent the best part of three years defending.Even supposed republicans have — after a bit of anti-royal throat-clearing — defended Harry and Meghan to the hilt and helped con- struct this absurd narrative that they are the victims of establishment racism.This says far more about the prejudices of liberal-Left commentators than it does about the tabloid Press. They routinely suggest Meghan’s supposed mistreatment in Brexit Britain is no coincidence.They think Britain is a foul place full of foul people, brainwashed by foul news- papers to hate the wonderful Duchess of Sussex and the brilliant European Union.What the liberal elite’s Meghanmania shows us is that, for all their posturing against right-wingers, monarchy and the old aristocracy, they are comfortable with the plebs being led, instructed and hectored by our betters.They would just rather it was woke people doing it, like Harry and Meghan. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which Meghan did not attend as she remains Canada with eight-month-old Archie - the Queen reportedly made it clear Harry and his we were part of the vision for a slimmed down monarchy.It was previously reported the couple had felt driven out by the Royal Family - including feeling excluded from the recent line of succession photo which saw the Queen beaming alongside her heirs Prince George, Prince William and Prince Charles.But while Her Majesty yesterday appealed to the couple to stay in the UK to work with the family -

Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time workingMembers of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent le as a family while remaining a valued part of my family.“Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.“It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK.“These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

racism","story":"Ebrima Mboob, originally from Gambia, West Africa, arranged over Facebook to view a double room to rent in central London from landlord Elina Vimbsone.Mr Mboob claims that once Ms Vimbsone realised where he was from, she back-peddled by declaring: “It’s only for European people”.The -year-old – studying performing arts at the University of the Arts London – said he “could not believe it” when his viewing was abruptly cancelled because of his ethnicity.He said: “I was completely shocked at the landlord’s response and I still am today.“Growing up in England, I’ve experienced all types of racism, but this was the first time that I’ve experienced something this absurd.“What makes it even more shocking is the fact she said ‘will be brilliantyou can make the time to come and view’, but soon changed her mind once she realised I was black.“I wasn’t expecting her to even ask me about my background as I didn’t think it was relevant and she even had the nerve to say it wasn’t racist.Mr Mboob added how the ordeal has left him feeling self-conscious when cooking African food in case other people have the same perception.“She even tried to play it down by saying how she has Nigerian friends and that all their houses smell like what they cook,” he concluded.“I’ve just moved in with new housemates and I’ve developed serious anxiety about cooking around them in case they hate the smell too.”Ms Vimbsone declined to comment when approached by The Sun Online.Under the Race Relations Act it is unlawful for a landlord to discriminate against a tenant on racial grounds.The Act defines racial grounds as including race, colour, nationality or ethnic or national origins.According to the Race Relations Act, there are four main types of racial discrimination: direct, indirect, victimisation and harassment.Direct racial discrimination takes place when you are able to show that you have been treated less favorably on racial grounds than others in a comparable situation.It occurs when:Refusing to rent or let a property based on race is unlawful as it breaches section  of the Equality Act .In , Fergus Wilson – Britain’s biggest buy-to-let landlord – banned ”coloured” people - because he said they make his properties smell of curry.Mr Wilson issued the directive in an email to lettings agents Evolution, who handled some of his hundreds of rental properties.The email, which was leaked to The Sun, listed his requirements for potential tenants.One said: “No coloured people because of the curry smell at the end of the tenancy.”Mr Wilson, , who was once reported to own up to , properties in Kent, said: “To be honest, we’re getting overloaded with coloured people.“It is a problem with certain types of coloured people - those who consume curry - it sticks to the carpet.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum living in moulded infested flat hertfordshire","story":"Lisa Dyer, , shares the property in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, with daughters, Angel,

His seriousness and intellect help at the despatch box, but he could do with sometimes showing his lighter side. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He warned the party must not oversteer back to the centre. He said: The case for a radical Labour government has never been stronger”. And he called for the party to take on the narrative that Boris Johnson can aposget Brexit doneapos by the end of January.  REBECCA LONG-BAILEY,  -   Salford  Eccles  PROFILE: John McDonnell’s and other Corbyn alliesapos preferred successor for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor has been grooming her for the top job. The shadow business secretary’s quiet demeanour belies a fiery passion for addressing social justice. Laura Pidcock’s failure to win a seat has cleared the way for her to be the candidate of the Left. She says sheaposs seriously considering running for the leadership - and will back flatmate Angela Rayner for the deputy leadershipshe runs. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: The MP confirmed her run with an unapologetic praising of Jeremy Corbynaposs policies - which she helped write. Defending Jeremy Corbyn’s legacy, she wrote in the : “Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards. We didn’t lose because of our commitments to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees.” However, in comments which will be seen as an attempt to dferentiate herself from the Labour leader, she also wrote: From ex-miners in Blythe Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities. Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working le, built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared le of everyone. To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain.  LISA NANDY,  -   Wigan  PROFILE: The eloquent backbencher was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Her links with powerful Union unite could help any run. Has hinted at a joint bid with David Lammy. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She argued Labour is facing the last chance to save itself as a whole, not from warring factions, and win back older and working-class voters. Itaposs about whether that traditional coalition that has propelled us into power three times in the last  years can hold good, and whether we can speak for both Lewisham and Leigh.  JESS PHILLIPS,  -   Birmingham Yardley  PROFILE: The powerful voice is one of Labour’s strongest media performers who has the ability to speak “human” and the ability to tack between funny quips and powerful speeches. She is the chair of Labour’s women’s PLP and has been a strong supporter of all-women shortlists - perhaps suggesting she could push for them to be extended to the leadership race. But as she admitted herself on election night, the leadership race is “more than just a personality game and I know that people like me because I have a personality, and that will never just be enough.” WHAT SHEaposS SAID: “Now is not the time to play it safe. What I’ve heard so far in this debate is totally inadequate to the scale of the problem. Voters have changed, the electoral map has been transformed, communication in a social media age is dferent. We need to recognise that politics has changed in a fundamental way by electing a dferent kind of leader. More of the same will lead to more of the same result.”EMILY THORNBERRY,  -   Islington South  Finsbury  PROFILE: An impressive performer - both in front of crowds and on the media. The shadow foreign secretary is a quick thinker, belly-laugh funny and has experience of going up against Boris Johnson at the despatch box. But she quit the frontbench in  after being accused of snobbery by tweeting a picture of a house decked out in St George’s flags, with a white van parked outside. And there are concerns another leader from Islington might not be the answer Labour is looking for. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She stood by her decision to back a second Brexit referendum, saying Jeremy Corbyn was let down and badly advised by top aides. She also called for the New Year Honours to extend to the dead and said she will promise to quit as leader before an electionthe polls and opinion show she canapost win.  Dropped out CLIVE LEWIS,  Norwich South   PROFILE: A former BBC correspondent Mr Lewis has straddled the ide in the Labour party between Corbynistas and more moderate MPs. He resigned as shadow Defence Secretary after attempts by Mr Corbyn’s office to water down the party’s support for Trident. But the Norwich South MP has also been a vocal supporter of many of the soon to be ex-Labour leader’s policies. Despite being a confident media performer, his profile has been diminished since he left the Shadow Cabinet. And his compromise position means he hasn’t endeared himself to loyalists on either side of the party’s left right ide - meaning he may struggle to pick up support. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He called for the party membership to be given more powers than they were under Corbyn, backed proportional representation and said Labouraposs indecisiveness over Brexit hurt them. In contrast with most current analysis he suggested that the party had still not gone far enough to break with the Blair and Brown era. HOW HE DROPPED OUT: Mr Lewis withdrew from the contest  minutes before the close of PLP nominations. He said: At this stage, it’s clear that I won’t get on the ballot. So, I’m standing aside in the spirit of pluralism, ersity and generosity that I’ve promoted throughout this campaign, so that those who have supported me can recast their nominations.Ruled themselves out BARRY GARDINER,  Brent North    PROFILE: The longest serving MP of the leadership hopefuls, Mr Gardiner has represented Brent North since . Mr Gardiner was a minister under Tony Blair , voted in favour of military action in Iraq in  and nominated David Miliband for leadership in . However, in recent years he has been a loyal defender of Jeremy Corbyn, often picked as the partyaposs spokesman and media defender in the Shadow Cabinet.  The -year-old former City arbitrator is the son of an Olympic footballer and a celebrated surgeon. He was brought up in Glasgow, going on to study at St Andrews. He counts climate change amongst his key concerns, speaking to the media about his potential leadership bid from an environmental conference in Abu Dhabi. In , he became the mayor of Cambridge- the youngest in the city’s  year history. He came under fire during the expenses scandal for owning a second home, despite being based near Westminster. He voluntarily paid back £,.. YVETTE COOPER,  Pontefract  Castleford  PROFILE: Yvette Cooper saw her odds slashed from   to   after she said she was considering throwing her hat into the ring. She is seen as a competent politician having chaired the Home Affairs Select Committee and with respect from MPs from the parliament. But four years ago she lost to Jeremy Corbyn . The former Cabinet minister who came second in the contest in  winning % of the vote compared to Mr Corbynaposs % said she would decide over Christmas whether to enter the race. Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She said both the left and right of the party are seen as internationalist rather than patriotic and Labour mustto its support in towns and former heartlands, not just the erse young fast-moving cities in England. However the Mirror reported she was unlikely to run after taking soundings from colleagues.  IAN LAVERY,  Wansbeck  PROFILE: A bruiser who began his career at Northumberland’s Lynemouth Colliery, Ian Lavery was thrown into politics by the s Miners’ Strike. The -year-old succeeded Arthur Scargill as National Union of Mineworkers President in  before becoming an MP in . The Jeremy Corbyn loyalist, whose region backed Leave by % to %, was one of the few Shadow Cabinet ministers to adamantly back Brexit after the  referendum. That led to clashes between the father-of-two, a football, cricket and boxing fan, and top MPs who wanted to Remain. Despite being Labour’s joint elections co-ordinator since , Mr Lavery very nearly paid a heavy personal price over Brexit. His , majority in Wansbeck was slashed to  in the general election as a ‘red wall’ of Labour heartlands turned blue.Mr Lavery was previously dogged by press coverage about £, he received from a union he ran, which by  had only  recorded members. The money included just under £, in termination payments”, when Mr Lavery was made redundant as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area on becoming an MP in May . Mr Lavery has always vehemently denied wrongdoing, either by himself or the union, and the Certication Office for trade unions decided not to investigate further in an October  report. WHAT HEaposS SAID: Talk of a second referendum was seen by many as a way to foist Remain upon them. Communities represented by Labour for generations felt abandoned. It is time to outline a positive vision of the future outside of the EU. Divided parties can’t win. Let’s get back to debating in a forthright but respectful way, remembering what we have in common and stop reinforcing press attacks on our own party. ANGELA RAYNER,  Ashton-under-Lyne  Long tipped for the top job, her back story of rising to the top of politics despite leaving school after getting pregnant at  is inspirational. She later trained as a care worker and eventually became a trade union representative with Unison, who would be likely to back her for the top job. The shadow education secretary has become an increasingly polished performer, but Labour insiders claim that she is still a work in progress.But sheaposs going for the deputy leadership instead. DAVID LAMMY,  Tottenham  PROFILE: The campaigner first entered Parliament in  and served in Tony Blair’s government but failed to be promoted. But he showed he can shape-sht politically after keeping out of many of the factional battles that have rocked Labour since . Instead the ardent Remainer - who also ran for the London mayoral nomination in  - devoted himself to highlighting the Windrush scandal and campaigning against Brexit. Mr Lammy, who would be Labour’s first black leader, may bridge the class ide at the heart of Labour’s woes. He grew up in Tottenham and lost a friend in Grenfell but also studied at Hard and became a barrister. But his outspoken opinions on social media - such as criticising the “white saviour” approach of Comic Relief - have prompted rows in the past.

They put “blood, sweat and tears” into the two-bed dump, bought under a council regeneration scheme. Debbie and Ste were shaken when they first stepped through the door – armed with a £, schedule of works from Liverpool City Council to bring it up to scratch. The th century terraced house had been hit by fire and had crumbling walls, broken bricks and burnt joists. But the couple worked -, did most of the renovations themselves and in  months transformed it into a cosy home for just £,. After enjoying their first Christmas in the double-fronted home in the city’s Wavertree district, the pair have been buoyed by a valuation of £,. Debbie, , says: “We never want to move because we have put so much of ourselves into this house. People thought we were nuts. “We’ve crawled on the floors, we built the floors… it’s a gamble we took and we love it. Our blood and guts have gone into it. If they’d give us next door, we’d do it again!” Recalling the first time she saw the property, Debbie says: “It was just a shell. All the joists were burnt. It was terrible. “Honestly, it was just stacks and stacks of bricks. There was nothing. My family were saying to me, ‘You’re mad’.”  Every floor had to be replaced, chimneys were removed, the sinking kitchen was underpinned, all fittings were ripped out and the windows were upgraded. Debbie and Ste, , used their savings and took a small loan to complete the work – and it was hard graft. We were there until midnight with torches. We went seven days a week, we didn’t miss a day,” Debbie says. She scoured local ads for bargains and bagged a £, kitchen for a tenth of the price and a £, bathroom suite for £,. They also picked up a slightly damaged £, front door for £.  And, slowly but surely, the place came together. Now it is a shining example of how Liverpool is breathing new le into former slums. The council unveiled its Homes For A Pound scheme in . A year later, bosses vowed that , empty houses would be brought back into use. Since then, , homes have been reoccupied – including  in the Webster Triangle, Wavertree, where the Hodges live. Seven more families are due to move in soon. A similar scheme has since been launched in Stoke-on-Trent. Last year, a Channel  documentary about the renovations in Liverpool featured Debbie and Ste.  The couple say the sense of community in the Webster Triangle is a great example of how councils candepressed areas to homely neighbourhoods. The Hodges used to rent in Anfield and had struggled to get a mortgage. Debbie suffered a serious long-term illness and Ste’s wages as a carpet cleaner were not enough to secure a home loan. Debbie says: “The council scheme was the best thing to happen to us. It brings communities together. When we moved in, there were only about three houses in the road occupied. But it’s moving on now, it’s coming to be more of a community and about half the street is filled.  “We’ve met all the neighbours and introduced ourselves. People come from everywhere, dferent areas, dferent countries. It’s a lovely community and I’m really settled here. I just love it. Once a month we clean the street and make it nice. The area is coming up, there are bars and restaurants opening further down the road… I just wouldn’t move. “I can definitely see the area getting better and we’ve never been so happy.” The couple have two daughters – Jade, , a psychologist who has her own home, and -year-old teaching assistant Jenna, who still lives with her parents and is studying for an MSC. Debbie hopes the Homes For A Pound scheme will help young Liverpudlians like Jenna get on the property ladder.

Fair enough, said Harry and Meghan, we will. Cue the eruption. The critics want to have their cake and eat it. As in any dysal situation, they dismiss anything from the Sussexes unless it falls into line with whatever they want. Harry – forced to walk through London behind his mother’s coffin as a -year-old – can’t open up on his mental health issues without being attacked as weak. Meghan can’t breathe without being vilied for showing a lack of consideration to the Queen, the Crown, the flag and the Empire. The Sussexes are not allowed to set their own boundaries. Not when “duty” demands they are there to be pushed around.Of course, race has played a part in it. That much is obvious to large sections of black and white Britain. Yes, Camilla, Diana and Sarah Ferguson were also treated badly, but not like this. Not with the sustained vitriol that Meghan has had to endure. From her son being mocked up as a chimp to criticising her for editing Vogue – even though Prince Harry edited Radio ’s Today programme and Kate edited the Huffington Post website. Social media critics claimed bi-racial Meghan was not pure enough to marry into the Firm. The inference has always been that she doesn’t belong. She has been derided as a a, intent on wrecking the Royal Family. The so-called “constitutional crisis” is Harry and Meghan fighting back.  They are young people who want to go their own way. Millions of families have them. Kids who decide they want no part of the way things have been done in the past, children of rock stars who aren’t interested in music, footballers’ kids who don’t like sport. Frankly, the Sussexes are right to put themselves and their own wellbeing first. Of course, Home Secretary Priti Patel can’t see the problem. She serves under a Prime Minister whose overt racism is well documented. This debate, however, could yet become a turning point for our media. Most of the royal commentators stamping their feet over this are white. Most of the newsrooms covering this are largely white. The real time backlash is from black Britons with a digital  who are determined to have their say.  Angry, polarised race-baiting for social media hits is not the answer. The solution is a better ethnic mix in our media to give us an understanding of how to address this issue. Royal Author Penny Junor was left stumped on CBS This Morning when she vehemently insisted race was not a factor in Meghan’s treatment. “Did you check in with any black Britons before you made that determination ” asked the presenter. Junor was left stuttering. It appeared she hadn’t. All Meghan has done is back her husband as he chooses to move out of his grandmother’s house and fend for himself.

Emily Evans-Schreiber, , from Naseby, Northamptonshire was caught out after her own mother became suspicious of her designer clothes, international trips, beauty treatments and five-star hotels. Northampton Crown Court heard how she made  transactions totalling £, between April and December . Evans-Schreiber pleaded guilty to theft and was given a suspended prison sentence of two-years, along with  hours of unpaid work and an alcohol treatment programme. The mum-of-one only had £ in her bank account when she was asked to help care for her -year-old grandmother Rosina Evans who was terminally ill with dementia. Evans-Schreiber was put in charge of her grandmotheraposs finances after her family became concerned about her lestyle in London and tasked her with caring for her grandma in April .

The couple want to be internationally protected people as they step back from their roles as senior members of the Royal Family, splitting their time between North America and the UK. Their security is currently funded by the tax payer but there are questions as to how this would continue in their new positions.According to The Times , Scotland Yard is already struggling to train enough specialist officers to cope with the increasing demands of the Royal Family.A source told the newspaper that the couple have not thought out the security implications of their move and have put the Met in an impossible position. A top American bodyguard who is nicknamed the Secret Service of Hollywood has estimated that the cost of protecting the couple privately could be an eye-watering million, which is about £.million.Russell Stuart, who founded Force Protection Agency, told DailyMail the couple would need between two and four guards between them at all times and people watching each of their homes at all times. He told the site: Eventhey become private citizens the idea that they could pop to the grocery store - that is probably never going to happen. There are two of the most famous people on the planet. Because of that running their security detail comes with an incredible amount of pressure and its own set of additional problems. And they will need security now more than ever. There are a lot of bad people in the world. Any transitional period would offer them an opportunity.  Their security bill has still to be managed, set between £, and £million, considerably moreiding their time between countries. It was one of the six points discussed at crisis talks between the Queen, Harry, Charles and William at Sandringham yesterday.

Gathering in the Long Library of the family’s th Century Sandringham estate, the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry looked each other in the eye and agreed to find a resolution. Her Majesty had appealed for calm in the face of days of tension from her family and household staff that had threatened to boil over. Those battling against the winds of change as Harry and we Meghan plotted their move away, were beckoned to the table to carve a way forward. With the world’s eyes on a tiny corner of Norfolk, the -year-old monarch presided over one of the most extraordinary days of her seven decade reign. Chairing the meeting, across a large polished table with room for eight chairs, the Queen and her family set out their vision of how a new version of monarchy would emerge. Over the next two hours they thrashed out the framework of a deal to stop the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from permanently turning their backs on the family. But the brutal reality remained, that little more than  months after marrying in a wedding that captured the hearts of the nation, Harry and Meghan had effectively resigned from The Firm citing feelings of relentless pressure and an unsupportive network  The couple, who have patented more than  items from intellectual property to bandanas, plan a takeover on the global stage where they can earn millions with Meghan’s star power and Hollywood connections lining up to help. But with Harry wavering under renewed requests for calm from his beloved grandmother, the hope is the family will still be able to persuade the couple to change tack and plan a soft Megxit to safeguard their future and the monarchy for a generation. Sources close to the negotiations have revealed the family set six main points to be agreed on before real change could take affect.  The six key points Titles The Queen referred to the couple by their first names and not by their titles in her statement. Does this mean they will lose their titles  Finances The couple have been asked to suggest a plan to fulfil their wish to be “financially independent”. Deals to be approved by The Palace. Protection The Queen and other royals have vowed to find a “workable approach” to security issues. Canada has reportedly said it would pay.  Advisers The pair took advice from PR gurus in the US, Sir Elton John and Oprah Winfrey. Senior royals want to know exactly who works for them. Media plan Senior royals will demand to knowHarry and Meghan are planning to do a ‘tell-all’ interview – and who would host it. Where they live Any new home would have to be assessed by the UK security services and Buckingham Palace due to security concerns. What happens next  Crucially with the Queen’s blessing, Harry and Meghan will now split their time between the UK and Canada as “a period of transition” takes place, nullying the need for the immense haste which the Sussexes had been so keen to implement. Central to discussions was the way in which the couple will move towards becoming “financially independent” They revealed they would stop claiming public funds, believed to be in excess of a £million a year, but it is thought they would still claim expenses for travel and office costs Despite being worth more than £million in their own right, the couple are still yet to announce whether they will give up the £. million a year subsidy from Prince Charles from his private income. Their security bill has still to be managed, set between £, and £million, considerably moreiding their time between countries.  They were buoyed today by reports Canadian prime minister has agreed to foot the bill when the duke and duchess are residents in his country. Justin Trudeau had previously tweeted “‘You’re among friends, and always welcome here’” when news broke of the Sussexes escape to Vancouver for their extended break over Christmas and new year. The Queen’s advisors have made clear the Sussexesapos responsibilities moving forward when signing corporate deals and Harry has agreed he would never purposely seek to bring controversy to his family.  He told how neither he nor his we have plans to do a tell all interview after close associates of the couple said that any proposition would not be pretty for the monarchy. Key to any discussions moving forward will be the Queen’s private secretary Sir Edward Young, Prince Charles’s canny private secretary Clive Alderton and William’s top aide and former civil servant Simon Case. Prince Harry’s private secretary, ex-diplomat Fiona Mcilwham, is expected to complete the group. The Sussexesapos living arrangements are to be mapped out by advisors once Harry and Meghan come up with a range of options.  It is expected they will keep their Frogmore Cottage home that was refurbished with £. million of taxpayers cash just last year. After the meeting the three male principals staged a synchronised exit from the estate in separate cars, with Charles later flying from RAF Marham around  miles away to his Scottish retreat Birkhall where he always has a New Year break. As the sun set on the grounds outside the room where discussions had taken place and the satellite vans of the worlds media trundled off, the Queen was left to consider what the future would look for her family and the country she has serves with distinction after this most historic day.

David Nolan, , took covert pictures of Catherine Holdich, , whenever she went outside - claiming she was trespassing on his land at the bottom of their adjoined properties. Retired engineer Noaln, was convicted of harassing Mrs Holdich over the petty dispute that left cancer sufferer Mrs Holdich with a sinking feeling in her stomach every time she ventured outside her home in Mossley, Greater Manchester. Police issued Nolan with a  warning about his bizarre conduct - but he was later convicted of harassment between  and . This week the widower, who is partially sighted, was convicted of breaching a restraining order which had banned him from contacting the victim.She made a statement against Nolan, but died last year before the case could came to court, reports the Manchester Evening News .In her statement read to Tameside Magistratesapos Court, Miss Holdich who lived with her husband Steven said: aposaposOver a long period of time I have been targeted by our neighbour Mr Nolan. aposaposOver the years have had to put up with all sorts of abuse including Mr Nolan taking pictures of me.  I live in a row of terrace houses ours being the end but for some reason Mr Nolan tried to claim the land at the rear of the houses which included land that Steven and I own. aposaposHe has targeted me but never it appears Steven. I was successful in gaining a court order to protect me from harassment and as a result I finally felt after years of being a victim I could now live in peace. aposaposI underwent a double mastectomy and due to the procedure was hospitalised there for a week. But when I ed home then my husband made me aware he had had an incident with Mr Nolan and I felt upset, I thought that the harassment was starting again.aposapos The court heard the campaign arose out a civil dispute Nolan was waging against Mrs Holdich over a strip of land which had aposaposoverlappedaposapos onto his property from her back garden.  Whenever she went out for walks with her dogs, he would take photographs of her. It was claimed he was verbally abusive towards Miss Holdich shouting and swearing at her and at one stage he did threaten to kill her. He was given a two year restraining order in January  after being convicted of harassment but was questioned by police again after an incident the following April in which he was seen gesturing at her from a window. Mrs Holdichaposs statement added: aposapos We have two dogs and I love getting out and taking them for a walk.  Due to the operation I felt cooped up and on this day felt fine and in the position to go for a small walk and it was a big event for me after the surgery and post op treatment. aposaposAs I ed I was feeling great and felt I was winning my battle and saw Steven at the fence. But at this point there was banging at the window and Mr Nolan at his rear window banging and ranting as he has over the years. He was waving piece of paper, making gestures that we should move. At that he stopped as it must have dawned on him that he had broken the order. aposaposI was distraught, upset and reduced to tears he was starting his campaign against me. I have had to endure years of verbal abuse over the years and I cannot endure anymore threats.  I get a sinking feeling in my stomach whenever I want to take the dogs out for a walk in the morning.  It is one of my favourite times of the day going out for a walk and helps me a lot and it gets me down knowing that he is going to be there. ”My le has been shaken up by the breast cancer and surgery and I feel I can’t go about my le and walking my dog.  I’m begging the courts to help me, protect me from this man who’s venting his anger at me.aposapos Mr Holdich who has lived next door to Nolan for almost  years told the hearing: aposaposCath had just come out of hospital after having a double mastectomy. She hadn’t been out properly and loved walking our dogs.  She wanted to go out and walk the dogs just a little way round the back of the property. aposaposI didn’t walk with her but went so far just to keep an eye on her outside the gate and watched her round the back. But I could see he was yelling at me from his lounge window.  He was behind double glazing but I could tell by his demeanour, he was waving his hands, shouting and  was making reference to a piece of paper in his hand. He was pointing at it and eventually gave me the two fingers. aposaposCath came up and joined me where I was stood, she looked up and said: aposnot again, here we go again.apos With everything  that was going on in our lives at the time it wasn’t something that we needed.  It was really upsetting for both the we and myself.aposapos "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle clip resurfaces online","story":"NewsMeghan Markle clip resurfaces online as fans say it shows who she really isA very sweet video of the Duchess of Sussex interacting with fans at an event back in  has gone viral on social mediaShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video old-meghan-markle-clip-goes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-clip-resurfaces-online-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA neglected seven-year-old boy was found living in a home that resembled a rubbish tip, alongside his drug addict parents. The home was found littered with heroin needles, rotting food and infestations of flies when social services and the police arrived. Leicester Crown Court heard the youngster had vanished off the local authorityaposs radar after moving schools - despite not showing up to school for six months, reports Leicestershire Live. Alexander Wolfson, prosecuting, said there was a multi-agency meeting in December , before the police attended an address in Leicester and found it to be in absolute squalor. He said: The conditions were disgusting, with rotting food and piles of rubbish everywhere. The bedrooms, lounge and bathroom were filthy. The kitchen was rancid with a couple of tins of food left open and evidence of mouse droppings. The stove was inaccessible, there was mouldy food in the fridge and it was dficult to move around. Unfortunately drugs paraphernalia was lying about items associated with taking heroin, with uncapped needles. Cigarette ash was evident and flies. Bags of rubbish were on the upstairs landing. When a drawer in the boyaposs bedroom cupboard was opened a cloud of flies flew into the air, said the prosecutor. He added: There were faeces marks across a wall. The toilet was filthy with no evidence of a toothbrush or toothpaste in the bathroom. The child didnapost appear to have a change of clothes and didnapost have pyjamas. He was not wearing underwear or socks. He did not appear to have toys fit to play with. The boy told officers he had eaten some cookies during the day, but did not appear to have had anything . The foster parents he was placed with reported that he did not want to wash, brush his teeth or have his hair washed and was terried of flies. He was always hungry and had dficulty understanding the dference between day and night. He had not been registered with a GP and needed medication for worms.  The child was placed in school and assessed as being two years behind. However, he did not appear to be malnourished or to have any other medical issues. Mr Wolfsen said the child said he had played on an XBox a lot when living with his parents. He ate bread and butter with ketchup and played with the toaster in his fatheraposs bedroom - and went to bed when he liked. When interviewed, the father said multiple bereavements had left him unable to cope, and he went into a drug-induced downward spiral. The mother accepted the house was in a poor condition saying she only lived there because she had nowhere . Both parents, who are not being named because of a court order protecting the boyaposs identity, pleaded guilty to an offence of child cruelty by neglect. Mr Wolfsen said: Heaposs been doing well in short-term foster care and will be placed into long-term foster care. He has a bright future ahead of him. Heaposs desperate to see his mum and dad and is described as being fiercely loyal to them - and asks about them. They are having supervised contact with him. The distressed mother wept in the dock during the hearing.  Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: This is a dficult sentencing exercise. When it involves an innocent child who has clearly suffered, anyoneaposs instincts would be to mete the harshest penalties on those responsible. One has to look at the facts and the circumstances. He told the parents: The prosecutor tells me youaposve had contact with your son and heaposs expressed a desire to continue contact with you and that he loves you both. Heaposs fiercely loyal to both of you. He obviously now has a bright future and the hardship heaposs suffered is potentially something that can be put behind him. Iaposm dealing with two people who werenapost, by any measure, capable of looking after a child. Iaposve been given details about what led to this awful situation arising. Both of you, historically, have drug problems and thataposs affected the way you live your lives. The court heard that one of the childaposs grandparents had been actively involved in helping to properly care for the boy at a dferent address, but when she died he ended up living where with his parents.  Other deaths in the family led to his father relapsing into former class A drug addiction. The judge said: The photographs of the house speak for themselves. Some of the rooms look like rubbish tips. Heroin needles were around, there was rotten food and flies. A police officer says, in his statement, he retched and almost threw up when he went into the house. Itaposs very fortunate the child has made a full recovery. This wasnapost evil out-and-out cruelty. The parents are themselves incapable and inadequate.

In recent times, some have whispered of a subtle changing of the guard a passing of the torch to prepare Charles and even William for Kingship. Butthere was ever any doubt who remains in charge, those thoughts were laid to rest in one of the most extraordinary days in modern royal history. With a masterful stroke of leadership, the Queen took back control of a situation that had in recent times threatened the fabric of the institution. In her amazing statement, she mentions family eight times. The message is clear: We are united and we will survive.  When a star player causes problems for the rest of the team, any boss worth their mettle will not hesitate to take action. No matter what, no one is bigger than the club. And in this case, that club - revered around the world for its handling of its triumphs as well as its misfortunes - is the monarchy , which the Queen has served so dutully during her  years so far on the throne.

The selfless former nurse, and mum of three daughters, shared her story through a popular blog and Facebook Page as she wanted to comfort and support others living with the illness. Sam said she remained positive right until the end despite becoming almost unable to walk, Leicestershire Live reports.“It’s been a rough couple of years but the last few months have been really rough. Her illness took over quite a lot towards the end”, he said. The -year-old said he is determined to keep raising awareness of lung cancer, as people misconceive that it’s a smoker’s illness, whereas Debbie never smoked. Paying tribute to same, who he married in summer , he said: “She was beautul, she was amazing, she was the nicest, most caring woman I met. She was brilliant, always smiling, even at the end.” Debbie first became ill in February  when she woke up one morning with excruciating back pain and a chest infection. As her pain persisted, she decided to get checked out and a CT scan and biopsy revealed she had a mass on her left lung.  Doctors told Debbie and Sam the devastating news that she had terminal cancer which could only be managed by treatment. Debbie was determined to carry on with le as normal and created a Facebook page, Nurse with the big “C”urse, where she regularly posted photos and updates about her treatment and future plans. She said last year: “I didn’t want sympathy or pity, I just wanted my story to be heard, because when you are given a diagnosis like this, you can have all your close family and friends with you but still feel so isolated, scared and alone.” She spoke of the challenge of living with cancer, saying: “It’s one of the last things I think of at night and within minutes of being awake, it’s there at the forefront of my mind. “I try to distract myself thinking of all the wonderful things I am yet to experience and places I need to visit. It helps me to cope. “I need those goals to aim towards so that on the bad days, it’s my loved ones, goals and memories that get me through.” After Debbie and Sam got married they spent time in Ibiza and Rhodes, despite her illness. Her family announced her death with a post on the Facebook page.  It urged people to “hold on to everyone you love a little tighter and a little longer tonight and never take the good times for granted because le can be so cruel and snatch those precious moments away.”Sam said: “We still did Christmas dinner and everyone came round. In fact, more people came round than we expected.“We had about  to  people. It’s what she would have wanted.” Her funeral at South Leicestershire crematorium was attended by around  people where Chanel read out a poem that was written especially for the occasion.  Sam and around  family friends are taking part in a charity bike ride from Leicester to Skegness in aid of Loros Hospice, who provided care for Debbie in her final weeks. They also plan to keep the blog and Facebook page going. Asked what advice he would give to a family whose loved one had just been given a terminal cancer diagnosis, Sam said: “Everyone takes things dferently, it’s such a hard thing to deal with. “You have to try and be as positive as possible.

She admits that there are still complex matters to be worked through, however says she hopes these will all be sorted by the end of the week. So what does all this mean for our Royal Family, and what will happen next  Harry will remain in the UK until at least Thursday, when he is due to host an event at Buckingham Palace. The Duke is set to host the Rugby League World Cup draw, an engagement that was set before the coupleaposs bombshell announcement but that he is expected to honour. Itaposs believed that he could fly back to Canada to join Meghan and Harry shortly afterwards.The Duchess ed after they announced their decision on Instagram , going undetected on the flight back to Toronto.The couple left Archie in the country when they flew back to break the news, where he was looked after by his nanny and Meghanaposs best friend Jessica Mulroney.  The couples two dogs - a beagle called guy and a black Labrador - are also thought to be with them. Meghan and Harry have no further UK engagements in the calender after the rugby draw, which means we donapost know when weaposll see them officially again.

Sophie Smith, , and her husband Jack, , had given up hope of ever becoming parents to their own children after spending six years and £, on IVF desperately trying to conceive. The couple, from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, went through five devastating miscarriages and two ectopic pregnancies that required both of her fallopian tubes to be removed - leaving Sophie unable to have children of her own. But their despair turned to joy when Sophieaposs best friend, Emiliana Hall, stepped in and offered to carry a baby for the couple. The mum-of-two was pregnant with her son Theo, now two, at the time but was determined to give her friends ‘the greatest gt of le’.  And now, the best pals - who stuck up a friendship on their first day in secondary school - are delighted to be shopping for baby-grows together as Emiliana is six-months pregnant with Sophie and Jackaposs baby. Sophie, a fashion buyer, said: I believe it was fate that I met Em at -years-old during our first year of secondary school. “If someone had told me  years ago, that one of my best friends would go on to carry my genetic baby I would have laughed. “But all that time has been building up this moment, one I now believe was always meant to be. “We have always had a strong friendship, even after she once ordered four taxis to turn up to my house at am on a school night as a joke. “She has saved us from our immense pain and given us back our hope by offering to be our surrogate.  In , Sophie fell pregnant for the first time - two weeks ahead of Emiliana – sadly an early scan at seven weeks for Sophie revealed an ectopic pregnancy. She said: “It was pretty much what you always dream about - sharing pregnancy and motherhood at the same time as my best friend. But on the day, Em told me she was pregnant too I was experiencing stomach pains. “I was rushed to AE after a scan revealed an ectopic pregnancy - this resulted in tube removal. “It was incredibly scary and emotionally heart-breaking. “It was dficult for both of us to be on very dferent paths to parenthood, but we it never affected our friendship. It had been six years of emotional turmoil for the fashion buyer who never got to hear a heartbeat as she miscarried at six to seven weeks each time. Emiliana would always offer a shoulder to cry on and would be one of the first to find out about Sophie’s heartache. She said: “Em would always come around, even when I didn’t want to talk but she would be there to support us. “It never got any easier and I began to feel like I constantly had a lump permanently in my throat.  “It became so painful to hear someone  get pregnant and to hear that they had seen a heartbeat on a scan. “The envy and jealousy were immense and then the guilt about feeling this way would set in and the vicious circle continued. “But I would still be there as much as I could for friends pregnancies, baby showers and when babies arrived as it was always my priority to not let my infertility affect friendships. “I guessed Em was pregnant with Theo, I had been through five miscarriages, so I was familiar with the signs of somebody not wanting to tell me. “She was pretty quiet and said we need to meet up, so I knew straight away – it is bittersweet because I was happy for her but sad for me. “I became pretty depressed my mental health definitely took a nosee - I felt like I was just surviving le watching everyone  move on and have babies of their own. “ During Emiliana’s second pregnancy, the grieving couple took a career break and spent two months travelling around Australia – on their , Sophie suffered another ectopic pregnancy. She describes it as the ‘nail in the coffin’ as her second fallopian tube was removed.  Although they had never thought about surrogacy before, Emiliana offered whilst pregnant as she wanted to put an end to their pain. Emiliana, who is a hypnobirthing teacher, said: “I thought about being a surrogate for two months before proposing the idea to Sophie as it isn’t the type of thing you can say and go back on. “I wanted to make sure I was serious and that my partner James was happy for me to go ahead with it. “I think him seeing Jack in so much emotional pain over the years has made it an easy decision for him too. “We often say, ‘nine months of our lives for their whole le to change’. “I wrote a letter to Sophie and Jack, so they had it in writing and to show I really meant it.” Four-year-old Mollie and Theo, two, were read a children’s book on surrogacy so they can understand. Sophie adds: “I bought them a book so they can understand as best as they can, Theo is a little too young but Mollie knows the baby isnapost mine.

Gemma Copeland, , was visiting Schoenbrunn Zoo while on holiday in Vienna, Austria, with her -week-old son Jasper and partner Shane, , last Thursday. The trio were close to the orangutan enclosure when Gemma realised Jasper needed to feed. As she sat down against the glass to feed her son, a female orangutan began watching her intently and kissing and putting her hand on the glass. Shane managed to capture the emotional -minute long encounter on his phone. Mum-of-one Gemma, a nail technician from Stockport, Gtr Manchester but now living in Cheshire, said she was left in tears by the incredible display of animal compassion. She said: “I’m mad on travelling and animals and when I booked a cheap flight to Vienna I noticed that they have the oldest zoo in the world. “During our visit, I realised we nearly missed out on seeing the orangutans so we turned around and went back.  “We couldn’t see them in their enclosure so we just said ‘let’s go home’, but I realised that they had come back out when we turned away so we went to go and look. “I went to the window for a closer look and sat down by the window so my son could see the orangutan who was roughly five or six foot away – I didn’t want to frighten her so I made myself smaller so I could take a picture. “She then got up, carried a piece of cloth to the window and sat down with me. “She looked directly into my eyes then placed her hand up asto touch my son. I was in awe of this beautul creature already. “My son wanted feeding and as it was quiet I fed him whilst I sat there. “The way the orangutan reacted took my breath away she kept looking at me, then my son then back again. “She sat with me for approximately half an hour, and kept stroking the glass and lay down next to me asto support and protect me. “I was absolutely gobsmacked and got quite a crowd of people turning up to see what was going on – people were sat watching quietly and respectfully. “It was really lovely and I didn’t want to leave – it felt incredible and I was crying so much because I couldn’t take it in.”  After Gemma shared the heart-warming moment on Facebook for her friends and family to see, it went viral – racking up millions of views, likes and shares. The new mum has since discovered the orangutan, Sol, had previously given birth to a stillborn infant, making the experience even more emotional.

Douglas Lumsden said now the building warrant has been granted, the “intention” would be for that work to start “immediately”.He added: “That might include internal works first which people won’t be able to see.”As well as the removal of the old main arena building, the covered walkway that connects to the section of the conference centre next to the Holiday Inn Express will also be removed.It is expected that the value of the work to be undertaken will be around £,.The warrant has an expiry date of January   and all work must be completed by then.It is understood that the remaining conference centre will be retained as well as the nearby park-and-ride facility.Talks regarding the future use of the site are still ongoing.Plans were previously submitted to the local authority by developers Henry Boot in May  for the land, which hoped to create a mixed use development including approximately  residential units, properties for commercial and business use, a recycling centre and park-and-ride facility.The application is still pending and there was a number of documents uploaded on to the site in , along with a letter of objection received last year.It stated: “The site would have been better used as a new north-east HQ and training hub for Police Scotland with Queen Street being disposed of.“There would be ample space to create a specialist training facility, which Police Scotland does not have anywhere north of the central belt.”Discussions have also been under way with the King’s Community Church over the site, with the church keen to move from its base on King Street.The church began in  with a small gathering before it moved to the city centre church in  where it has remained.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: “A building warrant to demolish the arena at the old AECC and a covered walkway to the adjacent hotel has been approved by the planning authority.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/5e09af70395f92.99313836-137x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"north east politicians welcome news on scottish budget date","story":"Politicians from across the north-east have welcomed progress on the Scottish budget date being set.Criticism was levelled at the UK Government after Chancellor Sajid Javid confirmed the UK Budget would take place on March , the same day that Scottish councils legally have to set local council tax rates.However, Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay announced yesterday he will publish the Scottish Government’s budget on February , allowing councils to arrange their finances on time.He said: “The timing of the UK Budget made it impossible for us to publish our own budget after the UK Government’s without drastically restricting the time for parliamentary scrutiny.“In these exceptional circumstances, created by the UK Government, it is vital we give local authorities and public services clarity on their budgets.“That is why we have made the decision to publish our budget in February which will allow local authorities to set their budgets and council tax before the legal deadline of March .”Aberdeen City Council co-leader Douglas Lumsden said the local authority can now arrange its own date, as initially scheduled, for March . He said: “It’s good that Derek Mackay is setting his budget so we will hopefully have a better understanding of what we’ll receive so we can set ours in March.”Gillian Martin, MSP for Aberdeenshire East, said: “Derek Mackay has done the right thing despite the shameful delay from UK Government.“I’m very pleased with the announcement and I’m sure councils across the country are relieved he has shown this leadership. By failing to produce a budget before March , the Tories have shown a complete disregard for Scotland and our interests.”The UK Treasury previously said “nothing stops” the Scottish Parliament from passing their budget before the UK Government’s but declined to comment yesterday."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/01/EE-CJS-080120-1-12-789x564.jpg ","title":"refurbished statue is back in rightful place in north east town centre","story":"A refurbished statue which looks out across a north-east town centre has been painstakingly ed home.The repaired effigy of Alexander Fraser, the th Lord Saltoun, sat above the door of the council chambers on Fraserburgh’s Saltoun Square since .But the harsh weather took its toll and left the statue without a face. vw, px\"  As part of a near-£ million regeneration scheme in Fraserburgh the figurine was removed, and for the last few months, stone conservator Karolina Allan has been trying to give him a new look.With the work complete, the statue has been hoisted back into its original home, which will now be known as the Faithlie Centre.The former council chamber will be an enterprise centre to help start-up businesses as part of a £.m revamp.Specialist teams were in Fraserburgh yesterday to supervise the heavy stone statue being lted into place.Banff and Buchan area committee vice-chairman Mike Roy said it was “exciting” the effiguy had been ed to its “rightful place”.He added: “Karolina’s excellent work has transformed the statue and is a great symbol of the detailed work and traditional skills being used bring this historic building back into use.“We are all very much looking forward to the Faithlie Centre becoming a hub of local activity once again.” vw, px\"  Brian Topping, chairman of the Fraserburgh Regeneration Development Partnership, said he was pleased to see progress on part of the major project for the town was moving forward.He said: “Bringing the Faithlie Centre back into use is a major part of the regeneration work currently taking place in Fraserburgh, and I am sure everybody will pleased to see Lord Saltoun overlooking the square once again.“The investment in the town will bring new and improved opportunities for Aberdeenshire Council, our partners and the public and this marks a great start for the year ahead.”Alexander Fraser was known as the “Waterloo Saltoun” after fighting in the Napoleonic Wars.The statue was created by London-based sculptor Edward Stephen and arrived in , six years after Lord Saltoun died."},{"url":null,"title":"meet rg mowat owner of the fulmar","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAt the end of November we asked readers for help to unravel the mystery of a yacht log book which was posted to the paper with no clues as to its origin.And, not for the first time, Argyllshire Advertiser readers have come up trumps and we now know a little more about the boat#s owner, named only as RG Mowat in the log book.The  log book gives an account of the voyages of the -foot gaff cutter #Fulmar# and the adventures of her colourful crew. Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

It now seems that Dutch taxpayers are subsidising our failing train services. This is on top of the Scottish Government subsidies, which make up about half of its pound billion revenues.We need a viable solution to ScotRailrsquos woes, and terminating franchises early or nationalisation is not the answer.

Encouraging rural tourism is at the top of my list, and I believe the Scottish Government need to make it a priority to ensure that our overcrowded capital does not suffer, when rural areas have a more peaceful and less stressful visitor experience on offer."},{"url":null,"title":"polar-bear-expert-deliver-talk-galashiels","story":"THE Arctic is ground-zero for climate change, and polar bears are on the front line.Yet, therersquos still a whole lot to learn about these magnicent animals.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the latest in a series of important milestones that have brought us a step closer to progressing plans for sustainable economic development."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-test-rocket-engines-former-cockenzie-power-station-site-rejected","story":"Skyrorarsquos bid to set up a base on where the sitersquos former coal handling plant stood had caused a ision between neighbouring community councils and saw nearly  objections lodged with East Lothian Council.And at a meeting of the local authorityrsquos planning committee last Wednesday, the proposal was rejected against the advice of council officials after planning convenor Councillor Norman Hampshire branded the development a ldquobad neighbour.Mr Hampshire told fellow committee members that he was concerned that allowing Skyrora to test rocket engines on the land, which is central to the councilrsquos future economic plans, could put other investors off.He said: ldquoThis is not a good neighbour ndash it is a bad neighbour development and my concern is this may deter potential investors from taking on development at the Cockenzie site.Skyrora had lodged an application to create a rocket engine testing site on the land, which is owned by the local authority, with plans to carry out five -second tests each month.But while it applied for temporary use of the site for five years, Skyrora told the planning committee that it envisaged the possibility of not just expanding its presence in the community but potentially bringing a manufacturing facility, described as the size of an Ikea store, to the area.And while Prestonpans Community Council supported the move as offering potential for jobs and the economy, neighbouring Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council objected.At the planning committee meeting last week, Bryan Hickman, chairman of Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council, recalled a public meeting in the summer which attracted several hundred people.He said: ldquoVirtually everyone who was there was against it ndash ranging from our youngest residents to pensioners.ldquoThe feeling, rightly or wrongly, in the community is that they do not want it.During the council meeting, residents raised concerns about the storage of key elements of fuel on the site for days prior to testing, as well as the impact of burning kerosene into the atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision.

He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in

Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

It was brilliant public relations for the royal family. I found myself indulging in a new respect for Her Majesty herself,not the institution.Mrs Windsor has done a pretty good job in her six-and-a-bit decades on the throne, not just representing Britain but negotiating the dismantling of the British Empire in the s and s. Say what you like about Britainrsquos colonial past, but nothing became the Empire so much as the ending of it.She had the wisdom to realise, in the s, that to make the monarchy relevant, and justy the prodigious amounts of public money spent on its upkeep, there had to be a quid pro quo.The ldquoFirm, as she calls it, had to be seen to be ldquogiving something back through intense charitable activity and the grind of diplomatic intercourse. And, of course, simply ldquobeing there for the opening of bridges and hospitals, and for moments of national tragedy, like Aberfan.But the Queen is a product of a bygone age of deference, of patronage, of noblesse oblige. She embodies the virtues of duty, hard work and responsibility that defined the post-war ruling classes.These are anachronistic qualities in the age of celebrity. We now have an alternative royalty in the form of internet stars like the Kardashians, and Beyonce. This world has long held a fatal attraction to minor members of the royal brood, who aspire to the elite lestyle while lacking the means.Such has been the rather tawdry fate of Harry and Meghan. Megxit, and the disintegration of the Sussexesrsquo public image, would make a whole season of The Crown. Their departure from ldquosenior royal le has absolutely nothing to do with duty and everything to do with worldly aice.They clearly want to remain in the public eye, their celebrity wedding guest list confirmed that. They believe they can make a lot of money as influencers and sponsors. But they have found the duties and responsibilities of being part of the royal family uncongenial.In the words of Queen ndash the pop group that is ndash they want to break free. To which the British public says: fine. Do what you gotta to do. Polls show that the British public wish the Sussexes well in their new le.However, the deal is thatthey want to escape the paparazzi and the responsibilities of royalty, they must also give up its privileges. They must give up their royal titles and stop consuming vast amounts of public money.The renovation of their grace-and-favour home, Frogmore Cottage, cost the taxpayer pound. million. Their security costs around pound, a year. They receive millions from the revenues of royal estates, via Harryrsquos dad, Prince Charles.The financial taps should be turned off. There is no need, since Harryrsquos personal fortune is estimated at poundm and Meghan is also wealthy. To most of us this seems self-evident. And yoursquod expect Labour to be calling them out most loudly.The default position of the left used to be contempt for the flummery and waste of the royal family. They consume millions of pounds of public money that could be better used for foodbanks. The monarchy is regarded, rightly, as a feudal anachronism, the apex of privilege.But some Labour MPs, especially BAME ones, like Clive Lewis, seem to regard the Sussexes as a special kind of royalty. Far from condemning the behaviour of these soon-to-be ex-royals, theyrsquove been leaping to their defence. Meghan Markle is being portrayed as a victim rather than a social parasite. A victim of a racist media and a bigoted society.In a furious piece in the New York Times,columnist Afua Hirsch blamed deeply ingrained British racism for Meghanrsquos decision to ditch the Firm. ldquoHer treatment, she wrote, ldquohas proved what many of us have always known ... in this society racism will still follow you.Social media is fizzing with indignation at the allegedly racist treatment of Meghan. Oprah Winfrey has been fanning the flames across the pond. Racism has driven poor Meghan to seek refuge in Toronto.There is actually very little evidence of racism in the media treatment of Markle. The oft-quoted headline, ldquoshe was nearly straight out of Compton, may have been silly and wrong, but it wasnrsquot racist. The social and family background of a new member of the royal family is a legitimate matter of public interest.The instant sacking of disc jockey Danny Baker after his ldquomonkey tweet shows just how intolerant of racism the UK media has become. Criticism of Harry and Meghanrsquos hypocrisy in lecturing on the environment while relying on private jets is not racist.In the Sussexesrsquo resignation epistle there is no mention of racism. They clearly donrsquot like their treatment by the press. But their court actions against the media are about phone hacking and , not race.Meghan Markle was lionised by the press when she arrived on the scene three years ago. The media was fascinated and enchanted by this woke princess who was bringing the stuffy royal family into the st century.The coverage in all newspapers was little short of adulatory. Her feminism was widely praised she adorned the front page of Vogue her wedding had the full -inside-pages treatment.Meghanrsquos arrival was seen as a signicant moment in the progress towards equality and ersity in Britain. Her departure comes as a blow to minority groups which saw her as a torch-bearer for anti-racism and anti-sexism. As a royal she had a unique  now she is just another self-obsessed celebrity.And the royalsrsquo behaviour following the Epstein scandal is a serious blow to The Firm. It is clear that the monarchy, as it stands, is no longer viable. It will have to downsize to immunise itself from scandals like this in future.Questions about the anachronistic constitutional role of the Queen can no longer be avoided.She is head of state, a formal role of course, but one that nearly became highly political during the Brexit crisis last year. There was a real possibility that the Queen might have had to decide whether or not to endorse a caretaker prime minister.This monarch should be the last to have any formal role in the constitution. The Crown should no longer be seen as above politics. The hereditary principle should play no part in our democracy.It goes without saying that therersquos no place for royalty in Scotland. The Scottish National Party needs to reassess its historical support for the Queen. Alex Salmond called her the ldquoQueen of Scots, and the  White Paper envisaged a role for the monarch in Scotland after independence. This is surely no longer tenable.If Scotland is to become independent, there should be no question of a hereditary head of state. And there is surely no place for celebrity airheads like the Sussexes."},{"url":null,"title":"group-bbc-one-scotland-review","story":"DREAM big or go home seems to have been the guiding force behind Group, the latest sitcom pilot for BBC Scotland.

This is no sitcom train wreck, like last weekrsquos offering, The Scotts.The problem with Group is it lacks laughs. There are moments when you will smile, particularly at the passive-aggressiveness of some of the female characters , but laugh out loud moments come there none.Some might say this doesnrsquot matter too much in a pilot, where the priority is to draw the viewers in just enough to make them watch again.

We are bringing the story full circle.Amentotaxus argotaenia is classed as ldquonear endangered globally and is very rare in Hong Kong. Craig Williams, senior curator at the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden in Kowloon, was worried about the prospects of any remaining wild plants, which could also be threatened by the recent arrival in Hong Kong of the day flying moth Milionia zonea, whose larvae feed on the leaves of some trees.Two years ago, he discovered that Edinburgh was home to a living specimen, which originated from Hong Kongrsquos highest peak, Tai Mo Shan.Some  rooted cuttings were propagated over  months in Edinburgh before being carefully transported to Hong Kong in an attempt to boost the population.Mr Gardner said: ldquoThis is the first time we have ever done this. More than  years ago, botanic gardens really werenrsquot centres for conservation.ldquoBecause of the bioersity crisis, botanic gardens like Edinburgh have become storage centres for genetic material. We have to be poised, ready tomaterial whenever it is needed.ldquoAll we had was material taken from one tree that was here, but now they have  rooted cuttings that they are going to grow on and plant out. These will help to save the population in Hong Kong.ldquoWith a larger population they have a better chance of survival.Mr Williams said the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden would celebrate the remarkable story, adding: ldquoAmentotaxus argotaenia is a protected species here and it is of immense value to us to have rooted material from the Edinburgh accession. We aim to provide interpretation alongside a few specimens in our public display areas to explain the story of their amazing journey from one tree in Edinburgh.Gunter Fisher, Kadooriersquos head of flora conservation, added: ldquoThis is a great example of a shared vision for the conservation of rare plants and shows how botanic gardens can collaborate to put their living collections to constructive and practical use in global efforts.The news comes as the Royal Botanic Garden prepares a year-long programme of events to mark its th anniversary. The theme will be climate change and bioersity loss and highlights include an expedition to Papua New Guinea in August, a birthday party for the public in June and a gala concert in October.The four-week Papua New Guinea trip will aim to discover and record new species of plants and insects, and monitor bioersity by using next-generation DNA sequencing.It will work in collaboration with the Papua New Guinea Forest Research Institute and the National Museum of Scotland, Other events include the opening in June of the Garden of Tranquillity for visitors with dementia.There will also be a debate on Halting Plant Extinction on  November.

The party is incapable of putting a foot right. In fact, when it tries to put a foot right, its giant clown shoes step on a rake that hits it in the face.Labour has been in chaos since it got thumped senseless by voters at the General Election. The shenanigans over what to do about independence have been a popcorn-gobbling sight to behold.Some members want a second referendum, some donrsquot. Some like federalism, some donrsquot.Some think independence is inevitable, some would rather get all Johnsonian and die in a ditch than yield to the evil Nats.In an attempt to sort this absolute parody of a sham of a farce out, leader Richard Leonard planned a special conference on the constitution, to consider whether the party should back Indyref, with federalism maybe a third option on the ballot.That sounded a good idea. Have a debate, settle on a position ndash stick to it. Voters like that kind of thing. But no, thatrsquos way too easy for Labour. Too painless. Better to collectively clamber naked into a bag of razor blades and jump around.The partyrsquos Scottish Executive Committee rejected Leonardrsquos idea. Instead, the party will now have an ldquoaway day to discuss the constitution. An ldquoaway day. Are we in a Carry On film  Carry on Incompetent  The headlines were inevitable. It was ldquoutterly humiliating. A ldquocomplete mess.Scottish Labour is disintegrating before our eyes. This is the partyrsquos twilight.Labour cannot cope with the constitutional demands of the st century. Brexit and Scottish independence are killing it.The problem with Labour is Labour. The party of today is in love with the idea of itself, with the history of the party. Itrsquos astherersquos a shrine to Keir Hardiersquos flat-cap where all members must genuflect. The only problem is: the public couldnrsquot care less about Labour traditions and purity. Things changed years ago, Labour just hasnrsquot caught up.It all seems funny, but in truth itrsquos tragic. Scotland needs a ing Labour Party ndash any democracy needs a strong voice from the left. The SNP dresses in progressive clothes, but itrsquos really just been stealing for years now from what was once Labourrsquos wardrobe. Scottish democracy would be much more robustthere were an authentic left-wing party standing up for ordinary people. So what are Labourrsquos options  You can game the strategies ndash but none of them look good for Labour.First, the party can stick with the position it has on the constitution. The problem is, though, that most of the public will say, ldquowhat is that position . One minute Labour seems to be moving towards support for Indyref, or devo max, and the next itrsquos walking everything backwards.Also, voters kicked Labour so hard in the head on its present position at the election that the party is now effectively wearing its face upside down. Labour lost six out of seven MPs and came third behind the Tories on . per cent of the vote.What about federalism or devo max  This is such a sad debate for Labour to have ndash because itrsquos pointless and it will not save them, yet many in the party seem to think of federalism as the leboat which will carry them to safety.Before Brexit, some form of federalism may have been an option, but not now. Surely even Labour can see that  How will federalism appeal to voters who care about the EU  It will not retain their EU citizenship. It wonrsquot appeal to Yes voters, as they want independence. Federalism wonrsquot appeal to Remain voters as they want back in the EU.Federalism is an escape tunnel with an armed guard waiting at the end of it.Nor will the mechanics of federalism work. In a federal UK all voices would need to be equal ndash thatrsquos the point. However, England has a population of  million, Scotland . million.Unless federalism involves England being balkanised into a series of regions ndash Yorkshire, Cornwall, the Midlands ndash with roughly equivalent populations, it will be entirely undemocratic and unfair. Why would England agree to that  No-onersquos even asked the English.So, should Labour adopt a neutral position on independence  Drop opposition to it, but donrsquot campaign as a party for it ndash allow members a free vote on independence. It sounds nice, but we need only remember the partyrsquos position on Brexit at the election.Trying to play both sides may sound super-smart and slippery, but the electorate doesnrsquot buy it.What about going full ultra-unionist  Well, Labour tried that in  and that was the start of its terminal decline. Former Deputy Leader Alex Rowley, also constitution spokesman, tweeted that too many Labour apparatchiks still feel Better Together and ldquostanding alongside the Tories is the best way forward. If a voter wants unionism, theyrsquove got the Conservatives.Whatrsquos left  The remaining option is to back independence. Every other path is closed off. Could it work  Could the party reconfigure itself, setting out a leftwing case for independence ndash taking the nationalism out of the Yes movement  Might that bring back progressives who left Labour for the SNP  Therersquos plenty of such voters out there who arenrsquot natural SNP supporters.Some Labour figures see the writing on the wall. Ben Bradshaw MP, who was in government with Blair and Brown, says hersquos ldquo% certain Scotland will become independent.MSP Monica Lennon thinks the Scottish party should split from the UK party. The idea is hard to fault.Of course, backing independence could immediately cause Labour to implode. Members might flee, senior figures quit. Would voters be drawn from the SNP to Labour  Itrsquos unlikely.

Off we went, actors in fur CGI creeping and crawling through the streets of London, their digitally enhanced ears twitching as they moved through the Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats.Nothing grating so far.This, in fact, was a delight. Even the dancing cockroaches had a certain charm. Yes, at points seeing Judi Dench with a lionesque ring of long fur framing her face felt a little fever-dreamish but she pulled it off with a certain twinkling gravitas.What are the complaints  Viewers twisted their knickers over scale - in some parts the cats are as big as cutlery in other parts they fill window frames.Two women in my screening couldnt move past the fact that Jennyanydots unzips her own skin to reveal a new outfit underneath.

Remember that we were told in  that the only way to stay in the EU was to vote no.Mr Smith apparently felt so bad during the brief few yards when the march passed the handful of counter-demonstrators that he wished he wasnrsquot there. My experience during this very brief stage of the march was one of humour.The conclusion of the article ndash aside from his comical and ironic wrestle with the wet Saltire near the end of the march ndash that the same people doing the same thing will achieve nothing ignores the fact that these marches are part of a series of events that have been, and will be, held all over Scotland in order to ensure that the public profile of the issue of Scottish independence is maintained. Some, but not by any means all, who attended in Glasgow will have taken part in a similar march in their local area. It also ignores the fact that no change has ever been achieved by those people who are looking for change sitting back and doing nothing.Allistair Matheson, Selkirk.LIKE Mark Smith I too was at the independence march in Glasgow on Saturday and like him it was my first such march, so I was interested to read of his experiences.Throughout the march I recognised Mr Smiths accounts of what he saw and heard, so I must have been near him throughout the march, though our interpretations dfered not signicantly but subtly, but that is a moot point depending on onersquos perspective.I therefore would like to put my slant on what he saw and heard and give one or two additions. I met people from all over the UK, not just from Aberdeen. I was surprised that as a journalist he didnrsquot speak to more people. There were people from Wales who were very noticeable as they were speaking Welsh, a contingent of \"From England for Yes\" waving the St Georges Cross, and people from Inverness and Orkney.I agree on the age dferential but was inclined not to put a political slant on it as Mr Smith did I take a more pragmatic view. As a pensioner myself who has led a busy working le it is unlikely that in my middle age I would have had the time to devote myself to marching at a weekend. That is normally done by students and older people who have the time to do these sort of things. I do not think one can take anything other than that from the age distribution. The march was lined by a lot of middle-aged people who had come out of shops and offices.I also was disturbed by the sight of an alternative group cordoned off by the police and supervisors and thought this might spell trouble. On two points I disagree with Mr Smith. There were certainly a lot of Union Flags being waved, as the photo accompanying the article showed, but in fact I estimated about  people waving them. Mr Smith mentioned one lady shouting \"Scotland\". So that was one person out of thousands that he seems to have hyped into an outrage against democracy. Indeed, the vitriol came the other way. Everyone around me waved and smiled to the Unionists and as far as I can tell this continued till I was well out of sight of them.On most other points I agree with Mr Smith that it wasnrsquot a rowdy, noisy march and I too was surprised about the anti-Tory chants and would have preferredthey had kept to the topic of the march.I enjoyed the march thoroughly and met some really great people and yes, they did have similar views to me. but isnrsquot that what the march was about Ronnie Scott, Croy, Inverness-shire.IT was good to see Mark Smith dip his toe in the chilly waters of an All Under One Bannerindependence march. Im sure he was as drookit as the rest of us last weekend. I read his comments and agreed with some, but would have to take issue with others.Anti-Tory sloganising in some parts of the march, yes this was true and although the general advice was that there should be no coarse or negative language, that was there among us. The march was called to protest about the Johnson Government and there were banners that I would not have supported, but it is a public event and we generally dont have the banner police sorting us out.Where he seemed rather po-faced was in the failure to describe the joyous atmosphere that attends such events. And despite his comments, many families are happy to bring their children, knowing that they will have fun and be part of a great democratic carnival.His comments about the marchers being the same , people turning up and offering each other mutual support are not accurate. The first Glasgow AUOB march I attended a couple of years ago had about , people and we were pretty pleased to have that number. In my section of the march we had two new folk who joined us and two or three promised who didnt come because of the rain. AUOB has also made the wise decision to go to venues where demonstrations dont happen much and areas where people voted no. This allows local people to see the strength of feeling for independence which is never reflected in the media, with the exception of The Herald and the National.There is a huge buzz within the independence movement which never finds itself reflected in the popular press or television with the above exceptions.People are meeting and talking about a new currency and a new type of economy without the domination of casino banking. There are meetings about how we work on a new green economy which is driven by environmental and societal benefits, not greed. Many new ideas about taxation and tackling poverty are being talked about in village halls and town centres ndash not the \"narrow nationalism\" and \"separatism\" promoted by the popular press.Mr Smith is to be commended for his venture into this great popular democratic movement and I hope he will think about coming again.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow G.CREDIT to Mark Smith, first, for venturing forth on a foul January day apparently with his heid bereft of any protection. It seems that as the march progressed it was not only the weather but the language of some that deteriorated to unacceptable levels. \"Maggie, Maggie hellip deid\" or \" Tories, Tories hellip out\" hardly enhanced proceedings. Surely any gathering should realise there are ious shades of political persuasion present. Tolerance and respect to others must be a basic principle.The absurdity of such chants coupled with obscene shouts by zealots obsessed by the \"cause\" counteracts any public sympathy. Perhaps Mr Smiths closing sentiments on becoming unwillingly wrapped in a sodden flag illustrates the dangers of dissuading a potential supporter.Allan C Steele, Gfnock.SITTING at a window seat in a pub in Glasgow city centre, three of us attempted to count the marchers at the independence march.

Because of the irregular shape of the group the density of the ranks of marchers fluctuated like a concertina and it was dficult to gauge precise numbers at times there was as few as  per minute, and up to  per minute passing our stationary position. The pace of the marchers was determined by police, traffic lights and photo shoots which meant it moved slowly at about   .mph and stopped frequently, causing it to congest.There were several small groups of supporters lined along the route which would help swell the numbers overall. Even taking this into account the most congested parts of the march meant no more than , could have taken part at its height. Claims of , to , are wildly inaccurate, this would have meant approximately , marchers per minute passing a fixed point continuously for  minutes. This did not happen. Given the sedentary pace and loose formation of the marchers a figure of , would be a generous estimate.These marches are fast losing their signicance and now only represent a vocerous minority of Scots.Allan Thompson, Bearsden.THE nationalistsrsquo pointless marching season has begun again. The motley crowd of about ,waved banners many of which were liberally sprinkled with the \"f\" word, and worse, the \"c\" word. Decent people donrsquot use these words and certainly donrsquot expect to see them printed on large banners whilst shopping on a wet Saturday afternoon.Decency has deserted these desperate nationalists. They are not going to be allowed another referendum and they know it. By all means let them state their case and marchthey must, though itrsquos a terrible waste of time and police manpower.If they really want to encourage others to their hopeless cause, then perhaps they should clean up their act, quit the filthy language and stop dressing up like extras from Brigadoon.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the days before devolution, it was often the last line of defence against attacks on local communities waged by Tory governments. But it was also an arena for innovation and local initiative. Some ideas pioneered at council level found their way on to the national stage in housing and transport, in equalities, education and even economic development. And they still do.So I agree with Alison Evison, the president of our councils’ umbrella body Cosla, when she said this week that we are talking of “the sphere of government closest to Scotland’s citizens”.And of course, her comments about local government’s importance come not in the abstract, but as context to a stern real-world warning. Ahead of the Scottish Government’s budget, she noted that “whichever way you want to dress it up, the reality is that in recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out”.: SNP plans mean ‘more austerity than under the Tories’, says IFS: Brexit means Scotland now ‘likely’ to vote for independence, says Labour MPIt’s not just her view – or mine. Fteen months ago, the Accounts Commission concluded that “funding for local government from the Scottish Government decreased at a faster rate, . per cent, than the Scottish Government revenue budget at . per cent”. In other words, for all their attempts to blame the Tories – who it is true have decimated local government in England – for the failed experiment of austerity, SNP ministers in Edinburgh have quadrupled the cuts that were handed down to them.Passing the buckBut how could any Scottish government get away with this  From schools to home care, from libraries to bin collections – with the possible exception of the NHS, this is where most of Scotland’s people interact with government and the public sector. Councils and councillors are also citizens’ first port of call when things go wrong – from the heating in rented flats to elderly relatives left in the lurch without a care plan. Surely it would be politically toxic to take the axe to council budgets in exactly the way the SNP has done Unfortunately, ministers have cynically deployed the very fact that local government is closer to Scotland’s citizens in order to shirk responsibility. So when I challenged Nicola Sturgeon over failing care services in South Lanarkshire at First Minister’s Questions last week, she was happy to pass the buck to the SNP-controlled council. And by proxy, she passed the buck to ordinary citizens, who will feel a closer affinity to councils and the services they provide than they do to national governments. While many people consider there to be a direct link between the council tax levied on their homes and the services which they receive, council tax accounted for only £. billion of local government revenue in -. Non-domestic rates accounted for £. billion, but the majority – £. billion – came from the General Revenue Fund allocated by the Scottish Government.And there have been consequences as a result of the SNP Government’s approach.Rising demand for servicesIn , Scotland’s councils held assets valued at £. billion. But rather than a reassurance, we should take this as a warning. These possessions range from single-occupancy flats, to pension fund investments, to architectural gems held in trust for the public they were built to serve. They are each attached to signicant costs or debts. And as councils struggle with rising demand for services such as home care, alongside falling budgets, the cost demand of servicing these assets and the potential sale revenues will make it more and more alluring for councils to be tempted to dispose of them.It is often cultural services which suffer first:  public libraries closed their doors altogether in Scotland in  alone. Many others have seen their hours cut. We are now reaching the point, however, that even statutory services like home care find themselves truly at breaking point. In the past three years,  of Scotland’s  councils have been forced to draw down from their reserves. As a result, councils now hold £ million less in reserves than they did just a year ago.Central Government ministers have set targets and commitments for local government, which could be an effective means of improving services. But without giving councils the financial resources they need to meet these, it becomes simply an effective means of shting the blame for austerity.Devolution of powerSo ahead of the Scottish budget on March , Scottish Labour is calling on the SNP Government to ditch the easy blame games and take some responsibility. Just because there is greater local accountability for local government services, it doesn’t mean central Government can abdicate responsibility for a deliberate choice to underfund them.But we won’t stop there. Over a decade after the SNP promised to abolish the council tax, local government increasingly finds itself under central control: including over the setting of council tax. That’s why I want the principle of subsidiarity – the devolution of power as close as possible to the grass roots – to form part of Scottish Labour’s offer on constitutional reform. A particular challenge is now facing us. With the onset of Brexit, the powers which currently lie with the European Union will be repatriated. The question is where to. They cannot be concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. They must be devolved. But the strengthening of local government must be part of that.Local government, unfashionable a cause as it may be, will be the bedrock of a more democratic future for Scotland. It should be about bread but it should be about roses as well: theatres and swimming pools as well as roads and bin collections. It is a means to establishing a better, more empowered and more enriched quality of le for our citizens.It is critical to inspiring renewed confidence and rekindled hope in every community across Scotland.But that can’t be done on the cheap. So let’s remind the Scottish Government that now is the time for fair funding for Scotland’s local council services.Richard Leonard is Scottish Labour leader and an MSP for Central Scotland©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"dire state of scottish labour revealed in leaked report","story":"A damning leaked report on the state of Scottish Labour, has lain out the scale of the partys problems as it looks to regroup in the wake of near wipe-out at the General Election.A progress report, part of review of the internal structures of the party being carried out by Lesley Laird, who until December was Shadow Scottish Secretary and deputy of Scottish Labour until losing her seat, has said there is an \"urgent need to make some tough choices\"the party is to \"move the dial\" on its political ambitions.The report, which was commissioned by Labours Scottish Executive Committee at the end of  - before the party saw its vote share collapse to . per cent in last years European elections, and thenjust one MP to Westminster last month - exposes the dire financial straits of the party, as well as a lack of a plan to resolve the situation.: Lesley Laird takes swipe at party in stepping down as Scottish Labour deputy leaderIt states there is \"no detailed financial or business plan\" for Scottish Labour, that there is \"no membership strategy\", that fundraising is \"limited and not aligned to strategy, business plan or political objectives\", internal structures are \"dislocated\" and staff are \"frustrated and demotivated\" as a result of undermining actions by elected politicians.Overall, it says theres \"simply not enough oversight, governance and hands on working by SEC members with the party officers and political leaders in core areas\", which has \"contributed to high levels of frustration and ultimately a break down in their ability to provide the level of governance needed on key aspects of the party’s operations in Scotland.”The progress report was presented to the SEC at the same Saturday meeting which saw the party leader Richard Leonard have his proposal for a conference on the partys approach to a second independence referendum defeated.It also criticises the party for failing to implement the recommendations of previous internal reviews, dating back to , and emphasises a need for the whole organisation to become more \"professional\", putting that task in the hands of the new Scottish General Secretary Michael Sharpe.Morale is a big problem, the report says, with staff feeling \"frustrated and demotivated when elected representatives through their words and actions undermine the huge amount of work and effort they are making to deliver for our party.: Labour appoint English MP as shadow Scotland Secretary\"We also do not make the best use of our resources and hiring has been done at times in what feels like a siloed approach. There are opportunities to improve reach and ersication of our recruitment and selection procedures. The new General Secretary should undertake a review of all roles and responsibilities aligned to Scotland. They should be mapped against the strategic and political objectives, and where required changes should be implemented.\"The partys communications are also criticised, with the lack of an \"integrated communications plan joining up print, digital, social media.\" The report states: Politically the landscape has fundamentally changed, and we have failed to come to terms with it and adjust or mody the way we do things.\"Many of these fundamental issuescontribute to our ability to articulate our core policy messages and to carry them effectively into communities and the media. An integrated communications plan is required to be developed that takes account the changed political landscape and the rise in social and digital media.\" The report also recommends hiring a full-time fundraiser immediately, noting: “The current UK model provides a successful template for how this position can be financed and results delivered.”it also recommends looking at moving party headquarters from Glasgow to Edinburgh to be closer to the Scottish Parliament.The party said the document was not the final Laird review report and was still “subject to change” as the review was ongoing, though was expected to be completed shortly.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"strike action looms at sullom voe ","story":"Industrial action could soon be on the cards at Sullom Voe Terminal after union Unite announced it will ballot its members.This follows talks with EnQuest on terms and conditions, including pensions.In a consultative ballot held over the festive period,  per cent of Unite members voted to reject EnQuest’s proposed changes to terms and conditions on a  per cent turnout.Unite launched the ballot to coincide with the end of a y internal dispute process involving the union and the company, which has produced no agreement.John Clark, Unite regional industrial officer, said: #Unite will now move forward with an industrial action ballot at Sullom Voe which we have received a resounding mandate for from our membership.

While it is widely accepted that modernisation of air traffic control infrastructure is needed across the region, Ms Wishart says Hial’s own consultants have acknowledged that the ‘remote tower’ model was the most ‘costly’ and ‘risky’ of the options available.The Liberal Democrat MSP has now lodged a motion in parliament that will see a debate on the issue take place later this month.“It now appears clear that Hial’s management is intent on pressing ahead with their plans to centralise air traffic control services.#This is deeply worrying given the serious questions that still hang over these proposals and the level of concern amongst ATC staff.“Hial has been intent on pursuing this option from the outset, despite its own consultants identying the ‘remote tower’ model as the most costly and risky option. Since then, there has been a desperate attempt to get the evidence to fit the desired outcome.“That is simply not acceptable, particularly given the leline nature of these air services. No-one disputes the need to modernise and invest in the current infrastructure. However, this must be balanced with the safety of passengers, reliability of services and the benefits of sustaining high-skilled jobs in our island communities.“To date, the Scottish government has been happy to wave through Hial’s proposals with little evidence of robust scrutiny. I hope this debate will force the Transport Minister to think again and begin asking serious questions about these latest centralisation plans.”Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston has added his voice to calls for a debate in Parliament on HIAL’s plans to centralise air traffic control in the region.Mr Halcro Johnston, an Orkney resident and regular user of Hial services, said: “I share the concern of many people over Hial’s plans to centralise air traffic control services in Inverness.“There is real concern amongst Hial employees that they don’t feel that they have been properly consulted, particularly amongst those living in the islands. Hial should reflect on the feedback they are receiving and review their options before they commit to the approach they are advocating.“I am yet to be convinced that these proposals from Hial aren’t more about saving money than providing a better service. Given how important our vital leline air-links are, that would focusing on the wrong priority from Hial. “I would welcome the opportunity to see the issue debated at Holyrood and, with Hial entirely owned by the Scottish government, to hear the Minister’s justication for Hial’s plans.# It is understood that Hial is planning to update staff and stakeholders on the air traffic controllers issue later this week. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"energy saving campaign focuses on electric heating ","story":"This year the campaign will attempt to reach two groups of people: those who use electric heating and those who have homes that are hard to heat.As part of a national campaign the bureau will hold two community events.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing. I am still weak but you can imagine what it is going to do for me when I fully recover.“I want to thank so many people, including my amazing CF team at Belfast City Hospital who pushed behind the scenes without me knowing, and the amazing staff on Level  South Transplant Ward who have become my second family. I have spent more time with them this year than my own family.“Then there is the team in ICU. What these guys do is amazing.

As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

Gordon Lyonsand Declan Kearneywill serve as junior ministers.Alliance leader Naomi Long accepted the position of justice minister.Members of the executiveThe other members of the executive are: Minister for the economy: Diane Dodds , Minister for education: Peter Weir , Minister for agriculture, environment and rural affairs: Edwin Poots , Minister for communities: Deirdre Hargey , Minister for finance: Conor Murphy , Minister for health: Robin Swann , Minister for infrastructure: Nichola Mallon .DferencesAddressing the assembly, Mrs Foster said the politicians have many dferences.Michelles narrative of the past  years could not be more dferent to mine, she said.Im not sure we will ever agree on much about the past, but we can agree there was too much suffering, and that we cannot allow society to drt backwards and allow ision to grow.Commitment to powerMichelle ONeill said it was her sincere wish that  brings real change.I see no contradiction in declaring and delivering on our firm commitment to power sharing with unionism in the Stormont Assembly while also initiating a mature and inclusive debate about new political arrangements which examine Irelands future beyond Brexit.Similarly, there is no contradiction in unionism working the existing constitutional arrangements while taking its rightful place in the conversation about what a new Ireland would look like.”‘Wonderful compromise’Visiting Belfast on Monday, Boris Johnson hailed the wonderful compromise that has seen theof devolution to Northern Ireland, after meeting Stormonts newly-appointed leaders in Belfast.The prime minister said Stormont was open for business again in the wake of the restoration of power-sharing following three years of political deadlock.Mr Johnson praised politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland, saying they had put aside their dferences, stepped up to the plate and showed leadership.I just want to say how grateful I am to all the parties, to everybody here in Northern Ireland, for the way they have compromised the way they have worked together to get Stormont up and running once again, he said.Its shown a willingness to trust each other and to set aside dferences and I think its absolutely commendable and wonderful to see.Never mind the hand of history on my shoulder... I see the hand of the future beckoning us all forward.And I hope that with goodwill and compromise and hard work on all sides it will be a very bright future indeed.The British government made a number of financial promises to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line.Major investmentNorthern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith promised major investment to tackle problems in Northern Irelands struggling public services, but declined to confirm the sums involved until devolution was restored.Ministers at Stormont are now keen to nail down precise figures.There are reports the government could announce a poundbn package, but a Downing Street source has described this figure as just speculation.And Mr Johnson himself did not answer when asked by journalists about the poundbn figure.Additionally, the Irish government made financial pledges within the agreement to honour commitments to part-fund some north south projects, such as the A dual carriageway and a redevelopment of the Ulster canal system.‘Critical reforms’Speaking ahead of the discussions, Mr Johnson said they will focus on how the executive intended to take forward critical reforms to public services.This is an historic time for the people of Northern Ireland, he said.After three years, Stormont is open for business again with an executive who can now move forward with improving peoples lives and delivering for all communities in Northern Ireland.The previous DUP Sinn Fein-led coalition government collapsed in acrimony in January .The cause was a row about a botched green energy scheme, a dispute that later widened to include more traditional wrangles on issues like the Irish language and the legacy of the Troubles.Mr Johnson said in his news conference that there could be no repetition of the scandal.It is vital that public spending in Northern Ireland is properly invigilated and there is no repetition of that kind of thing, he said.The prime minister added that the new agreement contained provision for proper responsibility for the use of public funds. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’ve consistently said that we have to strengthen our squad and we have to have a high level of performance throughout the coming season, and we are very much in the market looking for players. We have a lot of targets and as I said last season we certainly won’t be bringing players to the club who we haven’t done our homework on. “You’ll see a bit of action at this club over the coming days. At the same time Junior Ogedi came to this club five days before the start of the season last year. We had players in on trial at this time last year and they didn’t fit the bill but that’s just the nature of it. “The league is quite quiet at the minute and you only have to look at Dundalk who have only signed two players, but let’s not forget we have Walter Figueira here, we have Conor Clford, Connor McCormack and we have signed someone from Sheffield United so let’s not underestimate the work that has been done. We are fully aware that we have to bring in a high level of player and we will do that, there’s no doubt about that.” googletag.cmd.push QualityCity kick off their new season with a trip to champions Dundalk on February , and Devine believes that the entire Premier Division this season is as strongest as it has ever been.“This is the toughest I’ve seen the league in a number of years,” he stated. “You only have to look at Shelbourne coming up to replace UCD and I think St. Pat’s are going to invest in their new manager quite heavily. You have Bohemians who have signed  players, Shamrock Rovers who have six full internationals and Dundalk who are hoping to break into the group stages of the Champions League. “We can’t underestimate anyone, and looking at ourselves we also have to strive to get better and make sure that the fundamentals that were part of our plan last year stay the same. We are under no illusions that we will have to work extremely hard because that’s in our DNA.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I’ve consistently said that we have to strengthen our squad and we have to have a high level of performance throughout the coming season, and we are very much in the market looking for players. We have a lot of targets and as I said last season we certainly won’t be bringing players to the club who we haven’t done our homework on. “You’ll see a bit of action at this club over the coming days. At the same time Junior Ogedi came to this club five days before the start of the season last year. We had players in on trial at this time last year and they didn’t fit the bill but that’s just the nature of it. “The league is quite quiet at the minute and you only have to look at Dundalk who have only signed two players, but let’s not forget we have Walter Figueira here, we have Conor Clford, Connor McCormack and we have signed someone from Sheffield United so let’s not underestimate the work that has been done. We are fully aware that we have to bring in a high level of player and we will do that, there’s no doubt about that.” googletag.cmd.push QualityCity kick off their new season with a trip to champions Dundalk on February , and Devine believes that the entire Premier Division this season is as strongest as it has ever been.“This is the toughest I’ve seen the league in a number of years,” he stated. “You only have to look at Shelbourne coming up to replace UCD and I think St. Pat’s are going to invest in their new manager quite heavily. You have Bohemians who have signed  players, Shamrock Rovers who have six full internationals and Dundalk who are hoping to break into the group stages of the Champions League. “We can’t underestimate anyone, and looking at ourselves we also have to strive to get better and make sure that the fundamentals that were part of our plan last year stay the same. We are under no illusions that we will have to work extremely hard because that’s in our DNA.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The  year-old and co-driver Brian Hoy will face in the European Rally Championship this season. “Its nice to get it and we are going in the right direction,” beamed an enthusiastic Devine, in an interview with the County Derry Post. Last year, , was somewhat of a break after the WRC but he was asked by Hyundaihe would be interested in taking part in Rally Hungary. “They put together a deal for me to do that along with Motorsport Ireland. They said theyd give me a chance, it went well and we finished third,” Devine recalls. googletag.cmd.push Devine, who was recently crowned Irish International Driver of the Year, was full of praise for Hyundai, Motorsport Ireland and to John Coyne for making it all happen. After winning the Billy Coleman Young Driver of the Year in , Callum debuted in the Junior WRC with some notable performances, none more than his debut in the snow of Rally Sweden where he finished sixth. Casting his mind back to the experiences of that season and all its thrills and spills, it was something he always felt he would back to. In Rally Portugal, he was comfortable in second place before a steering fault forced him to retire with three stages to go. When the championship was complete he lay in fourth place overall,  points behind third placed Jean-Baptiste Franceschi. googletag.cmd.push “I remember going to Corsica. Wed be writing notes for the stage, then watching a DVD to check your notes. “Youd be in bed late and up early in the morning, it would be demanding on the body but look...It was a bit of a shock to the system. “It was a good unseen learning year for us. It is a lot more demanding than anybody every thinks until you are in it.” Devine name checked the likes of Craig Breen and Chris Meeke as some of those who were an ear to listen to, giving him the support. Round one of this years European circuit takes place on the Azores, off the coast of Portugal in late March. For now, his preparation is about keeping the body ticking over, getting out for a run to hone his fitness. “Come mid-February, we will do some testing in the car to figure out the set-up and what we have to work with. “The Azores is going to be the most dficult one , it is a really specialist event. There are a lot of gravelly roads, it will be demanding but I am looking forward to it. We are looking to get around it , to get some points and get off to a good enough start.” What would Devine see as a success from this season  “Realistically,” he began. “There is an U category in the championship. It is a junior category for R cars. We would be trying to mix it with the guys, to try and race for honours in that. “I will leave the rest to figure itself out. Usuallyyou are quick enough in the Us, you are never that far away from the main category. “We know we have the pace for tarmac, it is just the gravel. It is about getting used to it and getting up to speed again.” In the Azores, he will be up against drivers who have raced on the circuit three or four times, experience that is priceless at this level. Last season, Hungary was the only round that was new to the championship and on a level playing field Devine achieved a podium finish. He believes in himself, but hurdling around corners on roads you have never navigated before requires confidence. Devine is also grounded and realistic. “We are not saying it is going to be an easy challenge but you have to take the opportunity when it is there and get stuck in.” The  ERC calendar is as follows: Round : Azores Rallye , - MarchRound : Rally Islas Canarias , - MayRound : Rally Liepāja , - MayRound : th Rally Poland , - JuneRound : Rally di Roma Capitale , - JulyRound : Barum Czech Rally Zliacuten , - AugustRound : Cyprus Rally , - OctoberRound : Rally Hungary , - November Callum and Brian’s  season will be supported by FYTH, Curran Gate, The Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai Customer Racing.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue. I support that concept too.On the wider political issue, Baroness Ritchie said devolved institutions need to be up and running in Northern Ireland, expressing hope that the current Stormont talks process will bear fruit for the local population.ldquoThat is what the population is yearning for and what I hope can be achieved to help achieve a healing process and a period of moderation.Turning to the weeks and months ahead, Baroness Ritchie said she hopes that during her time in the House of Lords mdash along with other Lords and Baronesses mdash she wants to work towards building reconciliation, fairness, equality and a shared society in Northern Ireland, explaining that this requires a plan to ldquoend ision and bring down the physical and mental walls of ision.She declared: ldquoI would hope that we can work across this House to achieve that process of moderation and peaceful politics in Northern Ireland a comprehensive trade deal with the EU to assist our economy and a plan to end austerity and poverty and ensure proper financial mitigations are in place to deal with the punitive rigours of welfare reform.ldquoClimate change needs to be tackled, just look at the floods in Britain and the intensity of the heat in Australia which has resulted in the bush fires, and whilst reference is made to tackling it in the Queenrsquos Speech, this issue needs international efforts. I believe continued membership of the EU is required to address and offset manrsquos inhumanity to our precious planet.Baroness Ritchie concluded her speech by highlighting how much she is looking forward to working with colleagues across the House on a range of policy issues over the coming months and years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Meeting.jpg","title":"Meeting called to address Saintfield sewage issues  ","story":"THE current ban on new development in Saintfield will be discussed at the end of the month when local politicians meet with senior officials from NI Water.The temporary ban was imposed by the organisation in July  after it confirmed that it was not permitting new connections to the townrsquos sewer system.With Saintfieldrsquos sewage treatment plant approaching the end of its capacity, NI Water is in the process of completing a comprehensive drainage area planning model for the town, with the exercise also focusing on the treatment plant which continues to comply with all stringent environmental discharge standards.The detailed study was ordered in the wake of a number of sewage spills at the Old Grand Jury Road in the town during periods of heavy rain.NI Water engineers have installed special valves along sections of the sewer network at this part of the town in a bid to prevent future spills but have confirmed that no additional work is planned until the drainage area study has been completed. This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Lidl said a large number of reports have been submitted with the planning application which confirm that the proposal will have no ldquoadverse effects on the environment or amenity of local residents.In addition, the supermarket giant says its development plan will regenerate a brownfield site with ldquomodern, attractive buildings and has signicant economic benefits.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.In addition, it will be argued today that in determining the planning application and making a recommendation to councillors, the local authority has done so without a thorough assessment having been undertaken and without being furnished with all the necessary information required to support a robust decision that the ldquoproposal to build on any particular site is acceptable, in principle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Plea.jpg","title":"Plea for opt in organ donation discussions  ","story":"LOCAL politicians are to examine how they can promote the importance of organ donation.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working with the South Eastern and Southern health trusts on the issue, with many councillors keen to see plans for an opt out system.This means that people would agree to donate their organs with those who do not wish to do this signing a register. However, this does not currently exist.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, a letter from the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Health confirmed that there are no plans in place at present to introduce so-called opt out legislation.However, Mr Richard Pengelly said that work is continuing to achieve higher rates of donation and transplantation to ensure that more people are able to receive the gt of an organ.It is estimated that someone dies every six weeks in Northern Ireland waiting for an organ donation.At Monday nightrsquos council meeting, Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owen said she was not surprised at the content of Mr Pengelleyrsquos letter, explaining that there is not much he can do without the required legislation being in place.ldquoIs there anything we can do at council level  she asked.ldquoA lot of the things we would hear on this issue from people is that it is something they have never really thought about or spoken to their family about.

Is there anything that we can do to educate people and push a bit more on this issue as far as people putting themselves on the donor register  she asked.Cllr Roisin Mulgrew said organ donation was an issue she highlighted during her year as the districtrsquos first citizen, explaining that workshops were held involving a number of young people who spoke with representatives from the ldquoBraveheart organisation.She described the event as ldquohugely successful and suggested the organ donation issue could be one for discussions across the districtrsquos DEAs.Cllr Mulgrew added: ldquoOrgan donation is a conversation families hope that they do not have to have. There is an appetite for information on this issue.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews also backed the suggestion for the organ donation issue to be discussed at DEA level and said it should also be discussed with the Education Authority and local health trusts.Council director Michael Lipsett confirmed that he will be bringing a report on the organ donation issue to a future meeting of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee.He said the report will focus on how the council is going to approach the issue and will contain information on its work with the Public Health Authority, local health trusts and Education Authority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 PSNI.jpg","title":"PSNI helicopter used in search after attempted burglaries at weekend  ","story":"POLICE have been praised for their swt response to an incident in Killyleagh last Sunday after reports of attempted break-ins at homes in the town.A helicopter was deployed as part of a major operation which subsequently resulted in the arrest of a  year-old man near Killinchy.Connor Martin Haughey, of Forest Street, Belfast, appeared in court in Newtownards yesterday charged with a series of offences including burglary, taking and damaging a vehicle, no insurance and possessing as an article with a blade or point in a public place.The case was adjourned, with Haughey remanded in custody until January  when he is due to appear at Downpatrick Court.The ious charges he faces are in connection with burglaries in the Saintfield and Killinchy areas. It is understood he was arrested after police received a number of reports of suspicious activity in the Ringhaddy area, near Killinchy.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker has praised police for their swt response to the incident and has urged people to review their home security and ensure that their front and rear doors are locked at all times.He said a suspicious car in the Grove and Kerry estates sparked alarm last Sunday with residents calling for the police who responded swtly, deploying a number of officers, including aerial support via the PSNI helicopter.ldquoI would appeal to people to ensure that their doors are locked at all times, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI would also encourage people across the district to check in with their elderly neighbours and remind them to never open their doors to strangers.ldquoPolice were swtly on the scene in Killyleagh last Sunday which was very reassuring for residents who very much appreciated the quick response, he continued.The Rowallane politician also encouraged elderly residents in particular not to open their doors to strangers.He said residents concerned about people calling at their homes should always be asked to show their ID accreditation for the organisation they claim to represent.ldquoVirtually all staff from ious organisations now carry ID cards which feature a photograph of the person carrying it.

Work in the area is expected to take around four weeks to complete.Phoenix says while it understands that its planned programme of work will cause some disruption, it will take all relevant measures to mitigate this. In addition, the company says it is pleased that the interest levels from homeowners in Downpatrick wishing to connect to the gas network have been consistently strong.In a letter to local politicians, Phoenix says that it continues to receive regular queries from householders that donrsquot currently have access to the mains network, encouraging the company to make gas available as quickly as possible.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has asked residents and commuters in the town to remain patient as work on the multi-million pound scheme continues to provide householders and businesses access to a new form of energy.ldquoPhoenix has written to residents who are most likely to be affected by the next phase of pipe-laying to ensure that they are fully aware of what is being proposed, he continued.ldquoThe company recognises that its investment does result in disruption but is quick to resolve issues when they arise. The poundm investment across East Down to deliver natural gas is very signicant.Cllr Curran also praised Phoenix for its engagement with residents and the business community as it rolls out its pipe-laying programme across the county town in particular.The Downpatrick councillor has also confirmed that he plans to contact Phoenix officials to discuss the potential for weekend working as part of the drive to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said while the arrival of natural gas has been welcomed in many quarters, Phoenix faces the unenviable task of delivering a y construction scheme while keeping residents and business owners reasonably happy.He added: ldquoThe company has done its very best to date and there is no doubt that delivering the natural gas network is challenging. It is also not without its dficulties at times due to ious factors outside the companyrsquos control.ldquoAs work continues this week and over the months ahead, it is important that people remain patient and understanding as contractors get on with the job of providing consumers with increased choice when it comes to selecting their energy provider..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th January 2020 Twelfth.jpg","title":"Twelfth child for Saintfield couple  ","story":"MEET the Donoghues mdash now officially the largest family in Northern Ireland.The Saintfield family entered the record books when baby daughter Molly mdash their th child mdash arrived on New Yearrsquos Day.Molly, who weighed lb oz, was born at the Ulster Hospital shortly after  noon last Wednesday.Dad Johnand mum Tessa , were thrilled to introduce little Molly to her  siblings ndash six brothers and five sisters mdash who waited excitedly to welcome her home.Saying good night in the Donoghue household sounds more like a classroom roll call.

The sides were still locked after extra-time and at the end of five penalties apiece when James McClean drilled Olympic - ahead.It was then left to Walsh to break the deadlock when he kept out Ruairi Fitzpatrickrsquos well-struck spot kick to seal victory before he was mobbed by his delighted team-mates.Rathfriland certainly looked the part early doors as they sprayed the ball to both flanks where Fitzpatrick and Thomas Lockhart took full advantage.Fitzpatrick, in particular, ran at Dalton Tate at every opportunity, but Rathfriland failed to take advantage of his wing trickery.The first real shot in anger came in the th minute when Olympicrsquos Anton McGrattan tested Parr, but the big custodian saved with ease.Five minutes later at the other end Dalton Tate produced a telling tackle on the edge of the six yard box to deny Fitzpatrick a certain goal.However, from the resulting corner, Stephen Hughes bundled the ball over the line when Lockhartrsquos delivery caused mayhem.Rathfriland continued to play the ball methodically through the middle where Andy Kilmartin and Hughes were dominant and with  minutes gone they teamed up with Fitzpatrick to carve out another opening for Harry Campbell, but he shot straight at Walsh.Ruairi Cunningham then created an opening for Fitzpatrick, but he was way off target as was Lockhart in the th minute. A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney.

The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
